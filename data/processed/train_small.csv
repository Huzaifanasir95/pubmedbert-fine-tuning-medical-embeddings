"With the progression of global aging, neurological diseases in elderly individuals have aroused widespread interest among researchers. Imbalances in the homeostasis of neuronal microenvironments, including neural progenitor cells and microglia, are the leading cause of worsening neurodegenerative diseases. The aging of various glial cells can further lead to abnormal functions in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have shown that aging plays a vital role in a variety of degenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). In this manuscript, we describe the molecular mechanisms of aging, the cellular constitution of the neural microenvironment and the progression of aging in various neurodegenerative diseases, providing new targets and perspectives for the clinical treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases.","The continuous evolution of cancer therapy has driven the exploration of novel strategies to improve treatment specificity and efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. This article examines two innovative approaches that offer new directions in targeting cancer cells. The first approach focuses on developing antibodies that specifically bind to peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of immunotherapy. The second approach introduces quinazoline compounds that target and inhibit critical tyrosine kinases in cancer progression. Together, these advancements represent promising strides in the quest to develop more effective and precise cancer therapies, offering promising new avenues for treating resistant and aggressive forms of cancer.",0
"SummaryBackgroundMycobacterium tuberculosis is the main causative agent of tuberculosis. BCG, the only licensed vaccine, provides inadequate protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. Controlled human infection models are useful tools for vaccine development. We aimed to determine a safe dose of aerosol-inhaled live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG as a surrogate for M tuberculosis infection, then compare the safety and tolerability of infection models established using aerosol-inhaled and intradermally administered BCG.MethodsThis phase 1 controlled human infection trial was conducted at two clinical research facilities in the UK. Healthy, immunocompetent adults aged 18–50 years, who were both M tuberculosis-naive and BCG-naive and had no history of asthma or other respiratory diseases, were eligible for the trial. Participants were initially enrolled into group 1 (receiving the BCG Danish strain); the trial was subsequently paused because of a worldwide shortage of BCG Danish and, after protocol amendment, was restarted using the BCG Bulgaria strain (group 2). After a dose-escalation study, during which participants were sequentially allocated to receive either 1 × 103, 1 × 104, 1 × 105, 1 × 106, or 1 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) of aerosol BCG, the maximum tolerated dose was selected for the randomised controlled trial. Participants in this trial were randomly assigned (9:12), by variable block randomisation and using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes, to receive aerosol BCG (1 × 107 CFU) and intradermal saline or intradermal BCG (1 × 106 CFU) and aerosol saline. Participants were masked to treatment allocation until day 14. The primary outcome was to compare the safety of a controlled human infection model based on aerosol-inhaled BCG versus one based on intradermally administered BCG, and the secondary outcome was to evaluate BCG recovery in the airways of participants who received aerosol BCG or skin biopsies of participants who received intradermal BCG. BCG was detected by culture and by PCR. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02709278, and is complete.FindingsParticipants were assessed for eligibility between April 7, 2016, and Sept 29, 2018. For group 1, 15 participants were screened, of whom 13 were enrolled and ten completed the study; for group 2, 60 were screened and 33 enrolled, all of whom completed the study. Doses up to 1 × 107 CFU aerosol-inhaled BCG were sufficiently well tolerated. No significant difference was observed in the frequency of adverse events between aerosol and intradermal groups (median percentage of solicited adverse events per participant, post-aerosol vs post-intradermal BCG: systemic 7% [IQR 2–11] vs 4% [1–13], p=0·62; respiratory 7% [1–19] vs 4% [1–9], p=0·56). More severe systemic adverse events occurred in the 2 weeks after aerosol BCG (15 [12%] of 122 reported systemic adverse events) than after intradermal BCG (one [1%] of 94; difference 11% [95% CI 5–17]; p=0·0013), but no difference was observed in the severity of respiratory adverse events (two [1%] of 144 vs zero [0%] of 97; 1% [−1 to 3]; p=0·52). All adverse events after aerosol BCG resolved spontaneously. One serious adverse event was reported—a participant in group 2 was admitted to hospital to receive analgesia for a pre-existing ovarian cyst, which was deemed unrelated to BCG infection. On day 14, BCG was cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage samples after aerosol infection and from skin biopsy samples after intradermal infection.InterpretationThis first-in-human aerosol BCG controlled human infection model was sufficiently well tolerated. Further work will evaluate the utility of this model in assessing vaccine efficacy and identifying potential correlates of protection.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley Clinical Research Network, and TBVAC2020.","AbstractNecroptosis, a cell death mechanism with the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. Induction of necroptosis for cancer therapy may be possible through the regulation of the expression of a key factor gene receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3 (RIPK3) via in vitro transcription (IVT) mRNA delivery. However, mRNA is susceptible to degradation and has a low delivery efficiency, which highlights the requirement of a proper delivery vehicle for intracellular delivery. Therefore, a new mRNA delivery system based on the nanostructured silica nanoparticles, termed mRNA‐protective nanocage (mPN) has been developed. High‐efficiency expression of RIPK3 and induction of necroptosis is achieved through delivery of RIPK3 IVT mRNA with mPN in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, the mPN carrying RIPK3 mRNA distributed locally in tumors upon intravascular injection, and successfully induced necroptosis and immune cell infiltration, a hallmark of necroptosis. the suppression of tumor growth in a murine cancer model, demonstrating the synergistic effect of RIPK3 mRNA‐ and immune cell‐mediated therapy is also observed. These findings suggest the potential for anticancer therapy through necroptosis induction and provide a strategy for the development of mRNA‐based nanomedicine.",0
"AbstractBackgroundMSA-2, as an oral molecule for activating STING signaling pathway to cure the tumor entering clinical trials. The toxicity of MSA-2 has aroused wide concern, especially the reproductive toxicity can not be ignored.ObjectivesWe synthesized the STING agonist (MSA-2) and its derivative manganese-MSA-2 (MSA-2-Mn) and investigated the reproductive toxicity.MethodsWe evaluated the reproductive effects of MSA-2 and MSA-2-Mn in female mice under the administration alone and on the reproductive system of male mice in the presence or absence of combined radiation.ResultsResults suggested that MSA-2 and MSA-2-Mn have negligible reproductive toxicity in healthy adults. Conclusions: This provides new ideas to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, as well as favorable evidence for future systemic dosing in patients of reproductive age and clinical trials of immunotherapy.","Cancer is a global public health issue and remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States . It is estimated in the US in 2022, about 935,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in women, and the probability of developing invasive cancer is 5.8% for females younger than 50 years old . However, advances in screening programs, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic options have greatly increased the five-year survival rate in reproductive-age women with a variety of cancers. Given the clinical consequences of gonadotoxic cancer therapies, young, female cancer survivors may face compromised fertility, premature ovarian insufficiency, early-onset menopause, and endocrine dysregulation . Gonadotoxic side effects may include decreased oocyte quality within surviving follicles, loss of ovarian follicles, and impaired ovarian function. In reproductive-age women, oocyte quality is an important element for successful clinical pregnancies and healthy offspring as poor-quality oocytes may be a cause of infertility (3–5). Thus, it is critical to determine the quantity and quality of surviving follicles in the ovary after cancer treatment and to assess oocyte quality within those surviving follicles as these are markers for determining the capacity for ovarian function restoration and future fertility, especially for young cancer survivors . The long-term effects of cancer therapeutics on oocyte quality are influenced by factors including, but not limited to, individual patient characteristics (for example age, health history, comorbidities, etc.), disease type, or treatment regimen . These effects may translate clinically into an impaired production of viable oocytes and compromised fertility .",0
"In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical research, the emergence of RNA-based therapeutics is paradigm shifting. It is mainly driven by the molecular adaptability and capacity to provide precision in targeting. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic crisis underscored the effectiveness of the mRNA therapeutic development platform and brought it to the forefront of RNA-based interventions. These RNA-based therapeutic approaches can reshape gene expression, manipulate cellular functions, and correct the aberrant molecular processes underlying various diseases. The new technologies hold the potential to engineer and deliver tailored therapeutic agents to tackle genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases in a highly personalized and precisely tuned manner. The review discusses the most recent advancements in the field of mRNA therapeutics for cancer treatment, with a focus on the features of the most utilized RNA-based therapeutic interventions, current pre-clinical and clinical developments, and the remaining challenges in delivery strategies, effectiveness, and safety considerations.","ObjectiveTo analyze the relationship between dual-energy spectral CT and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.MethodsThe quantitative parameters of spectral CT were analyzed in 208 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The quantitative parameters including CT40keV and CT70keV values, effective atomic number (Zeff), iodine concentration (IC), water concentration (WC), and the slope of the spectral curve (λ HU) were calculated. Statistical analysis was used to determine the clinical characteristics and quantitative parameters for the diagnosis of EGFR-mutation status. The ROC curves were used to calculate diagnostic efficiency.ResultsSex (p = 0.027) and smoking history (p = 0.019) differed significantly according to the EGFR-mutation status. Spectral CT quantitative parameters (CT40keV and CT70keV values, λ HU, Zeff and IC) differed significantly between the EGFR mutant and the EGFR wild-type groups (p < 0.05) during the arterial phase (AP) and venous phase (VP). However, WC was not statistically different between the two groups (p > 0.05). ROC curve analysis revealed the combination of the significantly different quantitative parameters provided the best diagnostic performance for determining the EGFR-mutation status (AUC: 76.0%) in the AP, while the AUC during the VP was 75.6%.ConclusionThe quantitative parameters of dual-energy spectral CT have potential value for identifying the EGFR-mutation status.",0
"Objective.Social determinants of health (SDOH) impact cancer outcomes. The CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) integrates scores for four neighborhood-based SDOH domains (socioeconomic status, household characteristics, minority status, and housing type/transportation) to assess neighborhood social vulnerability (NSV). While NSV has been associated with overall cancer mortality and lung, breast, colon, and endometrial cancer-specific mortality, the relationship between NSV as defined by the SVI and ovarian cancer outcomes remains unknown.Methods.We used data from 177 patients enrolled in an observational ovarian cancer cohort study from October 2012 through September 2022. All patients underwent debulking surgery and completed an entire course of standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy. Follow-up was completed through May 2024. SVI was calculated using census tract at diagnosis. High NSV was defined as SVI in the top quartile of the cohort. Cox proportional hazard models assessed the association between NSV and progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival.Results.After accounting for demographic and clinical factors, high NSV was associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:2.31 [95% CI:1.48–3.61]; P < 0.001) and OS (HR:1.79 [95% CI:1.10–2.92]; P = 0.02), with neighborhood socioeconomic status associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:2.29 [95% CI:1.47–3.56]; P < 0.001) and OS (HR:1.71 [95% CI:1.04–2.80]; P = 0.03). Neighborhood housing type/transportation was also associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:1.65 [95% CI:1.07–2.55]; P = 0.02) and trended towards worse OS (HR:1.43 [95% CI:0.80–2.33]).Conclusion and relevance.Higher neighborhood social vulnerability is associated with worse outcomes among ovarian cancer patients. Validating these results in a population-based cohort and assessing programs to reduce neighborhood social vulnerability to improve ovarian cancer outcomes is warranted.","SUMMARYHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 (HSV-1) is a highly successful neurotropic pathogen that primarily infects the epithelial cells lining the orofacial mucosa. After primary lytic replication in the oral, ocular, and nasal mucosal epithelial cells, HSV-1 establishes life-long latency in neurons within the trigeminal ganglion. Patients with compromised immune systems experience frequent reactivation of HSV-1 from latency, leading to virus entry in the sensory neurons, followed by anterograde transport and lytic replication at the innervated mucosal epithelial surface. Although recurrent infection of the corneal mucosal surface is rare, it can result in a chronic immuno-inflammatory condition called herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK). HSK leads to gradual vision loss and can cause permanent blindness in severe untreated cases. Currently, there is no cure or successful vaccine to prevent latent or recurrent HSV-1 infections, posing a significant clinical challenge to managing HSK and preventing vision loss. The conventional clinical management of HSK primarily relies on anti-virals to suppress HSV-1 replication, anti-inflammatory drugs (such as corticosteroids) to provide symptomatic relief from pain and inflammation, and surgical interventions in more severe cases to replace damaged cornea. However, each clinical treatment strategy has limitations, such as local and systemic drug toxicities and the emergence of anti-viral-resistant HSV-1 strains. In this review, we summarize the factors and immune cells involved in HSK pathogenesis and highlight alternate therapeutic strategies for successful clinical management of HSK. We also discuss the therapeutic potential of immunoregulatory cytokines and immunometabolism modulators as promising HSK therapies against emerging anti-viral-resistant HSV-1 strains.",0
"AimThe aim of this study was to construct and validate a nomogram to predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) in external ear melanoma (EEM) patients in the elderly based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.MethodsThe information of patients diagnosed with EEM in the elderly between 2010 and 2014 was downloaded from the SEER database. Univariable and multivariable Cox analyses were carried out to identify the independent characteristics, and the independent factors were further included to construct a nomogram. The discriminative ability and calibration of the nomogram to predict OS were tested using C-index value, and calibration plots. Based on the risk score of the nomogram, the patients were divided into high- and low-risk subgroup. Finally, the survival differences of different subgroups were explored by Kaplan–Meier curves. All statistical analyses were performed by R 4.2.0.ResultsA total of 710 elderly EMM patients were included and randomly divided into training cohort and validation cohort. Univariable Cox regression were used to identify age, race, sex, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), T, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tumor size as independent risk factors. Then, multivariable Cox model to determine significant risk factors was used to establish the selected factors. A nomogram for predicting the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was constructed using the independent variables including age, AJCC, T, surgery and chemotherapy. The C-index values were 0.78 (95% CI 0.75–0.81) in training set and 0.72 (95% CI 0.66–0.78) in validation set. The calibration curves were closer to ideal curves indicated the accurate predictive ability of this nomogram. The elderly patients with EEM in the low-risk group showed a longer OS than patients in the high-risk group in both training and validation cohorts.ConclusionsOur study established and validated a novel model to predict 1-, 3- and 5-year OS for EEM. The individualized nomogram has a good prognostic ability and can be used as a new survival prediction tool for the elderly patients with EMM.","BackgroundGastric cancer (GC) remains a global challenge due to its high morbidity and mortality rates especially in Asia as well as poor response to treatment. As a member of the adhesion protein family and transmembrane glycoprotein, EpCAM expressed excessively in cancer cells including GC cells. The database assay showed that EpCAM is excessively expressed and easily mutated in cancers, especially in early stage of GC.MethodsTo explore the roles EpCAM plays in oncogenesis and progression of GC, the expression of EpCAM was deleted in GC cells with CRISPR/Cas9 method, and then the changes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility and motility associated microstructures in EpCAM-deleted GC cells (EpCAM-/-SGC7901) were detected to evaluate the rules EpCAM played.ResultsThe results showed that EpCAM deletion caused cell proliferation, motility and the development of motility-relevant microstructures inhibited significantly, apoptotic trend and contact inhibition enhanced in EpCAM-deleted GC cells. The results of western blot suggested that EpCAM modulates the expression of epithelial/endothelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) correlated genes. All results as above indicated that EpCAM plays important roles to enhance the oncogenesis, malignancy and progression as a GC enhancer.ConclusionsCombining our results and published data together, the interaction of EpCAM with other proteins was also discussed and concluded in the discussion. Our results support that EpCAM can be considered as a novel target for the diagnosis and therapy of GC in future.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04767-2.",0
"Background:More than 50% of patients with lung cancer are admitted to the hospital while receiving treatment, which is a burden to patients and the healthcare system. This study characterizes the risk factors and outcomes of patients with lung cancer who were admitted to the hospital.Methods:A multidisciplinary oncology care team conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients with lung cancer admitted in 2018. Demographics, disease and admission characteristics, and end-of-life care utilization were recorded. Following a multidisciplinary consensus review process, admissions were determined to be either “avoidable” or “unavoidable.” Generalized estimating equation logistic regression models assessed risks and outcomes associated with avoidable admissions.Results:In all, 319 admissions for 188 patients with a median age of 66 years (IQR, 59–74 years) were included. Cancer-related symptoms accounted for 65% of hospitalizations. Common causes of unavoidable hospitalizations were unexpected disease progression causing symptoms, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, and infection. Of the 47 hospitalizations identified as avoidable (15%), the median overall survival was 1.6 months compared with 9.7 months (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.34–3.19; P<.001) for unavoidable hospitalizations. Significant reasons for avoidable admissions included cancer-related pain (P = .02), hypervolemia (P = .03), patient desire to initiate hospice services (P = .01), and errors in medication reconciliation or distribution (P<.001). Errors in medication management caused 26% of the avoidable hospitalizations. Of admissions in patients receiving immunotherapy (n = 102) or targeted therapy (n = 44), 9% were due to adverse effects of treatment. Patients receiving immunotherapy and targeted therapy were at similar risk of avoidable hospitalizations compared with patients not receiving treatment (P = .3 and P = .1, respectively).Conclusions:We found that 15% of hospitalizations among patients with lung cancer were potentially avoidable. Uncontrolled symptoms, delayed implementation of end-of-life care, and errors in medication reconciliation were associated with avoidable inpatient admissions. Symptom management tools, palliative care integration, and medication reconciliations may mitigate hospitalization risk.","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) represents a grave challenge as it is characterized by high fatality rates and irreversible progression without effective clinical interventions available at present. Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) by an N-terminal inhibitor disrupts its interaction with TGFβRII, leading to the instability of TGFβRII, thus blocking the role of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which could potentially ameliorate IPF symptoms. However, given that the broad spectrum of HSP90 N-terminal inhibitors may lead to unanticipated side effects, we hypothesize that C-terminal inhibitors of HSP90 can interfere with TGFβRII while minimizing adverse reactions. In this study, silybin, a C-terminal inhibitor of HSP90, was separated into monomers, and silybin A was screened for its superior efficacy against TGFβRII. To facilitate targeted therapy for treating IPF, a cell membrane hybrid liposome loaded with silybin A (Cm-A-Lip) was developed to deliver silybin A to lung fibroblasts through pulmonary drug delivery. A bleomycin-induced IPF mouse model was used to evaluate the efficacy of Cm-A-Lip. By examination of lung hydroxyproline content, wet weight, histology, and inflammatory factor expression, the results showed that pulmonary delivery of Cm-A-Lip could increase the drug retention time in lung tissue compared with intravenous injection. Furthermore, Cm-A-Lip exhibited superior antifibrotic activity relative to conventional liposmomes loaded with silybin A (A-Lip) while concurrently mitigating systemic inflammatory responses associated with silybin A administration, thus enhancing the overall safety profile.",0
"ABSTRACTCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a powerful measure of minimal residual disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although immunotherapy has been widely established in metastatic CRC that is mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H), its role in non-metastatic CRC is rapidly evolving. In resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage II CRC, adjuvant fluoropyrimidine has no benefit and is not recommended. There is growing evidence to suggest diminished benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation in localized CRC that is dMMR/MSI-H. We present two cases of dMMR/MSI-H stage III CRC treated with definitive surgery wherein adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy led to a failure to clear postoperative plasma ctDNA levels, prompting a change to immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab and resultant ctDNA clearance. We illustrate that chemotherapy may achieve suboptimal disease control in localized colon cancer that is dMMR/MSI-H, while plasma ctDNA offers a window of opportunity to gauge the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy to clear microscopic disease in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer. These findings are important to contextualize given that relapse is inevitable with failure to clear MRD in the postoperative stage I-III CRC setting whereby chemotherapy remains the standard adjuvant therapy in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer.","Anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) improve the prognosis of high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB). Worldwide experience almost exclusively involves toddlers and older patients treated after multi-modality or 2nd-line therapies, that is, many months post-diagnosis. In contrast, at our center, infants received anti-GD2 mAbs because this immunotherapy started during or immediately after induction chemotherapy. We now report on the feasibility, safety, and long-term survival in this vulnerable age group.Thirty-three HR-NB patients were <19 months old when started on 3F8 (murine mAb; n=21) or naxitamab (humanized-3F8; n=12), with 30-90” intravenous infusions. Patients received analgesics and antihistamines. Common toxicities (pain, urticaria, cough) were manageable, allowing outpatient treatment. Capillary leak, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and mAb-related long-term toxicities did not occur. Two 3F8 cycles were aborted due to bradycardia (a pre-existing condition) and asthmatic symptoms, respectively. One patient received ½ dose of day 1 naxitamab because of hypotension; full doses were subsequently administered. Post-mAb treatments included chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and anti-NB vaccine. Among 3F8 patients, 17/21 are in complete remission off all treatment at 5.6+-to-24.1+ (median 13.4+) years from diagnosis. Among naxitamab patients, 10/12 remain relapse-free post-mAb at 1.7+-to-4.3+ (median 3.1+) years from diagnosis. Toxicity was similar with short outpatient infusions and matched that observed with these and other anti-GD2 mAbs in older patients. These findings were reassuring given that naxitamab is dosed >2.5x higher (~270mg/m2/cycle) than 3F8, dinutuximab, and dinutuximab beta (70-100mg/m2/cycle). HR-NB in infants proved to be highly curable.",1
"PurposeCancer vaccine (CV) has thrived as a promising tool for cancer prevention and treatment. However, how to maintain the integrity and diversity of individualized vaccine antigens and activate the adaptive immune system is still challenging.MethodsHerein, a preventive and therapeutic vaccine platform for in situ effective multi-model synergistic therapy is developed. In our study, we process B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen (LNF) to obtain LNF cells, the characterization of LNF cells were conducted. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect and immune activation ability were studied, and the role as a CV were investigated.ResultsThe LNF cells preserve intact cellular structure and tumor-associated self-antigen gp100. Moreover, LNF cells have the ability of loading and releasing doxorubicin (DOX). Except for the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy brought by DOX, the LNF cells can promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and induce immune response by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly with the existence of adjuvant, R848. Specifically, the CD8+ T cells of mice in LNF-DOX/R848 group are 6 times of that in PBS group in tumor microenvironment, and twice in spleen. Therefore, LNF cells can also be utilized as a CV. Vaccination with LNF/R848 cells effectively suppress the tumor growth in mice by fivefold as compared to the control group.ConclusionIn this work, we obtain the LNF cells with a simple procedure. The LNF cells not only provides a tumor cells-based multi-modal system for cancer therapy but inspires new insights into future development of individualized CVs strategies.Graphical AbstractThis study processes live B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen to obtain LNF cells, which preserve cell integrity and homologous targeting ability. The LNF cells can load and deliver drug and can serve as tumor vaccine. Results demonstrated the LNF cells have effective prophylactic ability, and ideal anti-tumor ability with the loaded drug and adjuvant.

This cell protection system, which is present in all tissues and functions at a basic level, can be up- or downregulated in response to various stresses. A disruption in the natural route of the autophagy process is frequently followed by an interruption in the inherent operation of the body’s cells and organs. Probiotics are live bacteria that protect the host through various mechanisms. One of the processes through which probiotics exert their beneficial effects on various cells and tissues is autophagy. Autophagy can assist in maintaining host homeostasis by stimulating the immune system and affecting numerous physiological and pathological responses.

"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated myocarditis is a rare but severe complication for patients treated with immunotherapy. This study aims to explore the predictive significance of patients’ clinical features and examination results for the severity of ICI-associated myocarditis.MethodsData from a real-world cohort of 81 cancer patients who developed ICI-associated myocarditis after immunotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. The development of myocarditis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3–5 and/or the major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was set as endpoints. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive value of each factor.ResultsCTCAE grades 3–5 and MACE developed in 43/81 (53.1%) and 28/81 (34.6%) cases, respectively. The likelihood of CTCAE grades 3–5 and MACE increased with the accumulation of organs affected by the ICI-associated adverse events and initial clinical symptoms. Concurrent systematic therapies during ICI treatment did not raise the risk of myocarditis severity, while prior chemotherapy did. Besides classical serum cardiac markers, a higher neutrophil ratio was also related to poorer cardiac outcomes, whereas higher lymphocyte and monocyte ratios were predictors of favorable cardiac outcomes. The CD4+ T cell ratio and CD4/CD8 ratio were negatively related to CTCAE grades 3–5. Several cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters were associated with myocarditis severity, whereas the predictive value of echocardiography and electrocardiogram was weak.ConclusionThis study comprehensively evaluated the prognostic value of patients’ clinical characteristics and examination results and identified several predictors of severe ICI-associated myocarditis, which will facilitate early detection of severe ICI-associated myocarditis in patients receiving immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04782-3.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the progressive destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Despite improvements in insulin monitoring techniques, there remains no cure for T1D. Individuals with T1D require lifelong insulin therapy and some develop life-threatening complications. T1D is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune condition. Understanding why people get T1D and how it progresses has advanced our knowledge of the disease and led to the discovery of specific targets that can be therapeutically manipulated to halt or reverse the course of T1D. Scientists investigating the potential of immunotherapy treatment for the treatment have recently had some encouraging results. Teplizumab, an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody that has been approved by the FDA, delays the onset of clinical T1D in patients ≥ 8 years of age with preclinical T1D and improves beta cell function. Therapies targeting beta cell health, vitality, and function are now thought to be an essential component of successful combination therapy for T1D. The idea that the beta cells themselves may influence their own destruction during the development of T1D is a notion that has recently been gaining acceptance in the field. Researchers have recently made remarkable strides in beta cell replacement therapy and beta cell regeneration techniques. This review offers a detailed exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms of T1D. It discusses the intricate interplay of factors leading to T1D development and the innovative approaches being explored to discover new treatments and a cure for the millions of people living with T1D worldwide.",0
"A rich pipeline of therapeutic candidates is advancing for Parkinson’s disease, many of which are targeting the underlying pathophysiology of disease. Emerging evidence grounded in novel genetics and biomarker discoveries is illuminating the true promise of precision medicine-based therapeutic strategies for PD. There has been a growing effort to investigate disease-modifying therapies by designing clinical trials for genetic forms of PD - providing a clearer link to underlying pathophysiology. Leading candidate genes based on human genetic findings that are under active investigation in an array of basic and translational models include SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA. Broad investigations across mechanistic models show that these genes signal through common molecular pathways, namely, autosomal lysosomal pathways, inflammation and mitochondrial function. Therapeutic clinical trials to date based on genetically defined targets have not yet achieved approvals; however, much is to be learned from such pioneering trials. Fundamental principles of drug development that include proof of pharmacology in target tissue are critical to have confidence in advancing such precision-based therapies. There is a clear need for downstream biomarkers of leading candidate therapies to demonstrate proof of mechanism. The current regulatory landscape is poised and primed to support translational modeling strategies for the effective advancement of PD disease-modifying therapeutic candidates. A convergence of rich complex data that is available, the regulatory framework of model informed drug development (MIDD), and the new biological integrated staging frameworks when combined are collectively setting the stage for advancing new approaches in PD to accelerate progress.

A reliable imaging marker to assess tissue viability after MI would help determine the risks and benefits of any intervention. In this study, we investigate whether a new mitochondria-targeted imaging agent, 18F-labeled 2’-deoxy-2’−18F-fluoro-9-β-d-arabinofuranosylguanine ([18F]F-AraG), a positron emission tomography (PET) agent developed for imaging activated T cells, is suitable for cardiac imaging and to test the myocardial viability after MI.Procedure:To test whether the myocardial [18F]-F-AraG signal is coming from cardiomyocytes or immune infiltrates, we compared cardiac signal in wild-type (WT) mice with that of T cell deficient Rag1 knockout (Rag1 KO) mice. We assessed the effect of dietary nucleotides on myocardial [18F]F-AraG uptake in normal heart by comparing [18F]F-AraG signals between mice fed with purified diet and those fed with purified diet supplemented with nucleotides. The myocardial viability was investigated in rodent model by imaging rat with [18F]F-AraG and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) before and after MI. All PET signals were quantified in terms of the percent injected dose per cc (%ID/cc). We also explored [18F]FDG signal variability and potential T cell infiltration into fibrotic area in the affected myocardium with H&E analysis.Results:The difference in %ID/cc for Rag1 KO and WT mice was not significant (p = ns) indicating that the [18F]F-AraG signal in the myocardium was primarily coming from cardiomyocytes. No difference in myocardial uptake was observed between [18F]F-AraG signals in mice fed with purified diet and with purified diet supplemented with nucleotides (p = ns). The [18F]FDG signals showed wider variability at different time points. Noticeable [18F]F-AraG signals were observed in the affected MI regions. There were T cells in the fibrotic area in the H&E analysis, but they did not constitute the predominant infiltrates.Conclusions:Our preliminary preclinical data show that [18F]F-AraG accumulates in cardiomyocytes indicating that it may be suitable for cardiac imaging and to evaluate the myocardial viability after MI.",0
"PurposeRadiotherapy is an integral treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, radiation-induced toxicities such as radiation pneumonitis (RP) present a considerable challenge. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the potential of salivary metabolomics as an independent risk factor for predicting RP.MethodsThis study included 62 consecutive patients with NSCLC who underwent thoracic radiotherapy at Tokyo Medical University between September 2016 and December 2018. The median age of the patients was 75 years (range: 41–89), comprising 47 (75.8%) males and 15 (24.2%) females. Patients with stage I NSCLC received 75 Gy in 30 fractions, whereas those with stage II and III NSCLC received 66 Gy in 33 fractions. Saliva samples were collected before treatment and at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after initiating radiotherapy. Clinical RP was defined as grade 2 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events. Salivary metabolomics were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Salivary metabolites were evaluated as potential predictors of RP.ResultsClinical RP was observed in 11 patients (17.7%); no RP-related deaths were observed. Clinical RP developed at a median of 4 months (range: 2–6 months) after initiating radiotherapy. Three metabolites, butyrate, propionate, and hexanoate, collected before radiotherapy exhibited predictive ability for clinical RP. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated butyrate (P = 0.033) as a predictive factor, along with the previously known factor of lung volume irradiated with > 20 Gy (P = 0.045).ConclusionSalivary metabolite butyrate was an independent risk factor for clinical RP.","ABSTRACTBackgroundThe infection prevention behaviours of kidney transplant recipients have been investigated, but the factors affecting these have not. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the infection prevention behaviours of kidney transplant recipients and the factors related to these.MethodsThe sample of this descriptive, cross‐sectional study included 148 kidney transplant recipients being followed in a kidney transplant outpatient clinic. Data were collected with a sociodemographic and clinical characteristics form, the Adherence to Measures against Infections Questionnaire and the Self‐Control and Self‐Management Scale between November 2022 and May 2023.ResultsThe mean age of the patients was 50.29 ± 13.11 years. The rate of self‐reported hand hygiene was 51%. Age caused a significant difference in receiving a vaccine against pneumonia and wearing a mask. The rate of self‐reported behaviour of rinsing vegetables was higher among the married patients compared to single patients. Self‐management created a significant difference in receiving a vaccine against influenza and pneumonia, eating salad in a café or restaurant and wearing a mask outside home and consuming raw food, delicatessen products and street food (p < 0.05).ConclusionThis study revealed that the kidney transplant recipients displayed incomplete infection prevention behaviours including hand hygiene. Infection prevention behaviours differed in terms of age and self‐control and self‐management. Education and interventions are needed to improve the infection prevention behaviours of kidney transplant recipients.Relevance to Clinical PracticeThis study illustrates the characteristics of, and relationship between, sociodemographic factors and self‐management of infection prevention behaviours in kidney transplant recipients.Reporting MethodStrengthening the reporting of cross‐sectional studies (STROBE) was followed.Patient ContributionThe study demonstrates that there is a need for interventions that will improve both the self‐management levels and infection protection behaviours of patients. Studies conducted in this direction will lead to a decrease in the infection rates of patients.",0
"PurposeThe aim of this study was to analyse the correlation of extracranial metastasis sites (ECMs) to the incidence risk of brain metastasis (BMs) in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods18349 newly diagnosed patients were retrospectively analysed, and 4919 pairs of cases were matched by propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio. Alternative factors were analysed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. And the interaction analysis and subgroup analysis were carried out. ResultsThe incidences of Brain, Lung, Liver, Bone, Multiple and Other metastasis were 26.9%, 20.2%, 4.6%, 19.9%, 16.9% and 38.3%, respectively. Results suggested that Age, Race, Histological type, Grade, T stage, N stage and Organ metastasis site were risk factors (p < 0.05). The interaction analysis suggested interaction effects between the Primary site, T stage, N stage and Organ metastasis site. The subgroup analysis showed that the Organ metastasis site and the risk of BMs were statistically significant except that the Overlapping subgroup (p = 0.267) of the Primary site. And the incidence risk of BMs in Lung metastasis, Liver metastasis and Bone metastasis groups was lower than that in other metastasis group (OR 1, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the Multiple metastasis group and the other metastasis group (OR 1.091, p = 0.169).ConclusionAdvanced age, non-Asian/Pacific Islander, non-squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated grade, and higher T/N stage were risk factors for increased BMs in stage IV NSCLC, and the ECMs were associated with the risk of BMs.","In single-cell sequencing analysis, several computational methods have been developed to map the cellular state space, but little has been done to map or create embeddings of the gene space. Here we formulate the gene embedding problem, design tasks with simulated single-cell data to evaluate representations, and establish ten relevant baselines. We then present a graph signal processing approach, called gene signal pattern analysis (GSPA), that learns rich gene representations from single-cell data using a dictionary of diffusion wavelets on the cell–cell graph. GSPA enables characterization of genes based on their patterning and localization on the cellular manifold. We motivate and demonstrate the efficacy of GSPA as a framework for diverse biological tasks, such as capturing gene co-expression modules, condition-specific enrichment and perturbation-specific gene–gene interactions. Then we showcase the broad utility of gene representations derived from GSPA, including for cell–cell communication (GSPA-LR), spatial transcriptomics (GSPA-multimodal) and patient response (GSPA-Pt) analysis.",0
"Giardia duodenalis, an important zoonotic protozoan parasite, adheres to host intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) via the ventral disc and causes giardiasis characterized mainly by diarrhea. To date, it remains elusive how excretory-secretory products (ESPs) of Giardia enter IECs and how the cells respond to the entry. Herein, we initially demonstrated that ESPs evoked IEC endocytosis in vitro. We indicated that ESPs contributed vitally in triggering intrinsic apoptosis, pro-inflammatory responses, tight junction (TJ) protein expressional changes, and autophagy in IECs. Endocytosis was further proven to be implicated in those ESPs-triggered IEC responses. Ten predicted virulent excretory-secretory proteins of G. duodenalis were investigated for their capability to activate clathrin/caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CME/CavME) in IECs. Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) was confirmed to be an important contributor. PNPO was subsequently verified as a vital promoter in the induction of giardiasis-related IEC apoptosis, inflammation, and TJ protein downregulation. Most importantly, this process seemed to be involved majorly in PNPO-evoked CME pathway, rather than CavME. Collectively, this study identified Giardia ESPs, notably PNPO, as potentially important pathogenic factors during noninvasive infection. It was also noteworthy that ESPs-evoked endocytosis might play a role in triggering giardiasis-inducing cellular regulation. These findings would deepen our understanding about the role of ESPs, notably PNPO, in the pathogenesis of giardiasis and the potential attributed endocytosis mechanism.","Circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary strategy in cancer immunotherapy, facilitating novel approaches to induce robust and durable immune responses. Unlike traditional linear messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development. This review delved into the fundamental principles underlying circRNA biology, highlighting their unique structural advantages and translational potential. We examined recent advancements in circRNA vaccine design, focusing on their application in oncology. As the circRNA-based cancer vaccine is a relatively novel technology, findings from all the major studies describing its efficacy were discussed. We further investigated their combination with other immunotherapeutic modalities, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies, that ensure the maximal anticancer effects of circRNA vaccines. Large-scale manufacturing, immunogenicity optimization, delivery systems, and other challenges and future directions in this field were also discussed. This study aims to thoroughly analyze the state-of-the-art and potential future applications of circRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy, highlighting them as exciting possibilities for next-generation cancer therapies.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDReplication-repair deficiency (RRD) stemming from mismatch repair and polymerase proofreading gene defects (MMRD/PPD) lead to hypermutant childhood cancers, most frequently brain tumors. While medulloblastoma is reported, the clinical, genomic and immune landscape remains unknown. METHODSWe analysed the genome, methylome, transcriptome (bulk, single-nuclei) and immune-microenvironment of the largest cohort of RRD-medulloblastoma patients enrolled by the International RRD Consortium and correlated these to clinical outcomes. RRD mice-models were used to preclinically assess response to immunotherapy. Results: RESULTSRRD-medulloblastoma (n=43) were enriched for anaplasia (61%) and localised disease (77%). Methylation/nano-string-based subgrouping failed to classify 40%, while the remaining clustered with the SHH-subgroup. Copy-number changes were notably infrequent (<20%). All tumors harboured hypermutation and microsatellite instability in contrast to non-RRD controls (p<0.0001). Pathogenic variants were frequent in POLE/POLD1 (80%), TP53 (48%) and SHH-pathway genes (PTCH1, SUFU, SMO: 56%). Interestingly, some tumors additionally had glioma-driver alterations (ATRX, NF1: ~50%), similar to RRD cerebellar glioblastoma, but distinct from both non-RRD medulloblastoma (n=791) and hemispheric glioblastoma (n=733) controls. Moreover, although bulk-transcriptome matched non-RRD SHH medulloblastoma, single-nuclei analyses suggested an earlier cell-of-origin potentially explaining the heterogenous phenotypes resulting from the driver mutations. Uniquely, immune analyses (gene expression and immunohistochemistry) demonstrated high intra-tumoral CD8 T-cell infiltration. Three-year progression-free survival was 60%. Outcome was worse for RRD-medulloblastoma harbouring TP53-mutation (p=0.04) and failing subgroup-classification (p=0.004). Nestin/Cre MSH2-/- POLE;p.S459F mice developing medulloblastoma recapitulated human disease and demonstrated response to anti-PD1 monotherapy. Recurrent/progressive human tumors including those harbouring TP53-mutations exhibited radiological responses to anti-PD1 monotherapy, which was associated with prolonged ongoing survival in comparison to those not treated with checkpoint-inhibitors (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONSHypermutant RRD-medulloblastoma reveal heterogenous phenotypes due to unique spectrum of driver mutations and an early cell of origin. Their immune-hot microenvironment allows successful salvage treatment with checkpoint-inhibitors for those failing chemo-radiation, including the high-risk SHH/TP53-mutant and unclassified subgroups.","Background:There is a growing literature base regarding menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination among premenopausal people. However, relatively little is known about uterine bleeding in postmenopausal people following COVID-19 vaccination.Objectives:To examine trends in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses over time before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction and describe cases of new-onset postmenopausal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design:All analyses focused on members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest ages 45 and older who were diagnosed with incident postmenopausal bleeding in the electronic medical record. Members with pre-existing postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding, or who were at increased risk of bleeding due to other health conditions, were excluded. We used segmented regression analysis to estimate changes in the incidence of postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses from 2018 through 2021 in Kaiser Permanente Northwest members meeting inclusion criteria, stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status in 2021. Additionally, we identified all members with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccination between December 14, 2020, through August 14, 2021, who had an incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnosis within 60 days of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination, diagnostic procedures, and presumed bleeding etiology were assessed through chart review and described. A temporal scan statistic was run on all cases without clear bleeding etiology.Results:In a population of approximately 80,000 individuals per month there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction (p=0.59). Among 48,438 vaccinated individuals, 104 had postmenopausal bleeding first diagnosed within 60 days following COVID-19 vaccination; 76% of cases (79/104) were confirmed as post-vaccination postmenopausal bleeding after chart review. Median time from vaccination to bleeding onset was 21 days (range: 2–54 days). Among the 56 postmenopausal bleeding cases with a provider-attributed etiology, the common causes of bleeding were uterine or cervical lesions (50% [28/56]), hormone replacement therapy (13% [7/56]), and proliferative endometrium (13% [7/56]). Among the 23 cases without a clear etiology, there was no statistically significant clustering of postmenopausal bleeding onset following vaccination.Conclusions:Within this integrated health system, introduction of COVID-19 vaccines was not associated with an increase in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses. Diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding in the 60 days following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination was rare.",0
"IntroductionProteomics technology platforms offer an extremely useful tool for the discovery of new cancer biomarkers. Secreted proteins play important roles in signal transduction, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the molecular signatures of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by quantitative proteomics using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).Material and methodsIn this study, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to analyse the secretome of HCC tissues to identify plasma biomarkers. Serum-free conditioned media (CM) were collected from the primary cultures of cancerous tissues, the surrounding noncancerous tissues, and distal noncancerous tissues.ResultsA proteomic analysis of the CM proteins allowed for a total of 5214 identified proteins, of which 190 and 44 proteins were dysregulated in the HCC tissues/distal noncancerous tissues (HCC/DN group) and the adjacent noncancerous tissues/distal noncancerous tissues (AN/DN group) compared with the distal noncancerous tissues. The dysregulated proteins in the HCC/DN group were concentrated in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling, but the dysregulated proteins in the AN/DN group were more concentrated in the basal material metabolism.ConclusionsThe secretome profile alternations and signalling pathways were associated with HCC incidence and development. The dysregulated proteins in the HCC/DN group were concentrated in the MAPK signalling and JAK-STAT signalling, but the dysregulated proteins in the AN/DN group were more concentrated in the basal material metabolism.","Aging is a complex and universal process marked by gradual functional declines at the cellular and tissue levels, often leading to a range of aging-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Delaying the aging process can help prevent, slow down, and alleviate the severity of these various conditions, enhancing overall health and well-being. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are a class of widely used antidiabetic drugs that inhibit alpha-glucosidase in the small intestinal mucosa, delaying carbohydrate absorption and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. Beyond their roles in diabetes treatment, AGIs have shown potential in extending lifespan and effectively treating aging-related diseases by modulating oxidative stress, gut microbiota, inflammatory responses, and nutrient-sensing pathways. This review summarizes recent advancements in the application of AGIs for preventing and treating aging and aging-related diseases, with a focus on their mechanisms and roles in these processes.",1
"BackgroundThe role of mitophagy in various cancer-associated biological processes is well recognized. Nonetheless, the comprehensive implications of mitophagy in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) necessitate further exploration.MethodsBased on the transcriptomic data encompassing 25 mitophagy-related genes (MRGs), we identified the distinct mitophage patterns in 763 ccRCC samples. Subsequently, a mitophage-related predictive signature with machine learning algorithms was constructed, designated as RiskScore, to quantify the individual mitophagy status in ccRCC patients. Employing multispectral immunofluorescence (mIF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, we detected the effect of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) in the prognosis and immune microenvironment of ccRCC.ResultsOur analysis initially encompassed a comprehensive assessment of the expression profiling, genomic variations, and interactions among the 25 MRGs in ccRCC. Subsequently, the consensus clustering algorithm was applied to stratify ccRCC patients into three clusters with distinct prognostic outcomes, tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics, and underlying biological pathways. We screened eight pivotal genes (CLIC4, PTPRB, SLC16A12, ENPP5, FLRT3, HRH2, PDK4, and SCD5) to construct a mitophagy-related predictive signature, which showed excellent prognostic value for ccRCC patients. Moreover, patient subgroups divided by the RiskScore showed contrasting expression levels of immune checkpoints (ICPs), abundance of immune cells, and immunotherapy response. Additionally, a nomogram was established with robust predictive power integrating the RiskScore and clinical features. Notably, we observed that PINK1 expression markedly correlated with favorable treatment response and advanced maturation stages of tertiary lymphoid structures, which potentially shed light on enhancing anti-tumor immunity of ccRCC.ConclusionCollectively, this study initially developed a signature associated with mitophagy, which demonstrated an excellent ability to predict the clinical prognosis, TME characterization, and responsiveness to targeted therapy and immunotherapy for ccRCC patients. Of particular note is the pivotal role of PINK1 in mediating the treatment response and immune microenvironment for ccRCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05349-y.",AbstractWe present the case of a 59-year-old Chinese man diagnosed with stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma who developed 2 suspicious lung lesions 5 years after follow-up. Pathological evaluation revealed 2 distinct types of cancer: lung adenocarcinoma in situ and clear cell renal carcinoma with lung metastasis. Lung tissue samples were sequenced using a panel of 1267 cancer-related genes. The analysis revealed completely different molecular profiles between the 2 lung lesions and similar clonal mutations in the superior lingular lobe and kidney. This indicates multiple metachronous primary tumors.,1
"Purpose Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC). Switch maintenance therapy after first-line (1L) treatment may delay disease progression. This study evaluated pemetrexed as switch maintenance therapy versus observation in aUC patients without disease progression after initial chemotherapy.Materials and Methods Eligible aUC patients who did not progress after 4-6 cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin-based chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to receive maintenance pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks, up to 16 cycles) or observation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), response rate, and safety.Results The trial was closed early due to slow accrual after avelumab approval. From October 2016 to December 2022, 97 patients were randomized to pemetrexed (n=49) or observation (n=48). The median age was 69 years (range, 43 to 90) and 66 (range, 33 to 82), respectively, with 63% and 73% of patients being male, respectively. The median PFS was 6.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4 to 8.5) with pemetrexed versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.7) with observation (p=0.044; hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.99). The median OS was 18.1 months (95% CI, 6.9 to 29.4) for pemetrexed and 17.9 months (95% CI, 16.1 to 19.7) for observation (p=0.913; HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.73). Common adverse events in the pemetrexed group included anemia (30.6%), fatigue (18.4%), and neutropenia (12.2%), primarily grade 1 or 2.Conclusion The PREMIER trial showed that switch maintenance pemetrexed significantly prolonged PFS in aUC patients post-1L platinum-based chemotherapy, with a favorable safety profile. Further studies on combination maintenance therapies are warranted.","AbstractBACKGROUNDImmunotherapy is an effective personalized treatment for several cancers. Radiogenomics in glioblastoma patients may serve as pre-operative biomarkers of the tumor-host immune apparatus. Validated biomarkers would have the potential to stratify patients during immunotherapy clinical trials, and if trials are beneficial, facilitate personalized neo-adjuvant treatment. The aim of the study is to identify machine learning based radiological biomarkers that can predict immune status within the tumor microenvironment of IDH wildtype glioblastoma. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis is a retrospective multicentre machine learning based study utilizing open access anonymized matched radiogenomic data of TCGA-GBM, CPTAC, Ivy GAP and REMBRANDT datasets. REMBRANDT data acted as a hold out dataset for validation. Imaging data consisted of pre-operative MRI based radiomics features extracted from deep learning based segmented tumours. Transcriptomic data-based overall immune scores and cell-specific (T cells and tumour associated macrophages-TAMS) scores were extracted using CIBERSORTx. Outliers were identified and filtered using principal component analysis. Combat and neuroCombat were utilized for data harmonization of genomic and imaging data respectively. Radiomic feature selection was performed using LASSO technique with cross validation. Support vector machine (SVM) was trained and tested with 80:20 radiomic data split, and binary labels based on  overall immune scores, and  immune cell-specific scores. Data query and analysis was performed using python. RESULTSOne hundred and one patients with 15 in the hold out dataset were included in the study. Trained SVM models predicted the labels for immune score and cell-specific scores (T cells -CD4, CD8; TAMS - M0, M1, M2) with AUC of 0.93, 0.79, 0.86, 0.81, 0.95, 0.76; balanced accuracy of 0.72, 0.82, 0.93, 0.80, 0.86, 0.71 respectively. In the holdout set, the models predicted the labels with robust prediction sensitivity for overall immune scores (100%) and M2 (M2 pro-tumour subtype macrophages) scores (75%) and with robust prediction specificity for T cell scores (CD4: 100%, CD8: 90%) along with M0 (M0 precursor pro-tumour macrophages) (62.5%) and M1 (M1 anti-tumour subtype macrophages) (83%) scores. The radiomic signature employed for prediction models were a group of first order and second order radiomic features obtained after feature selection. CONCLUSIONA radiogenomic SVM model non-invasively predicted immune status in wildtype glioblastoma microenvironment with good accuracy. This model has the potential to be utilized in a prospective glioblastoma clinical trial for immunotherapy.",0
"BackgroundResistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a pervasive barrier in TKIs therapy for EGFR/ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy has exhibited an encouraging anti-tumor activity in high-selected EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to TKI therapy. However, the effect of ICI plus chemotherapy therapy on those with brain metastases in this subset of patients is still unknown.MethodsFrom April 2019 to August 2021, EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who progressed after previous EGFR/ALK-TKIs with brain metastases and received ICI plus chemotherapy ± bevacizumab at Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) were included. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy, toxicity and progression site after ICI treatment.ResultsA total of 19 patients were included in the study, including 16 (84.4%) patients with EGFR mutations, 2 (10.5%) with ALK translocations and 1 (5.3%) with RET rearrangement. All of the patients progressed after previous TKI therapy and had brain metastatic lesions when received ICI combination therapy. The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 15.8 and 57.9%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.7 months (95% confidence interval CI 0.43–8.96) and 19.2 months (95% CI 15.08–23.29), respectively. The intracranial ORR was 10.5% and extracranial ORR was 15.8%, and the intracranial and extracranial DCR were 68.4 and 63.2%, respectively. The most common progression pattern was extracranial failure, and primary lesions enlargement rather than new sites metastases accounted for the vast majority of progressions. The most common grade 3–4 adverse event (AE) was leukopenia (31.6%), followed by neutropenia (26.3%), thrombocytopenia (10.5%) and rash (5.3%) successively. No grade 5 AE and discontinuation of ICI therapy for severe AEs were observed.ConclusionsICI combined with chemotherapy ± bevacizumab might be effective and safe for EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC patients who progressed after previous TKI therapy, and synergistic anti-tumor activity for brain metastases was also observed.","PurposeThe aim of this study was to analyse the correlation of extracranial metastasis sites (ECMs) to the incidence risk of brain metastasis (BMs) in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods18349 newly diagnosed patients were retrospectively analysed, and 4919 pairs of cases were matched by propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio.

"BackgroundG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to have an important role in tumor development and metastasis, and abnormal expression of GPCRs is significantly associated with poor prognosis of tumor patients. In this study, we analyzed the GPCRs-related gene (GPRGs) and tumor microenvironment (TME) in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) to construct a prognostic model to help SKCM patients obtain accurate clinical treatment strategies.MethodsSKCM expression data and clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Differential expression analysis, LASSO algorithm, and univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were used to screen prognosis-related genes (GPR19, GPR146, S1PR2, PTH1R, ADGRE5, CXCR3, GPR143, and OR2I1P) and multiple prognosis-good immune cells; the data set was analyzed according to above results and build up a GPR-TME classifier. The model was further subjected to immune infiltration, functional enrichment, tumor mutational load, immunotherapy prediction, and scRNA-seq data analysis. Finally, cellular experiments were conducted to validate the functionality of the key gene GPR19 in the model.ResultsThe findings indicate that high expression of GPRGs is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with SKCM, highlighting the significant role of GPRGs and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in SKCM development. Notably, the group characterized by low GPR expression and a high TME exhibited the most favorable prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, cellular assays demonstrated that knockdown of GPR19 significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of melanoma cells in A375 and A2058 cell lines.ConclusionThis study provides novel insights for the prognosis evaluation and treatment of melanoma, along with the identification of a new biomarker, GPR19.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05486-4.","The gut microbiota influences the effectiveness and side effects of cancer treatments, particularly immunotherapy and associated immune-related complications. This important involvement of the microbiome is supported by the patients receiving antibiotics responding poorly to immunotherapy. Relatively few research has examined the underlying processes, and until recently, data regarding the detection of the microbial organisms that trigger these effects were inconsistent. Since then, a deeper comprehension of the processes of action and taxonomic classification of the relevant species has been attained. It's been demonstrated that certain bacterial species can enhance the body’s reaction to immune checkpoint inhibitors through the release of distinct metabolites or products. Nonetheless, in certain patients who are not responding, Gram-negative bacteria may have a dominating suppressive impact. Patients' propensity to react to immunotherapy can be somewhat accurately predicted by machine learning techniques based on their microbiome makeup. Consequently, there has been an increase in interest in modifying the microbiome makeup to enhance patient reaction to medication. Clinical proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that dietary modifications or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might be used therapeutically to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients. Current developments and new approaches for microbiota-based cancer treatments have been emphasized. In conclusion, preclinical research on animals and human clinical trials has made tremendous progress in our understanding of the function of the gut microbiome in health and illness. These investigations have shed light on the effects of food, FMT, probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiome-disease connections. However, there are still a lot of issues and restrictions that must be resolved before this research can be used in real-world clinical settings.Graphical Abstract",0
"Background and purpose:Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating stroke, in which acidosis is one of detrimental complications. The extracellular pH reduction can activate G protein-coupled receptor 4 (GPR4) in the brain. Yet, the extent to which proton-activated GPR4 contributes to the early brain injury (EBI) post-SAH remains largely unexplored. Ferroptosis, iron-dependent programmed cell death, has recently been shown to contribute to EBI. We aimed to investigate the effects of GPR4 inhibition on neurological deficits and neuronal ferroptosis after SAH in rats.Methods:A total 253 Sprague Dawley (SD) male rats (weighing 275–330g) were utilized in this study. SAH was induced by endovascular perforation. NE-52-QQ57 (NE), a selective antagonist of GPR4 was administered intraperitoneally 1-h post-SAH. To explore the mechanisms, RhoA activator U-46619 and YAP activator PY-60 were delivered intracerebroventricularly. Short- and long-term neurobehavior, SAH grading, Western blot assay, ELISA assay, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy was performed post-SAH.Results:Following SAH, there was an upregulation of GPR4 expression in neurons. GPR4 inhibition by NE improved both short-term and long-term neurological outcomes post-SAH. NE also reduced neuronal ferroptosis, as evidenced by decreased lipid peroxidation products 4HNE and MDA levels in brain tissues, and reduced mitochondrial shrinkage, increased mitochondria crista and decreased membrane density. The application of either U-46619 or PY-60 partially offset the neuroprotective effects of NE on neuronal ferroptosis in SAH rats.Conclusions:This study demonstrated that acid-sensing receptor GPR4 contributed to neuronal ferroptosis after SAH via RhoA/YAP pathway, and NE may be a potential therapeutic strategy to attenuate GPR4 mediated neuronal ferroptosis and EBI after SAH.","Aim: Breast cancer is the most recurring cancer among females and is being diagnosed as a major cause of death among women.Materials & methods: Levosulpiride Schiff base derivatives were synthesized and analyzed by physical and spectral (FTIR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR) analysis.

"BackgroundThe CD-TK double suicide gene has become an effective therapy for bladder cancer. A novel molecular-targeted ultrasound (US) method has been developed to precisely guide nanobubbles loaded with this gene to regions within bladder tumor cells and is widely used due to its efficiency in delivering drugs to the target tumor.MethodsUniform nanoscaled nanobubbles loaded with CD-TK double suicide gene were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods.ResultsIn the present study, we synthesized CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded cationic nanobubbles conjugated with anti-VEGFR2 that can bind with VEGFR2-positive cells. Fluorescence and flow cytometry evidence show that CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded nanobubbles were successfully developed. CD-TK-CNBs delivered via US-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) enhanced transfection efficiency, overexpression of CD-TK double suicide gene, and tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro.ConclusionsThese CD-TK-CNBs may become a novel treatment for bladder cancer.","BackgroundDisulfidptosis, as a new mode of programmed cell death, is closely associated with tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, M2 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) plays an important role in tumor progression. Here, we propose to combine these two perspectives to detect novel disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related biomarkers in bladder cancer (BCa) to identify various tumor subtypes, construct prognostic features, reveal immune and somatic mutational landscapes, and screen for drugs in BCa.MethodsWe used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to mine M2 TAM-related genes. Consensus unsupervised clustering was performed to identify potential tumor subtypes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to build the risk model. We then explored the immune cell, immune function, immune checkpoint expression patterns and somatic mutational landscape in clusters and risk groups. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis for anti-cancer drugs.ResultsWe identified 3057 M2 TAM-related genes and intersected them with disulfidptosis-related genes to obtain 95 disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related genes (DMRGs). In terms of tumor subtypes, two molecular clusters were identified. Cluster 1 showed stronger immunogenicity and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). We also predicted 50 drugs with high sensitivity in cluster 1. On the basis of risk grouping, the high-risk group had poor overall survival in the training, test, and validation groups. Ten screened anti-cancer drugs were more sensitive in the high-risk group. A nomogram predicting survival of BCa patients was also established.ConclusionBy combining two hotspot perspectives, disulfidptosis and M2 TAM, we provide a valuable risk score signature for establishing individualized treatment regimens and drug choices. The risk score may serve as an independent risk factor for BCa patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05352-3.",1
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that has no therapeutic targets, relies on chemotherapeutics for treatment, and is in dire need of novel therapeutic approaches for improved patient outcomes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as intercellular communicators and have been proposed as ideal drug delivery vehicles. Here, EVs were engineered with RNA nanotechnology to develop TNBC tumor inhibitors. Using super resolved-structured illumination microscopy, EVs were optimized for precise Survivin small interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugated to chemotherapeutics loading and CD44 aptamer ligand decoration, thereby enhancing specificity toward TNBC cells. Conventional treatments typically employ chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine (GEM) and paclitaxel (PTX) at dosages on the order of mg/kg respectively, per injection (intravenous) in mice. In contrast, engineered EVs encapsulating these drugs saw functional tumor growth inhibition at significantly reduced concentrations: 2.2 μg/kg for GEM or 5.6 μg/kg for PTX, in combination with 21.5 μg/kg survivin-siRNA in mice. The result is a substantial decrease in the chemotherapeutic dose required, by orders of magnitude, compared with standard regimens. In vivo and in vitro evaluations in a TNBC orthotopic xenograft mouse model demonstrated the efficacy of this decreased dosage strategy, indicating the potential for decreased chemotherapy-associated toxicity.","AbstractNecroptosis, a cell death mechanism with the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. Induction of necroptosis for cancer therapy may be possible through the regulation of the expression of a key factor gene receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3 (RIPK3) via in vitro transcription (IVT) mRNA delivery. However, mRNA is susceptible to degradation and has a low delivery efficiency, which highlights the requirement of a proper delivery vehicle for intracellular delivery. Therefore, a new mRNA delivery system based on the nanostructured silica nanoparticles, termed mRNA‐protective nanocage (mPN) has been developed. High‐efficiency expression of RIPK3 and induction of necroptosis is achieved through delivery of RIPK3 IVT mRNA with mPN in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, the mPN carrying RIPK3 mRNA distributed locally in tumors upon intravascular injection, and successfully induced necroptosis and immune cell infiltration, a hallmark of necroptosis. the suppression of tumor growth in a murine cancer model, demonstrating the synergistic effect of RIPK3 mRNA‐ and immune cell‐mediated therapy is also observed. These findings suggest the potential for anticancer therapy through necroptosis induction and provide a strategy for the development of mRNA‐based nanomedicine.",1
"AbstractThe clinical approval of platinum‐based drugs has prompted the development of novel metallo‐complexes during the last several decades, while severe problems, especially for poor water solubility, drug resistance and toxicity in patients, greatly hindered the clinical trials and curative efficacy. To address these issues, the concept of metallo‐prodrugs has been proposed for oncology. Some stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs provide new insights for designing and preparing site‐specific prodrugs with maximized therapeutic efficacy and negligible unfavorable by‐effects. In this review, recent progress in stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs in the past 20 years has been overviewed, where endogenous and exogenous stimuli have been involved. Typical examples of smart stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs are discussed regarding to their molecular structure, activation mechanism, and promising biomedical applications. In the end, challenges and future perspectives in metallo‐prodrugs have been discussed.","Frizzled receptors (FZDs) are key contributors intrinsic to the Wnt signaling pathway, activation of FZDs triggering the Wnt signaling cascade is frequently observed in human tumors and intimately associated with an aggressive carcinoma phenotype. It has been shown that the abnormal expression of FZD receptors contributes to the manifestation of malignant characteristics in human tumors such as enhanced cell proliferation, metastasis, chemotherapy resistance as well as the acquisition of cancer stemness. Given the essential roles of FZD receptors in the Wnt signaling in human tumors, this review aims to consolidate the prevailing knowledge on the specific status of FZD receptors (FZD1–10) and elucidate their respective functions in tumor progression. Furthermore, we delineate the structural basis for binding of FZD and its co-receptors to Wnt, and provide a better theoretical foundation for subsequent studies on related mechanisms. Finally, we describe the existing biological classes of small molecule-based FZD inhibitors in detail in the hope that they can provide useful assistance for design and development of novel drug candidates targeted FZDs.",1
"Background and aimsLiver fibrosis (LF) is the common pathological process of almost all liver diseases, but the pathogenesis is extremely complicated and has not been fully clarified. Therefore, we want to explore LF’s complex pathogenesis and identify key genetic markers that can predict LF prognosis.MethodsFrom Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,  we contained datasets GSE84044 and GSE130970. And involved GSE15654 whose survival data were for the validation of our model’s prognostic value. Then, Bulk RNA sequencing was used to establish a LF-related prognostic model and to determine key genes.The key genes were later analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and the role of macrophages in LF was investigated.ResultsWe established a comprehensive LF-related prognostic model (FMSig, that is, fibrosis macrophage-related prognostic signature) containing four genes (IER3, AKR1B10, ADCY1, and PGM1). FMSig can distinguish between survival outcomes in dataset GSE15654. IER3 showed a higher hazard ratio than the other three FMSig genes. Moreover, further scRNA-seq analysis showed that IER3 is highly expressed in myeloid cells while the other three genes were rarely expressed in six immune cell types and other cell clusters. After reclustering the myeloid cells into seven clusters, we found that IER3 was highly expressed in myeloid cell cluster 3, shown to be related to anti-inflammation and lipid metabolism functions. Based on pseudotime analysis, we suggest that myeloid cell type 3 is transformed from myeloid cell type 0 in the liver cirrhosis microenvironment. On immunohistochemical staining, LF showed significantly higher IER3 expression than healthy controls.ConclusionThis study established a predictive model, FMSig, to evaluate LF prognosis, and showed that IER3 and macrophages are related to LF.","PurposeThe potential role of epithelium-specific genes through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown. Therefore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing data to select diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for CRC.MethodsThe CRC scRNA-seq dataset was used to describe the cellular landscape of normal intestinal mucosa, adenoma and CRC and to further select epithelium-specific clusters. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of epithelium-specific clusters were identified between intestinal lesion and normal mucosa in the scRNA-seq data throughout the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Diagnostic biomarkers and prognostic biomarker (the risk score) for CRC were selected in the bulk RNA-seq dataset based on DEGs shared by the adenoma epithelium-specific cluster and the CRC epithelium-specific cluster (shared-DEGs).ResultsAmong the 1063 shared-DEGs, we selected 38 gene expression biomarkers and 3 methylation biomarkers that had promising diagnostic power in plasma. Multivariate Cox regression identified 174 shared-DEGs as prognostic genes for CRC. We combined 1000 times LASSO-Cox regression and two-way stepwise regression to select 10 prognostic shared-DEGs to construct the risk score in the CRC meta-dataset. In the external validation dataset, the 1- and 5-year AUCs of the risk score were higher than those of stage, the pyroptosis-related genes (PRG) score and the cuproptosis-related genes (CRG) score. In addition, the risk score was closely associated with the immune infiltration of CRC.ConclusionThe combined analysis of the scRNA-seq dataset and the bulk RNA-seq dataset in this study provides reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of CRC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04882-0.",1
"BackgroundLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens people’s health worldwide. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in regulating LUAD growth and metastasis as well as in therapeutic response. However, currently, there is a lack of integrative analysis of PCD-related signatures of LUAD for accurate prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response.MethodsThe bulk transcriptome and clinical information of LUAD were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. A total of 1382 genes involved in regulating 13 various PCD patterns (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, netotic cell death, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, parthanatos, autophagy-dependent cell death, oxeiptosis, alkaliptosis and disulfidptosis) were included in the study. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were performed to identify PCD-associated differential expression genes (DEGs). An unsupervised consensus clustering algorithm was used to explore the potential subtypes of LUAD based on the expression profiles of PCD-associated DEGs. Univariate Cox regression analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, Random Forest (RF) analysis and stepwise multivariate Cox analysis were performed to construct a prognostic gene signature. The “oncoPredict” algorithm was utilized for drug-sensitive analysis. GSVA and GSEA were utilized to perform function enrichment analysis. MCPcounter, quanTIseq, Xcell and ssGSEA algorithms were used for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. A nomogram incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics was established to predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.ResultsForty PCD-associated DEGs related to LUAD were obtained by WGCNA analysis and differential expression analysis, followed by unsupervised clustering to identify two LUAD molecular subtypes. A programmed cell death index (PCDI) with a five-gene signature was established by machine learning algorithms. LUAD patients were then divided into a high PCDI group and a low PCDI group using the median PCDI as a cutoff. Survival and therapeutic analysis revealed that the high PCDI group had a poor prognosis and was more sensitive to targeted drugs but less sensitive to immunotherapy compared to the low PCDI group. Further enrichment analysis showed that B cell-related pathways were significantly downregulated in the high PCDI group. Accordingly, the decreased tumor immune cell infiltration and the lower tumor tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) scores were also found in the high PCDI group. Finally, a nomogram with reliable predictive performance PCDI was constructed by incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics, and a user-friendly online website was established for clinical reference ( performed the first comprehensive analysis of the clinical relevance of genes regulating 13 PCD patterns in LUAD and identified two LUAD molecular subtypes with distinct PCD-related gene signature which indicated differential prognosis and treatment sensitivity. Our study provided a new index to predict the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and the prognosis of LUAD patients for guiding personalized treatments.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05000-w.","BackgroundDNA-directed RNA polymerase (DDRP) related genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the development of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Therefore, we aimed to construct a DDRP-associated lncRNA model to predict the prognosis of LUAD and to evaluate its sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy.MethodsTo construct a predictive signature, we used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, as well as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. The prognostic model was verified by applying the ROC curve analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis, GO/KEGG analysis, and a predictive nomogram. Eventually, immunotherapy and drug susceptibility were examined and stemness indices were analyzed.Results24 DDRP-associated lncRNAs were found as independent prognosis factors, which may be further developed as potential therapeutic vaccines for LUAD. The area under the ROC curve and the conformance index showed that the constructed model can predict the prognosis of LUAD patients. The predicted incidences of overall survival showed perfect conformance. And there were significant changes in immunological markers between the two risk subgroups in the model. Finally, an analysis of 50% maximum inhibitory concentration between the two risk subgroups showed that the high-risk subgroup was more sensitive to certain chemotherapy drugs.ConclusionWe constructed a model that accurately predicts the outcomes of LUAD based on 24 DDRP-related lncRNAs and provided promising treatment options for the future.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05118-x.",1
"PurposePolypharmacy is a common problem among older adults. However, its prevalence and impact on the clinical outcomes of anticancer treatment, such as survival and adverse events, in older patients with advanced cancer have not been well investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from Japanese patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 2016 and 2019.ResultsAmong 157 older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients, the prevalence of polypharmacy, defined as ≥ 5 medications, was 59.9% (94/157). The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use, according to the screening tool of older people’s prescription (STOPP) criteria version 2, was 38.2% (60/157). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 3.7 and 5.5 months, respectively (P = 0.0017). The median overall survival (OS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 9.5 and 28.1 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between polypharmacy and OS, but no significant associations between polypharmacy and PFS. Polypharmacy was not associated with immune-related adverse events but was associated with higher rate of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment (59.6% vs. 31.7%, P < 0.001).ConclusionPolypharmacy is an independent prognostic factor in older patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI. Also, polypharmacy could be utilized as a simple indicator of patients’ comorbidities and symptoms or as a predictive marker of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03252-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundCheckpoint inhibitors (CKI) targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 are major therapies for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite numerous studies of biological biomarkers, we currently lack a marker to predict CKI primary resistance. The aim of this study was to isolate clinical markers associated with the absence of efficacy of CKI used as monotherapy in NSCLC.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 172 patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for advanced NSCLC at the Dijon Cancer Center. Baseline characteristics were compared using the Chi squared test between responders and non-responders. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test for univariate analysis. Cox regression models were used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).ResultsAmong 172 patients included, 149 (86.5%) received CKI after platinum chemotherapy. Response rate (RR) was 16%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 months (95% CI 0.7–30 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95% CI 0.7–46.8 months). By univariate analysis, WHO performance status ≥ 1, presence of bone, liver and pleuroperitoneal metastasis were associated with poor PFS and OS. Multivariate analysis showed that only pleuroperitoneal metastasis was independently associated with PFS and OS. Patients with pleuroperitoneal metastasis and WHO performance status ≥ 1 had a < 10% chance of yielding a benefit from CKI.ConclusionsOur data support the hypothesis that pleuroperitoneal metastasis is a major predictive factor affecting CKI efficacy in NSCLC patients and may be used to avoid CKI monotherapy for such patients.",1
"BackgroundNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a crucial treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC. However, only a subset of patients experience clinical benefit from ICIs. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that can predict response to ICIs is imperative for optimising patient selection.MethodsHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images of NSCLC patients were obtained from the local cohort (n = 106) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 899). We developed an ICI-related pathological prognostic signature (ir-PPS) based on H&E stained histopathology images to predict prognosis in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs using deep learning. To accomplish this, we employed a modified ResNet model (ResNet18-PG), a widely-used deep learning architecture well-known for its effectiveness in handling complex image recognition tasks. Our modifications include a progressive growing strategy to improve the stability of model training and the use of the AdamW optimiser, which enhances the optimisation process by adjusting the learning rate based on training dynamics.ResultsThe deep learning model, ResNet18-PG, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.918 and a recall of 0.995 on the local cohort. The ir-PPS effectively risk-stratified NSCLC patients. Patients in the low-risk group (n = 40) had significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) after ICI treatment compared to those in the high-risk group (n = 66, log-rank P = 0.004, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.65, 95%CI: 1.75–7.60). The ir-PPS demonstrated good discriminatory power for predicting 6-month PFS (AUC = 0.750), 12-month PFS (AUC = 0.677), and 18-month PFS (AUC = 0.662). The low-risk group exhibited increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules, cytotoxicity-related genes, an elevated abundance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, and enhanced activity in immune stimulatory pathways.ConclusionsThe ir-PPS signature derived from H&E images using deep learning could predict ICIs prognosis in NSCLC patients. The ir-PPS provides a novel imaging biomarker that may help select optimal candidates for ICIs therapy in NSCLC.","Ferroptosis and immune response correlation studies have not been reported in prostate cancer (PCa), and the main goal of this paper is to identify biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Data on PCa were retrieved from the TCGA and MSKCC2010 databases. Thereafter, the differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DE-FRGs: ACSF2) and immune-related genes (DE-IRGs: ANGPT1, NPPC, and PTGDS) were identified using the “limma” package. Additionally, we used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to obtain biochemical relapse (BCR)-free survival-related genes and construct a risk signature. Patients with high-risk scores were characterized by poor BCR-free survival, relatively low immune cell abundance, and comparably weak expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Moreover, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was performed to explore the biological pathways related to the risk signature. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGESA) was applied to evaluate the status of immune cells in patients with PCa, which demonstrated that the risk score was intimately affiliated with immune response and cancer pathways. Ultimately, the connection between the risk score and response of PCa patients to immunotherapy was appraised using the TIDE algorithm. The TIDE algorithm implied that the high-risk score PCa population might benefit more from immunotherapy regimens. Finally, qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the expression of DE-FRGs and DE-IRGs in PCa cell and normal prostate epithelial cells. The result of qRT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of ACSF2, ANGPT1, NPPC, and PTGDS in normal prostate epithelial cell were higher than that in PCa cells. Therefore, a risk score model was generated based on one DE-FRG and three DE-IRGs, which could predict the BCR-free survival and response of immunotherapy for patients with PCa.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12033-024-01293-5.",1
"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the role of LINC00513 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression.Materials & methods: Cell proliferation was evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell migration was detected with transwell assay. RNA pull-down was applied for verifying the interactions between LINC00513, IGF2BP1 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF).Results: LINC00513, IGF2BP1 and CTGF levels were upregulated in CRC. Knockdown of LINC00513 significantly inhibited the malignant behavior of CRC cells. LINC00513 increased CTGF mRNA stability by binding with IGF2BP1.

The intestinal microbiota has been called the ""neglected organ"" and there is growing evidence that the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites can be used in combination with immunotherapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy to greatly enhance the treatment of colorectal cancer and to address some of the side effects and adverse effects of these therapies. Antibiotics have great potential to eliminate harmful microbiota, control infection, and reduce colorectal cancer side effects. However, the use of antibiotics has been a highly controversial issue, and numerous retrospective studies have shown that the use of antibiotics affects the effectiveness of treatment (especially immunotherapy). Understanding the bi-directional role of the gut microbiota and antibiotics will further enhance our research into the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.MethodsWe searched the ""PubMed"" database and selected the following keywords ""intestinal microbiota, antibiotics, treatment, prevention, colorectal cancer"". In this review, we discuss the role of the intestinal microbiota in immunotherapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, diagnosis, and prevention of CRC. We also conclude that the intestinal microbiota and antibiotics work together to promote the treatment of CRC through a bidirectional effect.ResultsWe found that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role in promoting immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, diagnosis and prevention of CRC. In addition, gut microbiota and antibiotic interactions could be a new strategy for CRC treatment.ConclusionThe bi-directional role of the intestinal microbiota and antibiotics plays a key role in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of colorectal cancer.",1
"BackgroundAlthough targeted therapies and immunotherapy have achieved significant clinical benefits in patients with certain pathological types of lung cancer. However, prognosis for patients with lung adenocarcinoma still remains unsatisfactory. It is of extremely importance to find ideal prognostic indicators to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients, especially for patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the significance of Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1) and Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.MethodsIn this study, IGFR1 and VEGF-A expression on 119 specimens of patients early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed by immunohistochemistry with an H-score system.ResultsBoth high IGFR1 expression and VEGF-A expression patients were resulted in 59 (49.6%) separately. The numbers and proportions of IGFR1−&VEGF-A− subgroup, IGFR1−&VEGF-A+ subgroup, IGFR1+&VEGF-A− subgroup and IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ subgroup are 23 (19.3%), 37 (31.1%), 37 (31.1%) and 22 (18.5%) respectively. High IGFR1 expression was significantly associated with both poor PFS and OS of all patients in a univariate analysis. Multivariable analysis showed that patients with IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ expression exhibited a worst PFS and OS in the subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutation.ConclusionsThese results suggest that IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ is expected to be a disadvantageous factor for prognosis in the subgroup of EGFR mutation in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. What’s more, this study may provide the theoretical possibility to screen optimal population for a combination therapy with anti-VEGF and anti-IGFR1 in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05371-0.","Background and aimsSecond primary prostate cancer (SPPCa) is a common type of secondary malignancy that negatively impacts patient prognosis. This study aimed to identify prognostic factors for SPPCa patients and develop nomograms to assess their prognosis.MethodsPatients diagnosed with SPPCa between 2010 and 2015 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The study cohort was randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan‒Meier survival analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis were used to identify independent prognostic factors and develop the nomogram. The nomograms were evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, area under the curve (AUC), and Kaplan–Meier analysis.ResultsA total of 5342 SPPCa patients were included in the study. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were identified as age, interval between diagnoses, first primary tumor site, and AJCC stage, N stage, M stage, PSA, Gleason score, and SPPCa surgery. Nomograms were constructed based on these prognostic factors, and the performance was evaluated using the C-index (OS: 0.733, CSS: 0.838), AUC, calibration curve, and Kaplan–Meier analysis, which demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy.ConclusionWe successfully established and validated nomograms to predict OS and CSS in SPPCa patients using the SEER database. These nomograms provide an effective tool for risk stratification and prognosis assessment in SPPCa patients, which will aid clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies for this patient population.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05086-2.",1
"Cancer immunotherapy is a major breakthrough in tumor therapy and has been used in monotherapy or combination therapy. However, it has been associated with poor immune tolerance in some patients or immune-related adverse events. Therefore, ideal and reliable tumor elimination strategies are urgently needed to overcome these shortcomings. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a negatively charged phospholipid, usually present in the inner lobules of eukaryotic cell membranes. Under certain physiological or pathological conditions, PS may be exposed on the outer leaflets of apoptotic cells serving as recognition signals by phagocytes and modulating the immune response. On the contrary, increased exposure of PS in the tumor microenvironment can significantly antagonize the body’s anti-tumor immunity, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis. During radiotherapy and chemotherapy, PS-mediated immunosuppression increases the PS levels in necrotic tissue in the tumor microenvironment, further suppressing tumor immunity. PS-targeted therapy is a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy. It inhibits tumor growth and improves the anti-tumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of PS-targeted therapy opens up a new perspective for future cancer immunotherapies.","Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is a salivary gland malignancy most commonly arising in the parotid gland.

"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The introduction of biologics, particularly anti-interleukin (IL) agents, has revolutionized IBD treatment. This review summarizes the role of ILs in IBD pathophysiology and describes the efficacy and positioning of anti-IL therapies. We discuss the functions of key ILs in IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets. The review then discusses anti-IL therapies, focusing primarily on ustekinumab (anti-IL-12/23), risankizumab (anti-IL-23), and mirikizumab (anti-IL-23). Clinical trial data demonstrate their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The safety profiles of these agents are generally favorable. However, long-term safety data for newer agents are still limited. The review also briefly discusses emerging therapies such as guselkumab and brazikumab. Network meta-analyses suggest that anti-IL therapies perform well compared to other biological agents. These agents may be considered first- or second-line therapies for many patients, especially those with comorbidities or safety concerns. Anti-IL therapies represent a significant advancement in IBD treatment, offering effective and relatively safe options for patients with moderate to severe disease.","Colorectal cancer is one of the malignant tumors that pose a serious threat to human health.

With the development of precision therapy, the advent of molecularly targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors has improved the outcome of intermediate to advanced colorectal cancer. However, the duration of drug benefit is usually short, and overall survival and progression-free survival remain suboptimal. Therefore, investigators are exploring more rational, safe, and effective drug combination regimens through clinical trials to provide longer survival for patients with such genetic mutations with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This article reviews the progress of clinical research on molecularly targeted drugs, immune checkpoint inhibitors, first-line chemotherapeutic agents, and different combination therapy regimens (including different targeted drug combinations, immune combination targeting, and chemotherapy combination targeting) for colorectal cancer patients with BRAF V600E mutation, which provides a reference for further in-depth clinical exploration of the treatment of colorectal cancer patients with BRAF V600E mutation.",1
"AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.","Circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary strategy in cancer immunotherapy, facilitating novel approaches to induce robust and durable immune responses. Unlike traditional linear messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development. This review delved into the fundamental principles underlying circRNA biology, highlighting their unique structural advantages and translational potential. We examined recent advancements in circRNA vaccine design, focusing on their application in oncology. As the circRNA-based cancer vaccine is a relatively novel technology, findings from all the major studies describing its efficacy were discussed.

"BackgroundThyroid carcinoma (THCA) is a common type of cancer worldwide, and its incidence has been increasing in recent years. Disulfidptosis, a recently defined form of metabolic-related regulated cell death (RCD), has been shown to play a sophisticated role in antitumor immunity. However, its mechanisms and functions are still poorly understood and the association between disulfidptosis and the prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma remains to be elucidated. This study aims to investigate the connection between disulfidptosis and the prognosis of thyroid cancer, while also developing a prognostic index based on disulfidptosis genes.Materials and methodsWe utilized 24 genes associated with disulfidptosis to create the classification and model. To gather data, we sourced gene expression profiles, somatic mutation information, copy number variation data, and corresponding clinical data from the TCGA database for patients with thyroid cancer. Additionally, we obtained single-cell transcriptome data GSE184362 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for further analysis.ResultsIn this study, we utilized 24 genes associated with disulfidptosis to identify two distinct groups with different biological processes using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Our findings showed that Cluster 1 is associated with chemokines, interleukins, interferons, checkpoint genes, and other important components of the immune microenvironment. Moreover, cluster 1 patients with high IPS scores may be more sensitive to immunotherapy. We also provide drug therapeutic strategies for each cluster patients based on the IC50 of each drug. The Enet model was chosen as the optimal model with the highest C-index and showed that patients with high risk had a worse prognosis and weak cell-to-cell interactions in THCA. Finally, we established a nomogram model based on multivariable cox and logistic regression analyses to predict the overall survival of THCA patients.ConclusionThis research provides new insight into the impact of disulfidptosis on THCA. Through a thorough examination of disulfidptosis, a new classification system has been developed that can effectively predict the clinical prognosis and drug sensitivity of THCA patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05006-4.","AbstractProtein kinases play a key role in cellular signaling pathways including proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and immune regulation. Therefore, targeting kinases with small molecules has emerged as a therapeutic potential in cancers and other diseases including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The main chemical motifs of the available small molecule kinase inhibitors are heterocyclic, nitrogen-containing and six-membered rings including pyrazine. Several potent and selective pyrazine-based kinase inhibitors have been developed and progressed into clinical trials. The data of clinical application of kinase inhibitors demonstrate good clinical activity with manageable toxicity in several relapse-resistant malignancies and severe to moderate immunological disorders. All pyrazine-based kinase inhibitors are orally active. This paper reviews the most recent kinase literature (2019–2023) related to pyrazine-based small molecule inhibitors. This review includes the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved and patent agents along with their targeted kinase, scaffold, potency, selectivity profile, assignee and biological results in clinical and preclinical studies.",0
"AbstractBackground:Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery has been a common practice for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, but the response rate varies among patients. This study aimed to develop a ResNet-Vision Transformer based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-endoscopy fusion model to precisely predict treatment response and provide personalized treatment.Methods:In this multicenter study, 366 eligible patients who had undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery at eight Chinese tertiary hospitals between January 2017 and June 2024 were recruited, with 2928 pretreatment colonic endoscopic images and 366 pelvic MRI images. An MRI-endoscopy fusion model was constructed based on the ResNet backbone and Transformer network using pretreatment MRI and endoscopic images. Treatment response was defined as good response or non-good response based on the tumor regression grade. The Delong test and the Hanley–McNeil test were utilized to compare prediction performance among different models and different subgroups, respectively. The predictive performance of the MRI-endoscopy fusion model was comprehensively validated in the test sets and was further compared to that of the single-modal MRI model and single-modal endoscopy model.Results:The MRI-endoscopy fusion model demonstrated favorable prediction performance. In the internal validation set, the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy were 0.852 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.744–0.940) and 0.737 (95% CI: 0.712–0.844), respectively. Moreover, the AUC and accuracy reached 0.769 (95% CI: 0.678–0.861) and 0.729 (95% CI: 0.628–0.821), respectively, in the external test set. In addition, the MRI-endoscopy fusion model outperformed the single-modal MRI model (AUC: 0.692 [95% CI: 0.609–0.783], accuracy: 0.659 [95% CI: 0.565–0.775]) and the single-modal endoscopy model (AUC: 0.720 [95% CI: 0.617–0.823], accuracy: 0.713 [95% CI: 0.612–0.809]) in the external test set.Conclusion:The MRI-endoscopy fusion model based on ResNet-Vision Transformer achieved favorable performance in predicting treatment response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and holds tremendous potential for enabling personalized treatment regimens for locally advanced rectal cancer patients.","BackgroundCutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) has the worst prognosis among skin cancers, especially metastatic CMM. Predicting its prognosis accurately could direct clinical decisions.MethodsThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was screened to collect CMM patients’ data. According to diagnosed time, patients were subdivided into three cohorts, train cohort (diagnosed between 2010 and 2013), validation cohort (diagnosed in 2014), and test cohort (diagnosed in 2015). Train cohort was used to train deep learning survival model for cutaneous malignant melanoma (DeepCMM). DeepCMM was then evaluated in train cohort and validation cohort internally, and validated in test cohort externally.ResultsDeepCMM showed 0.8270 (95% CI, confidence interval, CI 0.8260–0.8280) as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in train cohort, 0.8274 (95% CI 0.8286–0.8298) AUC in validation cohort, and 0.8303 (95% CI 0.8289–0.8316) AUC in test cohort. Then DeepCMM was packaged into a Windows 64-bit software for doctors to use.ConclusionDeep learning survival model for cutaneous malignant melanoma (DeepCMM) can offer a reliable prediction on cutaneous malignant melanoma patients’ overall survival.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05421-7.",1
"No studies have examined the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and HPV-18 on survival, inflammation biomarkers, and immune function in early-stage cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery. Patients diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer were screened for high-risk HPV prior to surgery. The influence of HPV infection on survival, inflammatory markers, and immune function was investigated. Findings revealed that patients in the HPV-18 positive subgroup exhibited poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and elevated levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, along with decreased CD4+ T cells compared to patients who tested negative for HPV-18. Notably, early-stage cervical cancer patients with HPV-18 infection experienced worse DFS, heightened inflammatory markers, and compromised immune function.","ObjectiveGanoderic acid A can inhibit the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells. Surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of ganoderic acid A still remain poorly defined. Ganoderic acid A derivative (GaAD19) is an effective ingredient obtained by structural modification of ganoderic acid A. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-proliferation effect of GaAD19 on cervical cancer cells.MethodsThrough the HeLa cervical cancer cell model, the drug target of GaAD19 was predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database and molecular docking. Subsequently, computer analysis results were verified by a series of molecular biology experiments, such as flow cytometry, Western blot, immunocytochemical staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and so on. Then, pathway agonists and inhibitors were used to investigate the mechanism of GaAD19. Finally, the mouse model of cervical cancer was established to evaluate the inhibitory effect of GaAD19 on tumor growth in U14 cervical cancer mice.ResultsGaAD19 induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of tumors. It also blocked the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. However, in the presence of a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)agonist, the effects of GaAD19 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle transition of cancer cells were suppressed.ConclusionThis study showed that GaAD19 can play an anti-cervical cancer role by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway. These results will be helpful in further exploring the mechanism of GaAD19 in the treatment of cervical cancer.",1

This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer, focusing on its differential expression patterns, prognostic implications, genetic alterations, and associations with the tumor microenvironment.Methods and resultsUsing large-scale datasets, including GTEx, TCGA, HPA, and cBioPortal, we analyzed FKBP1A expression across normal tissues and various cancer types. Our findings revealed that FKBP1A exhibited aberrant upregulation in most human cancers, making it a potential biomarker for malignancy. Moreover, FKBP1A expression correlated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, disease-free interval, and progression-free interval in several cancers, indicating its prognostic significance. Genetic alteration analysis showed that FKBP1A gene amplification was prevalent, particularly in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, FKBP1A expression was associated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, highlighting its potential involvement in tumor-immune response. Notably, FKBP1A expression positively correlated with stromal and immune cell scores, suggesting its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, according to the functional enrichment analysis, experimental validation in lung adenocarcinoma confirmed the role of FKBP1A through the regulation of EGFR signaling by apoptosis, which is consistent with drug sensitivity analysis to some extent.ConclusionIn conclusion, FKBP1A exhibits differential expression in cancer, serves as a prognostic indicator, undergoes genetic alterations, and influences the tumor-immune microenvironment. These findings shed light on the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer development and progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and guidance of clinical drugs selection, and provide valuable insights into patient prognosis for interventions based on pharmaceuticals.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05362-1.",1
"AbstractMicrosatellite instability (MSI) is an important biomarker in cancer. While routine methods can detect MSI in certain tumor types, in other tumor types the results may be incorrect due to differences in the MSI loci pattern. Here, we report the case of a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with confirmed MSI by two independent next-generation sequencing tests, but not by routine methods, who had progression on pembrolizumab. Comparison of the patient’s MSI loci patterns with MSI+ colorectal adenocarcinoma samples showed a lower fraction of unstable loci, low resolution of a second peak in the repeat length spectrum of unstable short tandem repeats in the patient's sample, and a lower length of indels (3.7 vs 4.5 base pairs, p < 0.01).","We present an unusual case of uveitis secondary to avelumab and pembrolizumab in a 39-year-old Taiwanese male with stage IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and lung metastasis, who initially received pembrolizumab as his primary treatment. However, the patient experienced skin and liver immune-related adverse events (irAEs) after the seventh dose of pembrolizumab, which prompted a switch to avelumab. The patient began to experience gradual blurring of vision after completing the fifth cycle of avelumab immunotherapy. Ophthalmic examinations revealed findings consistent with bilateral anterior uveitis. Despite an initial lack of significant improvement with steroid treatment, the patient’s vision and inflammation improved upon discontinuation of avelumab. Due to the occurrence of uveitis, avelumab was switched back to pembrolizumab. However, three months after initiating pembrolizumab, the patient developed foggy vision and bilateral anterior uveitis with cystoid macular edema (CME). The administration of topical, oral, and subconjunctival steroids resulted in an improvement in vision and the resolution of CME, without the need to discontinue pembrolizumab. Over the subsequent eighteen months, there has been no recurrence of uveitis, and there is no evidence of relapse or further metastasis in his ccRCC.",1
"BackgroundDespite advances in precision medicine for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), biomarker testing for these therapies remains frequently underused, delayed, and inequitable. Pulmonologists often play a critical role in the initial diagnostic steps for patients with lung cancer, and previous data show variability in their knowledge and practices regarding biomarker testing. The purpose of this study is to better understand how pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care.Research QuestionWith the increasing importance of biomarker testing and precision medicine, how do pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care?Study DesignAn electronic survey consisting of 31 items focused on attitudes and practices regarding diagnostic steps for NSCLC was randomly distributed to a sample of practicing pulmonologists in the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) analytics database. Inferential statistics were performed using χ2 tests and multivariable logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 401 pulmonologists responded to the survey. Most (92%) were general pulmonologists, and more than one-half (62%) indicated they order biomarker testing. Longer practice tenure, higher case volumes, and participation in a multidisciplinary tumor board were associated with ordering biomarkers (P < .05). Pulmonology was identified to have the leading responsibility for the initial diagnostic biopsy by most respondents (83%) and less often for staging (45%), leading discussions about biomarker testing with patients (28%), and for ordering biomarkers (22%). The most common reasons for not ordering biomarkers included the following: oncology was responsible (84%), it was not within their scope of practice (46%), or lack of the necessary knowledge (51%).InterpretationThis study shows that pulmonologists vary in their practices for ordering biomarkers, and many defer this responsibility to oncology. Despite the role of bronchoscopy and pulmonology societal guidelines for staging, many defer leadership of this process. Many pulmonologists lack the necessary resources and multidisciplinary infrastructure likely required to efficiently accomplish biomarker testing.","SummaryAim.To evaluate the effects of rifaximin through microbiota modulation in a model of hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Methods.Three groups of 8 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats each were divided as follows: the HCC group: rats fed a high-fat and choline-deficient diet plus diethylnitrosamine as a carcinogen, the hepatocellular carcinoma treated group: rats fed a high-fat and choline-deficient diet plus diethylnitrosamine and treated with rifaximin and the control group: animals fed standard diet and water. The rats were euthanized after 16 weeks. We performed analyses of liver pathology for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease severity and cancer grading, gene expression in intestinal and hepatic tissues and fecal microbiota.Results.All animals in the hepatocellular carcinoma group had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and developed hepatocellular carcinoma lesions. Rifaximin animals showed less intense non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (assessed by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score [NAS]) compared to the hepatocellular carcinoma group. Both the hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma + rifaximin groups showed areas of fibrosis as assessed by picrosirius red. Three animals in the rifaximin group did not develop cancerous lesions. Gut microbiota analyses revealed differences in diversity and composition in the control group vs hepatocellular carcinoma and rifaximin groups. Twelve differentially abundant genera were identified between the hepatocellular carcinoma and rifaximin groups. In the rifaximin group, gene expression of intestinal tight junctions decreased.Conclusions.In a rodent model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma, rifaximin reduces the histological severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, probably by modulating the gut microbiota independently of markers of intestinal permeability.",0
"BackgroundNon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common malignant lung tumor and is difficult to be eradicated due to its immunosuppressive microenvironment. Chlorin e6 (Ce6)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) could improve immunogenicity while destroying malignant tumor cells. However, the clinic application of Ce6-mediated PDT is limited by Ce6’s poor water solubility and insufficient accumulation in lung cancer. To address this issue, Ce6 was loaded onto functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles linked with glucose to improve the distribution of Ce6 in lung cancer.Materials and resultsThe results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–Vis spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy confirmed the successful preparation of the composites. Confocal and flow cytometry showed IO–PG–GLU–Ce6 significantly enhanced the uptake of Ce6 by lung cancer cells and produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS) under NIR light irradiation. In addition, the detection of cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis indicated IO–PG–GLU–Ce6 achieved stronger photo-toxicity to lung cancer cells. Moreover, IO–PG–GLU–Ce6 treatment effectively damaged the DNA of lung cancer cells and thereby activated STING, up-regulated the expression of IFN-β, HMGB1 and HSP90, indicating augmented immunogenicity of lung cancer cells. Further results of in vivo, organ imaging and tissue fluorescence sections demonstrated IO–PG–GLU–Ce6 significantly improved the distribution of Ce6 in tumor tissues of lung cancer-bearing mice as well. Finally, the findings of in vivo study and immunohistochemistry confirmed the better efficacy of IO–PG–GLU–Ce6. HE staining results of vital organs suggested that the composites were less toxic.ConclusionIn conclusion, Ce6 loaded by functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles linked with glucose exhibited both target photodynamic efficacy and the ability to enhance its immunogenicity in lung cancer. This study provides a promising strategy for augment of the targeting delivery of Ce6 and its mediated photodynamic and immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03879-x.","BackgroundEGFR exon 20 insertion (EGFR ex20ins) mutations account for about 10–12% of all EGFR-mutated tumors, which are usually associated with primary drug resistance to conventional EGFR-TKI therapy and worse survival outcomes, and are currently a major problem for clinicians in clinical management. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of sequencing technology and careful review of clinical data, investigators have gained a deeper understanding and clearer cognition of the clinicopathological features and molecular mechanisms of these EGFR ex20ins mutations.PurposeThe aim of this study was to systemically review the molecular structure and clinical characteristics of EGFR ex20ins mutations, and focus on summarizing the latest data of emerging therapies (including novel small-molecule EGFR-TKI drugs, specific monoclonal antibodies, novel drugs targeting other mechanisms, and immunotherapy) for those patients.ConclusionAdvances in overcoming these systemic challenges have greatly accelerated the development of new drugs targeting EGFR ex20ins, and are committed to designing more rational combination therapies to overcome or delay the emergence of drug resistance, ultimately improve the prognosis of such uncommon mutant populations.",1
"Lung cancer is among the most common instances of cancer subtypes and is associated with high mortality rates. Due to the availability of fewer therapies and delayed clinical investigations, the number of cancer incidences is rising dramatically. This is possibly an effect of immune modulations and chemotherapeutic drugs that raises cancer resistance. Among the list, IL-6 and IL-17 are host-derived paradoxical effectors that attune immune responses in malignant lung cells. Their excessive release in the cytokine milieu stabilizes immunosuppressive phenotypes, resulting in cellular perturbations. During tumor development, the significance of these molecules is reflected in their potential to regulate oncogenesis by initiating a myriad of signaling events that influence tumor growth and the metastatic ability of benign cancer cells. Moreover, their transactivation contributes to antiapoptotic mechanisms and favors cancer cell survival via constitutive expression of immunoregulatory molecules. Co-evolution and gene duplication events could be the major drivers behind cytokine evolution, which have prompted generic changes and, hence, the additive effect. The evolutionary model and statistical analysis provide evidence about the cytokines ancestral relationships and site-specific conservation, which is more convincing as both cytokines share cysteine-knot-like structures important in maintaining structural integrity. Funneling through the findings could help find residues that serve a catalytic role in immune functioning. Designing peptides or subunit vaccine formulations against those conserved residues could aid in combating lung cancer pathogenesis.","SummaryIn 2010, modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria were proposed as a way of adapting the RECIST criteria to the particularities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We intended to overcome some limitations of RECIST in measuring tumour shrinkage with local and systemic therapies, and also to refine the assessment of progression that could be misinterpreted with conventional RECIST 1.1, due to clinical events related to the natural progression of chronic liver disease (development of ascites, enlargement of lymph nodes, etc.). mRECIST has served its purpose since being adopted or included in clinical practice guidelines (European, American and Asian) for the management of HCC; it has also been instrumental for assessing response and time-to-event endpoints in several phase II and III investigations. Nowadays, mRECIST has become the standard tool for measurement of radiological endpoints at early/intermediate stages of HCC. At advanced stages, guidelines recommend both methods. mRECIST has been proven to capture higher objective response rates in tumours treated with molecular therapies and those responses have shown to be independently associated with better survival. With the advent of novel treatment approaches (that is immunotherapy) and combination therapies there is a need to further refine and clarify some concepts around the performance of mRECIST. Similarly, changes in the landscape of standard of care at advanced stages of the disease are pointing towards progression-free survival as a potential primary endpoint in some phase III investigations, as effective therapies applied beyond progression might mask overall survival results. Strict recommendations for adopting this endpoint have been reported. Overall, we review the performance of mRECIST during the last decade, incorporating novel clarifications and refinements in light of emerging challenges in the study and management of HCC.",0
"Background:Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early-stage breast cancer (EBC) is a heterogenous disease. Identification of better clinical and molecular biomarkers is essential to guide optimal therapy for each patient.Patients and methods:We analyzed rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) for patients with HR+/HER2-negative EBC in eight neoadjuvant arms in the I-SPY2 trial by clinical/molecular features: age, stage, histology, percentage estrogen receptor (ER) positivity, ER/progesterone receptor status, MammaPrint (MP)-High1 (0 to −0.57) versus MP-High2 (<−0.57), BluePrint (BP)-Luminal-type versus BP-Basal-type, and ImPrint immune signature. We quantified the clinical/molecular heterogeneity, assessed overlap among these biomarkers, and evaluated associations with pCR and DRFS.Results:Three hundred and seventy-nine patients with HR+/HER2-negative EBC were included in this analysis, with an observed pCR rate of 17% across treatment arms. pCR rates were higher in patients with stage II versus III disease (21% versus 9%, P = 0.0013), ductal versus lobular histology (19% versus 11%, P = 0.049), lower %ER positivity (≤66% versus >66%) (35% versus 9%, P = 3.4E-09), MP-High2 versus MP-High1 disease (31% versus 11%, P = 1.1E-05), BP-Basal-type versus BP-Luminal-type disease (34% versus 10%, P = 1.62E-07), and ImPrint-positive versus -negative disease (38% versus 10%, P = 1.64E-09). Patients with lower %ER were more likely to have MP-High2 and BP-Basal-type disease. At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, patients who achieved pCR had excellent outcomes irrespective of clinical/molecular features. Among patients who did not achieve pCR, DRFS events were more frequent in patients with MP-High2 and BP-Basal-type disease than those with MP-High1 and BP-Luminal-type disease.Conclusions:Among patients with high molecular-risk HR+/HER2-negative EBC, the MP-High2, BP-Basal-type, and ImPrint-positive signatures identified a partially overlapping subset of patients who were more likely to achieve Pcr in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± targeted agents or immunotherapy compared to patients with MP-High1, BP-Luminal-type, and ImPrint-negative disease. I-SPY2.2 is incorporating the use of these biomarkers to molecularly define specific patient populations and optimize treatment selection.","The tumor microenvironment and immune evasion function in a complex cellular network profoundly challenge the clinical outcome of promising therapies. Our recently published study reported that the subset of genes upregulated in ccRCC due to H3K4me1 and DNA demethylation potentially leads to an immunosuppressive environment. Thus, modulating H3K4me1 chromatin modifier SETD7 with a natural inhibitor in combination with immunotherapy might improve the immune landscape for a better therapeutic outcome. The present study was conducted via virtual screening and MD simulation using compounds from the literature, IMPPAT, and SuperNatural database. The phytochemical IMPHY002979 showed better binding affinity and lower energy than the reported R-PFI-2 and cyproheptadine inhibitors. The phytochemicals interact with the SET domain through H-bonding, as confirmed by MD simulation and molecular interaction analysis. Further, the compound was assessed using ADME parameters and free energy estimation, showing better pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, the non-accessibility of the histone methyltransferase activity domain of SET7 with IMPHY002979 can downregulate H3K4me1 and, thereby, the expression of genes potentially responsible for immunosuppressive TME. Thus, patient stratification based on molecular markers for immunotherapy and combining epigenetic modulators with therapeutic drugs will improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in ccRCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11030-024-11038-w.",0
"PurposeProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression may influence the prognosis of patients with localized esophageal cancer. The current study compared the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression between tumor cells and immune cells.MethodsArchival esophageal tumor tissue samples were collected from patients who received paclitaxel and cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in three prospective phase II trials. PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells was examined immunohistochemically by using the SP142 antibody and scored by two independent pathologists. The association of PD-L1 expression with patient’s outcomes was analyzed using a log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis.ResultsA total of 100 patients were included. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was positive (≥ 1%, TC-positive) in 55 patients; PD-L1 expression on immune cells was high (≥ 5%, IC-high) in 30 patients. TC-positive status was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.63, P = 0.035), whereas IC-high status was associated with improved OS (HR: 0.44, P = 0.0024). Multivariate analysis revealed that TC-positive, IC-high, and performance status were independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival and that IC-high and performance status were independent factors for OS. Furthermore, the combination of IC-high and TC-negative status was associated with the optimal OS, whereas that of TC-positive and IC-low status was associated with the worst OS.ConclusionPD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells may have different prognostic value for patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving neoadjuvant CRT. A combination of these two indexes may further improve the prognostic prediction.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03772-7.","The cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP), a bromodomain-containing protein, engages with multiple transcription factors and enhances the activation of many genes. CBP bromodomain acts as an epigenetic reader and plays an important role in the CBP-chromatin interaction which makes it an important drug target for treating many diseases. Though inhibiting CBP bromodomain was reported to have great potential in cancer therapeutics, approved CBP bromodomain inhibitor is yet to come. We utilized various in silico approaches like molecular docking, ADMET, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM-PBSA calculations, and in silico PASS predictions to identify potential CBP bromodomain inhibitors from marine natural compounds as they have been identified as having distinctive chemical structures and greater anticancer activities. To develop a marine natural compound library for this investigation, Lipinski’s rule of five was used. Sequential investigations utilizing molecular docking, ADMET studies, 100 ns MD simulations, and MM-PBSA calculations revealed that three marine compounds—ascididemin, neoamphimedine, and stelletin A—demonstrated superior binding affinity compared to the standard inhibitor, 69 A. These compounds also exhibited suitable drug-like properties, a favorable safety profile, and formed stable protein-ligand complexes. The in-silico PASS tool predicted that these compounds have significant potential for anticancer activity. Among them, ascididemin demonstrated the highest binding affinity in both molecular docking and MM-PBSA calculations, as well as a better stability profile in MD simulations. Hence, ascididemin can be a potential inhibitor of CBP bromodomain. However, in vitro and in vivo validation is required for further confirmation of these findings.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00258-5.",0
"BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common leukemia with low cure rate and poor prognosis among pediatric patients. The regulation of AML immune microenvironment and methylation remains to be explored. Pediatric and adult AML patients differ significantly in epigenetic factors, and the efficiency of treatment modalities varies between the two groups of patients.MethodsWe collected mRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation data from pediatric AML patients across multiple databases. Differentially expression genes were identified, and a gene–miRNA regulatory network was constructed. Prognostic risk models were established by integrating LASSO and Cox regression, and a nomogram was generated. Based on this model, we investigated tumor-infiltrating immune cells and cell communication, analyzing the biological functions and pathways associated with prognostic factors. Furthermore, the relationships between all prognostic factors and gene modules were explored, and the impact of these factors on treatment modalities was determined.ResultsWe developed an efficient prognostic risk model and identified HOXA9, SORT1, SH3BP5, mir-224 and mir-335 as biomarkers. We validated these findings in an external dataset and observed a correlation between age and risk in pediatric patients. AML samples with lower risk scores have a better prognosis and higher expression of immune-upregulated biomarkers, and have lower immune scores. Furthermore, we detected discrepancies in immune cell infiltration and interactions between high- and low-risk group samples, which affected the efficacy of immunotherapy. We evaluated all prognostic factors and predicted the effect of immunotherapy and medicine.ConclusionThis study comprehensively investigated the role of methylation signature genes in pediatric AML at the level of genomes and transcriptomes. The research aims to enhance the risk stratification, prognosis evaluation and assessment of treatment effectiveness of AML patients. This study also highlight the uniqueness of pediatric AML and foster the development of new immunotherapy and targeted therapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05284-y.","Acute myeloid leukaemias harbouring a rearrangement of the mixed lineage leukaemia gene (MLL) are aggressive haematopoietic malignancies that relapse early and have a poor prognosis (event-free survival less than 50%). Menin is a tumour suppressor, however, in MLL-rearranged leukaemias it functions as a co-factor which is mandatory for the leukaemic transformation by interaction with the N-terminal part of MLL, which is maintained in all MLL-fusion proteins. Inhibition of menin blocks leukaemogenesis and leads to differentiation and, in turn, to apoptosis of leukaemic blasts. Furthermore, nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) binds to specific chromatin targets, which are co-occupied by MLL, and menin inhibition has been shown to trigger degradation of mNPM1 resulting in a rapid decrease in gene expression and activating histone modifications. Therefore, disruption of the menin-MLL axis blocks leukaemias driven by NPM1 mutations for which the expression of menin-MLL target genes (for example, MEIS1, HOX etc.) is essential. To date at least six different menin-MLL inhibitors are undergoing clinical evaluation as first- and second-line monotherapy in acute leukaemias: DS-1594, BMF-219, JNJ-75276617, DSP-5336, revumenib, and ziftomenib, however, only for revumenib and ziftomenib early clinical data have been reported. In the revumenib phase I/II AUGMENT-101 trial (N = 68) with very heavily pretreated AML patients the ORR was 53% with a CR rate of 20%. The ORR in patients harbouring MLL rearrangement of mNPM1 was 59%. Patients who achieved a response had a mOS of 7 months. Similar results have been reported for ziftomenib in the phase I/II COMET-001 trial. ORR was 40% and CRc was 35% in AML patients with mNPM1. However, outcome was worse in AML patients with a MLL rearrangement (ORR 16.7%, CRc 11%). Differentiation syndrome was a notable adverse event. The clinical development of novel menin-MLL inhibitors is well in line with the currently ongoing paradigm shift towards targeted therapies seen in the AML treatment landscape. Moreover, the clinical assessment of combinations of these inhibitors with established therapy options in AML could be the fuel for an improved outcome of MLL/NPM1 patients.",1
"AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.","AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.",1
"Purpose: T cell-based immunotherapy, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, has emerged as an appropriate approach for treating hematologic malignancies and is currently under investigation in clinical trials for solid tumors. Despite significant improvements in CAR-T cell production processes, the isolation and expansion of CAR-engineered T cells continue to pose significant challenges. The aim of this research is to provide a simple and cost-effective method for the isolation and expansion of human CAR-T cells. This novel concept applies coated fetal bovine serum (FBS) culture plates and focuses on enhancing viability and functionality to improve the adherence of suspended T cells. Methods: This study evaluated a two-dimensional (2D) culture technique for isolating the CAR-T cells that target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) utilizing matrices pre-coated with 0.2% glutaraldehyde and FBS. Jurkat cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the anti-PSMA CAR construct. FBS-coated and commercialized Matrigel-coated matrices were used for single-cell isolation and clonal expansion. Functional tests were conducted to assess the activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells and the IFN-γ release assay subsequent to cloning and expansion. Results: Transfection efficiency markedly improved, with 88.4% of Lenti-X 293T cells demonstrating green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Among the Jurkat cells, 57.1% showed GFP expression post-transduction, of which 34.1% showed surface expression of anti-PSMA CAR. Clonal expansion on the FBS-coated matrix proved effective, yielding 92.1% GFP-positive isolated cells. Functional assays demonstrated that CAR-T cells co-cultured with LNCaP cells exhibited significantly enhanced proliferation, activation (as indicated by CD69 and CD25 expression), and cytokine release assay (IFN-γ) compared with those co-cultured with DU 145 and mock cells.Conclusion: This new approach is efficient, economical, and scalable for isolating specific homogenous T cells and promoting their clonal proliferation and expansion. Furthermore, this method improves T cell adherence, proliferation, and functional effectiveness, offering a potential foundation for advancing CAR-T cell therapies aimed at solid tumors. Future research should concentrate on optimizing culture conditions and testing this method in preclinical animal models to ensure its clinical applicability and efficacy.","The process of aging, which involves progressive changes in the body over time, is closely associated with the development of age-related diseases. Cellular senescence is a pivotal hallmark and mechanism of the aging process. The accumulation of senescent cells can significantly contribute to the onset of age-related diseases, thereby compromising overall health. Conversely, the elimination of senescent cells enhances the body's regenerative and reparative capacity, thereby retarding the aging process. Here, we present a brief overview of 12 Hallmarks of aging and subsequently emphasize the potential of immune checkpoint blockade, innate immune cell therapy (including T cells, iNKT cells, macrophages, and NK cells), as well as CAR-T cell therapy for inducing and augmenting immune responses aimed at eliminating senescent cells. In addition to CAR-T cells, we also explore the possibility of engineered immune cells such as CAR-NK and CAR-M cells to eliminate senescent cells. In summary, immunotherapy, as an emerging strategy for the treatment of aging, offers new prospects for age-related research.",1
"PurposeTumor growth relies on the sufficient blood supply and continuously requires new blood vessels to maintain, which lead to vascular abnormalities (Folkman, N Engl J Med 285:1182–1186, 1971). Antiangiogenic therapy has emerged with the goal of normalizing vasculature and tumor microenvironment (TME). Some antiangiogenic therapies combined with chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy have been approved for clinical application. In this review, we summarize the recent advances of antiangiogenic combination therapeutic strategies in advanced NSCLC.MethodsReferences of this review are searched through PubMed and EMBASE and the abstracts of cancer conferences. The ClinicalTrials.gov database was used for relative trials.ResultsBased on different mechanisms, antiangiogenic agents can be divided into monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which mainly include bevacizumab and ramucirumab, and multi-target antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which include sunitinib, sorafenib, nintedanib, apatinib, anlotinib, fruquintinib, etc. In recent years, a number of large clinical studies have shown that antiangiogenic agents have conferred a significant overall survival (OS) benefit to patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). More and more evidences confirm that the combination of antiangiogenic agents with chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy can improve the effect and prolong the survival of NSCLC patients. However, many problems about the application of antiangiogenic agents on advanced NSCLC patients still need to be explored. For example, the combination therapy of multi-target antiangiogenic agents is just beginning, and the biomarkers are not clear.ConclusionsAntiangiogenic agents can achieve therapeutic benefit in advanced NSCLC patients and the combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy can lead to synergistic effect. However, exploring the best combination therapy and efficacy-related biomarkers needs further study.","BackgroundTrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells and many malignant tumor cells. However, data on TROP2 expression in advanced lung cancer are insufficient, and its changes have not been fully evaluated.MethodsWe assessed the prevalence and changes in TROP2 expression in patients with lung cancer who received anti-cancer treatments using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with an anti-TROP2 antibody (clone: SP295). IHC scores were graded from 0 to 3; grade ≥ 2 was considered positive for TROP2 expression. We defined a difference in IHC score, before and after anti-cancer treatments, as the change in TROP2 expression.ResultsBefore anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 89% (143/160) of the patients and was significantly more common in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma than in neuroendocrine carcinoma (P < 0.001). After anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 87% (139/160) of the patients. The distribution of TROP2 expression in post-treatment samples was analogous to that in pre-treatment samples when compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P = 0.509). However, an increase in TROP2 expression was seen in 19 (12%), and a decrease in 20 (13%) patients. Patients treated with targeted therapy showed significantly higher changes in TROP2 expression (P = 0.019) and thoracic radiotherapy was more likely to increase TROP2 expression than chemotherapy alone.ConclusionAlthough some anti-cancer treatments might alter the TROP2 expression, TROP2 was expressed in most lung cancer specimens before and after anti-cancer treatments. These results support the development of TROP2-directed therapy against advanced lung cancer in various treatment lines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03784-3.",1
"PurposeExisting biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.MethodsAn animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.ResultsWe identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes (RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and metastasis.ConclusionThe model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04495-z.","PurposeUveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular malignant tumor in adults. Due to the lack of effective treatments for metastatic UM, the survival of UM has not changed over the past 3 decades. Therefore, it is important to identify essential genes regulating the metastasis of UM.MethodsIn this study, a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in an orthotopic mouse model of UM was performed to identify the regulatory genes conferring the metastatic phenotype. Loss-of-function analyses were performed to explore the function of G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) in UM metastasis in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the function of GPS2 as a tumor suppressor in UM.ResultsAmong the highest-ranking genes, we found several validated tumor suppressors, such as SHPRH, GPS2, PRPH2, and hsa-mir-1229; GPS2 was chosen as the candidate gene for further studies. GPS2 was lower expressed in the tumor tissues of UM patients. Furthermore, knocking-down GPS2 promoted the proliferation and metastatic abilities of UM cells both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, analysis of the transcriptome data revealed that silencing GPS2 upregulates oncogenic signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K-Akt, and in the meantime downregulates tumor suppressor signaling pathway Slit/Robo in UM cells.ConclusionAltogether, our study proved that the GPS2 gene functions as a tumor suppressor and might be a novel potential therapeutic target for UM treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04160-5.",1
"AbstractAging naturally involves a decline in biological functions, often triggering a disequilibrium of physiological processes. A common outcome is the altered response exerted by the immune system to counteract infections, known as immunosenescence, which has been recognized as a primary cause, among others, of the so‐called long‐COVID syndrome. Moreover, the uncontrolled immunoreaction leads to a state of subacute, chronic inflammatory state known as inflammaging, responsible in turn for the chronicization of concomitant pathologies in a self‐sustaining process. Anti‐inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs are the current choice for the therapy of inflammaging in post‐COVID complications, with contrasting results. The increasing knowledge of the biochemical pathways of inflammaging led to disclose new small molecules‐based therapies directed toward different biological targets involved in inflammation, immunological response, and oxidative stress. Herein, paying particular attention to recent clinical data and preclinical literature, we focus on the role of endocannabinoid system in inflammaging, and the promising therapeutic option represented by the CB2R agonists, the role of novel ligands of the formyl peptide receptor 2 and ultimately the potential of newly discovered monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors with neuroprotective activity in the treatment of immunosenescence.","BackgroundColon cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers of the digestive tract. There is mounting evidence that genes associated with oxidative stress might affect the tumour immune microenvironment during tumour growth, maintenance, and treatment response. However, how oxidative stress-related genes affect prognostic importance, tumour microenvironment features, and treatment outcomes in colon cancer patients has not been fully elucidated.MethodsThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used to construct a signature model and nomogram using step and Cox regression approaches to investigate how gene expression affected immunological responses to colon cancer, including the degree of immune infiltration, MSI, and drug sensitivity.Results and conclusionsThe nomogram and the signature model had strong prognostic potential for colon cancer, with gene expression highly correlated with multiple immune cells. The first signature model and nomogram including oxidative stress-related genes were constructed for use in clinical decision-making. In addition, SRD5A1, GSR, TXN, TRAF2 and TRAP1 were identified as potential biomarkers for colon cancer diagnosis and indicators for immunotherapy.",1
"ObjectiveSMARCD1 is a part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex family, which consists of transcription factors that are implicated in various types of cancer. Examining SMARCD1 expression in human cancers can provide valuable insights into the development and progression of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM).MethodsOur study comprehensively examined the association between SMARCD1 expression and numerous factors, including prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME), immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) in SKCM. Then we utilized immunohistochemical staining to measure the SMARCD1 expression in both SKCM tissues and normal skin tissues. Furthermore, we conducted in vitro experimentation to evaluate the effects of SMARCD1 knockdown on SKCM cells.ResultsWe found that aberrant expression of SMARCD1 across 16 cancers was strongly correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In addition, our research revealed that SMARCD1 expression is associated with multiple factors in different types of cancer, including immune infiltration, TME, immune-related genes, MSI, TMB, and sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. SMARCD1 is likely involved in various SKCM signaling pathways and biological processes. Additionally, our research revealed that an SMARCD1-based risk factor model accurately predicted OS in SKCM patients. Furthermore, the downregulation of SMARCD1 expression demonstrated a significant inhibition of SKCM cell proliferation and migration, as well as an increase in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.ConclusionWe conclude that SMARCD1 is a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarker for SKCM, and its expression has significant clinical implications for the development of novel treatment strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05064-8.","CLIC5 encoded protein associates with actin-based cytoskeletal and is increasingly thought to play significant roles in human cancers. We use TCGA and GEO to explore CLIC5 expression differences, mutation and DNA methylation, TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration. We verified the mRNA expression of CLIC5 in human ovarian cancer cells by real-time PCR and detected the expression of CLIC5 as well as immune marker genes in ovarian cancer by immunohistochemistry. The pan-cancer analysis showed that CLIC5 is highly expressed in several malignant tumors. In some cancers, CLIC5 expression in tumor samples is associated with poorer overall survival. For example, patients with ovarian cancer with high expression of CLIC5 have a poor prognosis. CLIC5 mutation frequency increased in all tumor types. The CLIC5 promoter is hypomethylated in most tumors. CLIC5 was associated with tumor immunity and different immune cells of different tumor types, such as CD8 + T cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, etc. CLIC5 was positively correlated with various immune checkpoints, and TMB and MSI were correlated with dysregulation of CLIC5 in tumors. The expression of CLIC5 in ovarian cancer was detected by qPCR and IHC, and the results were consistent with the bioinformatics results. There were a strong positive correlation between CLIC5 expression and M2 macrophage (CD163) infiltration and a negative correlation with CD8 + T-cell infiltration. In conclusions, our first pan-cancer analysis offered a detailed grasp of the cancerogenic functions of CLIC5 in a variety of malignancies. CLIC5 participated in immunomodulation and performed a crucial function in the tumor microenvironment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04927-4.",1
"N6 methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), has been extensively studied in recent years. Dysregulation of m6A and its associated machinery (including “writers”, “erasers” and “readers”) has been frequently observed in various cancer types, and their dysregulation profiles may serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers. The dysregulated m6A modifiers have been shown to function as oncogenes or tumour suppressors, and play essential roles in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, metabolism, drug resistance, and immune evasion, as well as in cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumour microenvironment, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the dysregulated m6A machinery for cancer treatment. In this review, we illustrate the mechanisms by which m6A modifiers interplay and orchestrate the fate of target RNAs. We also describe the state-of-the-art methodologies for mapping global m6A in cancer epitranscriptomes. We further summarize the recent discoveries regarding the dysregulations of m6A and the associated machinery in cancers and their pathological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms in cancers. Finally, we discuss the findings on m6A related molecules as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers, as well as the recent development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting oncogenic m6A modifiers and their preclinical results in treating cancers.","AbstractThe management of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) has transformed over the past 2 decades. Advances in surgical techniques, systemic therapies, and local treatments have resulted in a paradigm shift. Disease that would once have been considered terminal is now frequently treated aggressively with both a disease-free and overall survival benefit. In line with the expanding range of treatment options, there has been an increase in the volume and complexity of imaging required in the management of these patients to ensure optimal patient selection and outcome. The radiologist plays a pivotal role in interpreting these studies, conveying the relevant information and informing the discussion at multidisciplinary team meetings. The purpose of this review is to provide an update for radiologists on the current surgical management of patients with CRLM highlighting specific imaging information that is required by the multidisciplinary team when assessing resectability and/or the need for additional liver-directed therapies.",0
"Background:In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) revolution is rapidly moving from metastatic to early-stage, however, the impact of clinicopathological variables and optimal treatment sequencing remain unclear.Methods:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with ICI as single agent or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (PCT) were included. Primary outcomes were pathological complete response (pCR), event free survival (EFS) (neoadjuvant/perioperative), and disease-free survival (DFS) (adjuvant). Secondary outcomes were major pathological response (MPR), overall survival (OS), toxicity, surgical outcomes (neoadjuvant/perioperative); OS and toxicity (adjuvant). An additional secondary endpoint was to compare EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative strategies.Results:8 RCTs (2 neoadjuvant, 4 perioperative, 2 adjuvant) (4661 participants) were included. Neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI+PCT significantly improved pCR, EFS, OS, MPR and R0 resection compared to PCT. Adjuvant ICI significantly improved DFS compared to placebo. There was a significant subgroup interaction by PD-L1 status (χ2 = 10.72, P = 0.005), pCR (χ2 = 17.80, P < 0.0001), and stage (χ2 = 4.46, P = 0.003) for EFS. No difference according to PD-L1 status was found for pCR, with 14% of patients having PD-L1 negative tumors still experiencing a pCR. No interaction by PD-L1 status was found for DFS upon adjuvant ICI. Indirect comparison showed no difference in EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative ICI+PCT.Conclusions:PD-L1 status, pCR and stage impact on survival upon neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI. The restriction of neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI to PD-L1 + patients could preclude pCR and long-term benefit in the PD-L1-subgroup. Neoadjuvant and perioperative could be equivalent strategies.","PurposeThe regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subpopulation of lymphocytes that suppress the immune responses. The prognostic value of Tregs in lymphoma patients remains controversial. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the role of Tregs in the prognosis of lymphoma patients.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to obtain eligible studies that evaluated the prognostic factor of Tregs for lymphoma patients. Hazards ratios (HRs) with the matching 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were merged to estimate the prognostic value of Tregs.ResultsWe finally retrieved 23 eligible studies, including a total of 2269 patients. The overall pooled analysis on all types of lymphomas showed that Tregs had a significantly positive association with prolonged overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.633, 95% CI 0.528–0.758) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.451, 95% CI 0.261–0.779). Subgroup analysis indicated that high Tregs were significantly correlated with longer OS in Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and natural killer/T cell lymphoma. However, there was no significant association of Tregs with T cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.ConclusionsIncreased Tregs indicates a better prognosis for patients with lymphoma. Tregs could be used as a valuable prognostic biomarker of lymphoma patients.",1
"ResumenLas enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales son entidades crónicas con manifestaciones y evolución heterogéneas, por lo que constituyen un desafío diagnóstico y terapéutico. En los últimos años se han producido cambios trascendentales en el manejo de las enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales, de la mano del mayor conocimiento de su inmunofisiopatología y evolución a largo plazo. A diferencia de otras enfermedades, la clínica no es soberana y debemos respaldarnos en parámetros más certeros de inflamación para la toma de decisiones. Con el advenimiento de nuevas herramientas bioquímicas, de imágenes y endoscópicas, el enfoque actual está dirigido a lograr un menor retraso en el diagnóstico y un monitoreo estrecho de la curación mucosa como una de las metas fundamentales asociada a una evolución favorable. El objetivo de esta revisión es actualizar los nuevos conceptos respecto a estrategias diagnósticas y de monitoreo en las enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales.","PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant patients with CRC using a large population-based database.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2009 to 2019. Pregnant patients with and without CRC were compared for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, maternal and perinatal outcomes, and hospital burden.ResultsThe study included 306 pregnancies with CRC and 40,887,353 pregnancies without CRC. Pregnant patients with CRC were older and more likely to be White. A significant association was observed between CRC and a history of inflammatory bowel disease or a family history of gastrointestinal cancer. Pregnant patients with CRC had higher odds of maternal death (AOR 260.99, 95% CI 33.36–2041.64), cardiac arrhythmia (AOR 13.73, 95% CI 4.21–44.76), acute kidney injury (AOR 32.6, 95% CI 5.29–200.77), severe sepsis (AOR 163.98, 95% CI 22.05–1219.65), and respiratory failure (AOR 31.67, 95% CI 4.11–243.98). Furthermore, the CRC group experienced higher odds of cesarean section (AOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05–3.03), preterm birth (AOR 4.16, 95% CI 2.05–8.47), and intrauterine death (AOR 13.18, 95% CI 3.33–52.16). Distinct differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes were observed based on the location of CRC. Pregnant patients with CRC faced higher hospital charges and had longer hospital stays during delivery hospitalization compared to those without CRC.ConclusionPregnant patients with CRC are at increased risk for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, emphasizing the importance of early detection, timely intervention, and comprehensive management during pregnancy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05248-2.",1
"BackgroundIn CLEAR, lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (L+P) significantly improved efficacy versus sunitinib in first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We report results from CLEAR biomarker analyses.MethodsPD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing assays (whole exome sequencing/RNA-sequencing) were performed on archival tumor specimens.For IHC-derived/RNA-sequencing analyses, a continuous analysis was performed adjusting by Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score for: PD-L1 CPS versus best overall response (BOR)/PFS; and each gene-signature score (T-cell inflamed gene-expression profile [TcellinfGEP]/non-TcellinfGEP signatures including proliferation and angiogenesis) versus BOR/PFS.Association between mutation status of RCC driver genes and PFS were analyzed for genes for which ≥20 patients per arm had oncogenic alterations. Association of molecular subtypes with outcome was evaluated with baseline KPS adjustments. The set of biomarkers evaluated and statistical significance criteria for PD-L1 CPS, gene signature scores, and molecular subtypes were pre-specified.ResultsWithin-arm analyses using continuous values showed no association between PD-L1 levels and BOR/PFS for either treatment.PFS hazard ratios between arms were similar regardless of mutant or wildtype subgroups of RCC driver genes (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, KDM5C).No associations between PFS and gene-signature scores were observed for L+P. With sunitinib, high proliferation and MYC signature scores showed shorter PFS; high angiogenesis and microvessel density signature scores showed longer PFS.Six new molecular subtypes were defined. Tumors of patients with favorable/intermediate risk were enriched in angiogenesis and angiogenesis/stromal clusters; those with poor risk were enriched in proliferative and unclassified (low-TcellinfGEP/low-angiogenesis/low-proliferation) clusters. No association between molecular subtypes and PFS for L+P/sunitinib was observed (after adjustment for KPS and gene signatures that were individually associated with PFS).ConclusionsImprovements in ORR and PFS for L+P versus sunitinib in aRCC were observed consistently across a range of biomarker subgroups defined using RCC driver mutations, PD-L1, gene expression signatures, and molecular subtypes.","Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) based liquid kidney biopsies have the potential to detect the chances of kidney transplant rejection. Several studies have found that dd-cfDNA can be used to determine the risk of kidney transplant rejection and may correlate with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A high concentration of dd-cfDNA in the body fluids may indicate possible transplant rejection since dd-cfDNA is released as a result of apoptotic and necrotic processes initiated by the recipient’s immune system. dd-cfDNA assays have advantages over conventional biopsies since they are noninvasive, and therefore, have the potential to provide a safe and reliable biomarker. Different dd-cfDNA levels have been reported above a number of cutoff thresholds: ABMR at 2.45% and TCMR at 1.3%, compared with 0.44% in healthy patients; and eGFR at 2.5%, a decrease of 25% compared with healthy patients. These results indicate the levels of dd-cfDNA that may be used to signal possible kidney rejection. dd-cfDNA assay is a rapid technique, making it particularly useful in emergencies, and further research into its use in the study of kidney rejection should prove beneficial.",1
"KRAS is an important oncogenic driver which is mutated in numerous cancers. Recent advances in the selective targeting of KRAS mutants via small molecule inhibitors and targeted protein degraders have generated an increase in research activity in this area in recent years. As such, there is a need for new assay platforms to profile next generation inhibitors which improve on the potency and selectivity of existing drug candidates, while evading the emergence of resistance. Here, we describe the development of a new panel of biochemical and cell-based assays to evaluate the binding and function of known chemical entities targeting mutant KRAS. Our assay panels generated selectivity profiles and quantitative binding interaction dissociation constants for small molecules and degraders against wild type, G12C, G12D, and G12V KRAS, which were congruent with published data. These assays can be leveraged for additional mutants of interest beyond those described in this study, using both overexpressed cell-free systems and cell-based systems with endogenous protein levels.","Although small-molecule inhibitors with moderate efficacy targeting MYC have been previously described, to this point, research efforts have failed to bring a suitable small-molecule MYC inhibitor to the clinic. Herein, the discovery of a series of novel MYC degraders bearing VHL to target the “undruggable” MYC is presented. The molecules are based on connecting a known MYC binder to a VHL ligand or pomalidomide to induce MYC degradation in various cancer cells known to express MYC. Representative compounds from our work induced MYC degradation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Selected compounds, CSI86 and CSI107, displayed antiproliferative activity (IC50 values of 13–18 μM) against breast and prostate cancer cells. The lead molecules were further evaluated in terms of cell uptake, potential to degrade MYC, and pharmacokinetics in mice. Encouraging results presented herein suggest that the presented analogs may serve as prototype structures of future therapeutic agents for the treatment of MYC-dependent tumors. MYC protein degraders can well complement the more established inhibition approaches that have been presented in the past (for example, disruption of the MYC–MAX complex formation by small-molecule inhibitors).",1
"The goal of this project was to demonstrate that subpopulations of cells in tumors can uniquely fluctuate in size in response to environmental conditions created during drug treatment, thereby acting as a dynamic “rheostat” to create a favorable tumor environment for growth. The cancer modeling used for these studies was subpopulations of melanoma cells existing in cultured and tumor systems that differed in aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. However, similar observations were found in other cancer types in addition to melanoma, making them applicable broadly across cancer. The approach was designed to show that either ALDHhigh and ALDHlow subpopulations rapidly epigenetically transition between stem-cell-like high into nonstem-like low production states to create an environment during drug treatment that would enable optimal cellular proliferation and tumor expansion to facilitate drug resistance. The controlled experiments showed proportional changes in each cell population to reach an evolutionarily stable equilibrium mediated by the needed levels of ALDH enzyme activity. Mechanistically, cell population size changes served to functionally move the aldehyde and the resulting reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to those compatible with optimal cellular proliferation with population fluctuations dependent on the levels of drug induced tumor stress. This is the first report documenting fluctuations in the sizes of cell populations in tumors to cooperatively assist in drug resistance development.","PurposeAnlotinib is an oral small-molecule multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor that hampers neovascularization thus providing antitumor effect. The ALTER 0303 trial was a multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The ALTER 0303 results showed that patients in the anlotinib group had a median progression-free survival of 5.4 months, a significant improvement compared with 1.4 months in the placebo group; however, median overall survival was only extended by 3.3 months (9.6 vs 6.3 months). The problem of anlotinib resistance cannot be ignored, and an in-depth exploration of biomarkers of anlotinib treatment response is urgently needed to further improve the efficacy of anlotinib in the treatment of NSCLC. This study aimed to identify plasma exosome markers that could be used to monitor the efficacy of anlotinib.MethodsWe enrolled 5 patients with advanced NSCLC, and 15 blood samples were collected before anlotinib treatment, when the treatment was effective, and when the treatment was ineffective. The plasma exosomal RNA profiles were analyzed by whole-transcriptome sequencing at three different stages. The expression of dysregulated exosomal RNAs in 43 additional patients was also verified by real-time quantitative PCR.ResultsIn the plasma exosomal RNA profiles of the 5 patients with advanced NSCLC during treatment with anlotinib, 7 miRNAs, 3 lncRNAs, and 83 mRNAs were significantly dysregulated. The regulation trend was opposite when the treatment was effective and ineffective, showing dynamic changes. After validation, we finally found that plasma exosomal lnc-SNAPC5-3:4 was significantly upregulated when anlotinib treatment was effective, and it was significantly downregulated when the treatment failed (p < 0.05). Thus, it can be used as a potential biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of anlotinib.ConclusionOur results demonstrate the potential of plasma exosomal lnc-SNAPC5-3:4 as a biomarker for monitoring anlotinib efficacy.",1
"PurposeBecause patients younger than 40 years are rarely enrolled in clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their survival benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) needs to be clarified.MethodsThe National Cancer Database was queried for patients who were diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC between 2016 and 2018. ICIs were administered in the first-line setting. The overall survival (OS) of patients with stage IV NSCLC according to the receipt of ICIs was compared in different age groups (< 40, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years). Multivariate analyses identified the clinical characteristics predictive of OS. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to reduce the biases arising from clinical characteristics.ResultsThis study included 126,476 patients with stage IV NSCLC. In univariate analysis, ICI treatment was not associated with a survival benefit in patients younger than 40 years with stage IV NSCLC relative to their ICI-naïve counterparts after PSM (median OS: 24.2 months vs. 24.0 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81–1.27, P = 0.9031). Multivariate analysis revealed that ICI use was not an independent predictor of OS in patients with stage IV NSCLC < 40 years old (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.76–1.21, P = 0.7230). Sequential improvement of the HR was observed with increasing age.ConclusionOur study suggested a poor survival benefit of ICIs in stage IV NSCLC patients younger than 40 years old, which should be validated in prospective studies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05167-2.","Mononuclear phagocytes such as monocytes, tissue-specific macrophages and dendritic cells are primary actors in both innate and adaptive immunity. These professional phagocytes can be parasitized by intracellular bacteria, turning them from housekeepers to hiding places and favoring chronic and/or disseminated infection. One of the most infamous is the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB), which is the most pandemic and one of the deadliest diseases with one third of the world’s population infected, and an average of 1.8 million deaths/year worldwide.Here we demonstrate the effective targeting and intracellular delivery of antibiotics to infected macrophages both in vitro and in vivo, using pH sensitive nanoscopic polymersomes made of PMPC-PDPA block copolymer. Polymersomes showed the ability to significantly enhance the efficacy of the antibiotics killing Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and another established intracellular pathogen the Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, they demonstrated to easily access TB-like granuloma tissues - one of the harshest environments to penetrate - in zebrafish models. We thus successfully exploited this targeting for the effective eradication of several intracellular bacteria, including the M. tuberculosis - the etiological agent of human TB.",0
"Despite the notable efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, resistance in most individuals necessitates additional investigation. For this study, we collected tumor tissues from nine HCC patients receiving anti-PD1 monotherapy and conducted RNA sequencing. These findings revealed significant upregulation of GSDME, which is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in anti-PD1-resistant patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated levels of GSDME+ macrophages in HCC tissues presented a poorer prognosis. The analysis of single-cell sequencing data and flow cytometry revealed that the suppression of GSDME expression in nontumor cells resulted in a decrease in the proportion of M2-like macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TIME) of HCC while concurrently augmenting the cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells. The non-N-terminal fragment of GSDME within macrophages combines with PDPK1, thereby activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and facilitating M2-like polarization. The small-molecule Eliprodil inhibited the increase in PDPK1 phosphorylation mediated by GSDME site 1. The combination of Eliprodil and anti-PD1 was effective in the treatment of both spontaneous HCC in c-Myc + /+;Alb-Cre + /+ mice and in a hydrodynamic tail vein injection model, which provides a promising strategy for novel combined immunotherapy.","Although major progress has been made in the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for hematological malignancies, this method is ineffective against solid tumors largely because of the limited infiltration, activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells. To overcome this issue, we engineered CAR-T cells with synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors, which induce local tumor-specific secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading enzymes at the tumor site. SynNotch CAR-T cells achieve precise ECM recognition and robustly kill targeted tumors, with synNotch-induced enzyme production enabling the degradation of components of the tumor ECM. In addition, this regulation strongly increased the infiltration of CAR-T cells and the clearance of solid tumors, resulting in tumor regression without toxicity in vivo. Notably, synNotch CAR-T cells also promoted the persistent activation of CAR-T cells in patient-derived tumor organoids. Thus, we constructed a synthetic T-cell system that increases the infiltration and antitumor function of CAR-T cells, providing a strategy for targeting ECM-rich solid tumors.",1
"ABSTRACTBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, but they can induce immune-related adverse events, including immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonia (CIP), a severe lung complication. CIP, particularly Grades 3–4, is associated with poor prognosis, indicating a critical need for research on this issue. Our study aimed to investigate the risk factors and biomarkers associated with severe CIP in lung cancer patients treated with ICIs, where OS represents overall survival and PFS denotes progression-free survival.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 106 lung cancer patients with CIP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 2019 to 2023, categorized into four severity grades.ResultsThe median time to onset of CIP was 5.17 months. Patients with Grade 3–4 CIP had a median PFS of 6.5 months and OS of 11.2 months. Univariate analysis identified phosphocreatine kinase below 61.5 U/l, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) below 1.96, and BMI below 21.26 as predictive factors for Grades 3–4 CIP. Multivariate analysis confirmed that a decreased FVC was a significant predictor.ConclusionsA decreased FVC below 1.96 emerged as a predictive factor for Grades 3–4 CIP, highlighting the importance of monitoring FVC in patients receiving ICIs.","AbstractIntroductionAdjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluated the effects of adjuvant ICI treatment duration on RFS and overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence.MethodsThe RFS and OS of patients from three centers who received either adjuvant ICI therapy or active surveillance after curative hepatic resection between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, were analyzed. Further analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of ICI treatment duration on RFS and OS.ResultsA total of 1,271 patients were included, of whom 1,032 (81.2%) received active surveillance and 239 (18.8%) received adjuvant ICI therapy. The median RFS in the adjuvant therapy cohort was 22.6 months (95% CI 18.3–26.9), significantly higher than the RFS of 19.1 months (95% CI 16.4–21.4) in the active surveillance cohort (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66–0.95; p = 0.019). The median OS was not reached for either group, but OS tended to be better in the adjuvant therapy cohort than in the active surveillance group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.94; p = 0.010). Similar results were obtained after propensity score matching. Among patients who received adjuvant ICI therapy, those who received it for longer than 6 months had slightly higher RFS (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42–1.04; p = 0.071) and OS (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.30–1.17; p = 0.128) than those who received it for up to 6 months.ConclusionsAdjuvant ICI therapy significantly improves the prognosis of patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after curative resection. Six months of adjuvant ICI treatment may be insufficient.",1
"AbstractBiomaterials often have subtle properties that ultimately drive their bespoke performance. Given this nuanced structure–function behavior, the standard scientific approach of one experiment at a time or design of experiment methods is largely inefficient for the discovery of complex biomaterials. More recently, high-throughput experimentation coupled with machine learning methods has matured beyond expert users allowing scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds to access these powerful data science tools. As a result, we now have the opportunity to strategically utilize all available data from high-throughput experiments to train efficacious models and map the structure-function behavior of biomaterials for their discovery. Herein, we discuss this necessary shift to data-driven determination of structure–function properties of biomaterials as we highlight how machine learning is leveraged in identifying physicochemical cues for biomaterials in tissue engineering, gene delivery, drug delivery, protein stabilization, and antifouling materials. We also discuss data-mining approaches that are coupled with machine learning to map biomaterial functions that reduce the load on experimental approaches for faster biomaterial discovery. Ultimately, harnessing the prowess of machine learning will lead to accelerated discovery and development of optimal biomaterial designs.","The cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP), a bromodomain-containing protein, engages with multiple transcription factors and enhances the activation of many genes. CBP bromodomain acts as an epigenetic reader and plays an important role in the CBP-chromatin interaction which makes it an important drug target for treating many diseases. Though inhibiting CBP bromodomain was reported to have great potential in cancer therapeutics, approved CBP bromodomain inhibitor is yet to come. We utilized various in silico approaches like molecular docking, ADMET, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM-PBSA calculations, and in silico PASS predictions to identify potential CBP bromodomain inhibitors from marine natural compounds as they have been identified as having distinctive chemical structures and greater anticancer activities. To develop a marine natural compound library for this investigation, Lipinski’s rule of five was used. Sequential investigations utilizing molecular docking, ADMET studies, 100 ns MD simulations, and MM-PBSA calculations revealed that three marine compounds—ascididemin, neoamphimedine, and stelletin A—demonstrated superior binding affinity compared to the standard inhibitor, 69 A. These compounds also exhibited suitable drug-like properties, a favorable safety profile, and formed stable protein-ligand complexes. The in-silico PASS tool predicted that these compounds have significant potential for anticancer activity. Among them, ascididemin demonstrated the highest binding affinity in both molecular docking and MM-PBSA calculations, as well as a better stability profile in MD simulations. Hence, ascididemin can be a potential inhibitor of CBP bromodomain. However, in vitro and in vivo validation is required for further confirmation of these findings.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00258-5.",0
"Background/ObjectivesUnfortunately, not all metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients receive available life-prolonging systemic therapies, emphasizing the need to optimize mCRPC treatment selections. Better guidelines are necessary to determine genetic testing for prostate cancer.Subjects/MethodsIn this two-part expert opinion-based guide, we provide an expert consensus opinion on the utilization of germline and somatic testing to detect HRR alterations in patients with mCRPC. This guide was developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel that convened in 2023-2024, including representatives from medical oncology, urology, radiation oncology, pathology, medical genomics, and basic science.Results/ConclusionsIn this second part, we highlight how genetic testing can lead to improved, life-prolonging mCRPC therapeutic strategies based on a review of the recent phase III trials and subsequent regulatory approvals for PARP inhibitors in mCRPC.","ImportanceRecurrent/metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (R/M AdCC) presents a clinical challenge with limited treatment options, particularly in the face of unsatisfactory efficacy from current therapeutic approaches. This review underscores the unmet clinical needs in managing R/M AdCC, emphasising the imperative for novel therapeutic strategies to address this critical gap.ObjectiveThe primary objective of this review is to comprehensively analyse and assess trials investigating therapeutic approaches for R/M AdCC. Emphasis is placed on endpoints such as tumour response rates and progression-free survival. The specific interventions, populations, and outcomes examined in these trials will be detailed to provide a focused and informative systematic review.Evidence reviewThe systematic search spanned databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Employing terms like “Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic” and “trial,” the search focused on English full-text articles from April 1, 2010, to August 9, 2023. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies with patients having R/M AdCC, involving drug interventions. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for retrospective studies, Cochrane ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised trials, and the ROB-2 tool for randomised controlled trials.FindingsA total of 46 trials involving 1244 patients are included in this review, encompassing a variety of therapeutic approaches for R/M AdCC. Targeted therapies, particularly Apatinib at 500 mg, exhibit efficacy with a 47.1% objective response rate (ORR). Conversely, immunotherapeutic agents demonstrate suboptimal performance, with an overall ORR ranging from 0 to 18%. While Apatinib shows promise, the review underscores the imperative for a thorough exploration of drugs targeting unique mechanisms in the immunologically cold nature of R/M AdCC.Conclusions and relevanceSubstantial progress in systemic therapy for R/M AdCC is evident, driven by early-phase clinical trials, particularly with promising outcomes in VEGF-2 inhibitors. However, challenges persist, notably in immunotherapy due to the cancer’s immunologically cold nature. Ongoing research, prioritising early-stage trials, is crucial, emphasising exploration of emerging therapies like cell therapy and antibody–drug conjugates. Transitioning to Phase III trials is essential for more precise therapeutic insights. Collaborative efforts and a focus on personalised precision medicine are vital for overcoming challenges and advancing our understanding of treatment efficacy in this rare cancer.",1
"PurposeOnly a small proportion of patients obtain survival benefit from PD-1 blockade immunotherapy due to the highly heterogeneous and suppressed immune micro-environment of GBM. We aimed at revealing the characteristics of tumor micro-environment (TME) of GBM related to response to PD-1 inhibitors and constructing a response prediction model for screening patients possibly benefit from PD-1 inhibitors.MethodsBased on the composition and expression profiles of cell subpopulations calculated by deconvoluting the GBM bulk RNA-seq, differentially expressed gene analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to explore genes and pathways related to response to PD-1 inhibitors. Further by combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and expression correlation with PD-L1, the response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors were identified and the response prediction model was constructed through binary logistic regression.ResultsThe comparison of abundances of tumor infiltrating immune cells showed that the abundance of M0 macrophages of responders was lower, while the abundance of activated dendritic cells (DCs) was higher before PD-1 inhibitors treatment; the abundances of plasma cells and M0 macrophages of responders were lower after PD-1 inhibitors treatment. In addition, GSEA showed that the main up-regulation pathways in the tumor micro-environment of responders before PD-1 inhibitors treatment included the regulation of T-helper 1 type immune response, the positive regulation of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, p53 signaling pathway, homotypic cell–cell adhesion, etc., the main down-regulation pathways included the activation of microglia and myeloid leukocytes, Ras signaling pathway, etc. Afterward, ITGAX, LRRFIP1 and FMN1 were identified as the key response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors and the response prediction model based on them showed good predictive performance with potential value of clinical application in its validation and verification.ConclusionsITGAX, LRRFIP1 and FMN1 were identified as the response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors and the response prediction model based on them was proved to have potential clinical value.","AbstractObjectiveTo uncover the role of nuclear receptor-binding protein 2 (NRBP2) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and CAFmediated TAM sensitivity in breast cancer (BC).Methods10 pairs of matched tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected and CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated. CCK-8 as well as colony formation assays showed the effects on cell growth. qPCR and Immunoblot showed the expression of NRBP2 in CAFs. FCM as well as Immunoblot assays exhibited the effects on cell apoptosis. Immunoblot further confirmed the mechanism.ResultsCAFs contributed to BC cell growth. In addition, the expression of NRBP2 is downregulated in CAFs. NRBP2 suppressed CAF-induced resistance in BC cells. Further, NRBP2 expression in CAF group increased TAM induced apoptosis. Mechanically, NRBP2 in CAFs inhibited Akt pathway, therefore suppressed resistance in BC cells.ConclusionCAFs affected BC cell sensitivity to TAM by regulating NRBP2.",0
"PurposeHistory of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC) has been associated with survival following the diagnosis of a second primary malignancy (SPM), with the direction of the association varying by cancer type. Research is needed to elucidate the role of other key factors in this association.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients newly diagnosed and/or treated at Moffitt Cancer Center in December 2008–April 2020 with breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL) (n = 29,156). History of KC was obtained from new patient intake questionnaires. Age- and stage-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the association between history of KC and survival following each cancer, stratified by demographic/clinical characteristics.ResultsKC history was most prevalent in patients with melanoma (28.7%), CLL (19.8%) and lung cancer (16.1%). KC history was associated with better overall survival following prostate cancer (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55–0.99) and poorer overall survival following CLL (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.10–2.71). Patients with a history of KC experienced better survival within the first four years of a melanoma diagnosis (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92); whereas poorer survival was observed for patients who survived 7 + years after a melanoma diagnosis (HR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.17–4.05). Stratification by treatment and stage revealed directional differences in the associations between KC history and survival among patients with breast cancer and melanoma.ConclusionsKC history may be a predictor of survival following an SPM, possibly serving as a marker of immune function and/or DNA damage repair capacity.","Aim: The present investigation aimed to develop niosomes containing gold nanoparticles (Nio-AuNPs) and to evaluate the combinational effect of Nio-AuNPs and x-ray radiation therapy (XRT) on growth inhibition potential and induction of apoptosis in the A549 cell line.Materials & methods: Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized, and niosomes were prepared using the thin-film hydration method.

"ABSTRACTIntegrating nanotechnologies in diagnostic imaging presents a promising step forward compared to traditional methods, which carry certain limitations. Conventional imaging routes, such as X-ray/computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, derive significant advantages from nanoparticles (NPs), which allow researchers and clinicians to overcome some of the limitations of traditional imaging agents. In this literature review, we explore recent advancements in nanomaterials being applied in conventional diagnostic imaging techniques by exploring relevant reviews and original research papers (for example experimental models and theoretical model studies) in the literature. Collectively, there are numerous nanomaterials currently being examined for use in conventional imaging modalities, and each imaging technique has unique NPs with properties that can be manipulated to answer an array of clinical questions specific to that imaging modality. There are still challenges to consider, including getting regulatory approval for clinical research and routine use about long-term biocompatibility, which collectively emphasize the need for continued research to facilitate the integration of nanotechnology into routine clinical practice. Most importantly, there is a continued need for strong, collaborative efforts between researchers, biomedical engineers, clinicians, and industry stakeholders, which are necessary to bridge the persistent gap between translational ideas and implementation in clinical settings.","AbstractBACKGROUNDDespite progress in the treatment of brain metastasis for HER2+ breast cancer, outcomes for patients with HER2-negative breast cancer brain metastases remain poor. Preclinical studies show inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) are effective in combination with radiation therapy as a DNA damage response inhibitor. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has higher rates of homologous recombination deficiency compared to other subtypes, and together with HER2-negative, BRCA-mutated breast cancer would be particularly sensitive to PARP inhibition. PARP inhibition has also demonstrated promising efficacy combined with immunotherapy in patients with germline BRCA-mutant and metastatic TNBC in clinical trials. In addition, immunotherapy with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is associated with favorable intracranial control and survival in patients with brain metastases. We hypothesize that this biologically-driven combination will enhance local control of SRS-treated brain metastases through synergy with PARP inhibition, while controlling micrometastatic disease via potentiation of the immune response. METHODSWe are conducting a multi-institution, Phase I/II trial of SRS plus olaparib, followed by durvalumab (with physician’s choice systemic therapy), for patients with TNBC (any BRCA status) or HER2-negative with BRCA-mutated (germline or somatic) breast cancer brain metastases [NCT04711824]. A total of 41 patients are planned for enrollment at 8 sites. The primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability (Phase I) and determine intracranial disease control at 6 months (Phase II). Secondary objectives include assessing intracranial and global progression-free survival, overall survival, and intracranial and extracranial response rate. Exploratory objectives will assess potential biomarkers of treatment response, including changes in circulating tumor cells and DNA in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, germline and tumor mutations in DNA repair pathway genes, and PD-L1 expression, as well as quality of life and patient-reported outcomes. As of May 2024, phase I has been completed without dose-limiting toxicity, and phase II is currently enrolling. Funding/drug provision from AstraZeneca.",0
"AbstractBackgroundPreclinical cancer studies ascribe promising anticancer properties to metformin. Yet, clinical findings vary, casting uncertainty on its therapeutic value for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We hypothesized that metformin could benefit obese and overweight patients with NSCLC.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 2 clinical cohorts and employed complementary mouse models to test our hypothesis. One cohort included NSCLC patients with overweight body mass index (≥25 kg/m2, n = 511) and nonoverweight body mass index (<25 kg/m2, n = 232) who underwent lobectomy, evaluating metformin’s impact on clinical outcomes. Another cohort examined metformin’s effect on progression-free survival after immune checkpoint inhibitors in overweight (n = 284) vs nonoverweight (n = 184) NSCLC patients. Metformin’s effects on tumor progression, antitumor immunity, and immune checkpoint inhibitor response in obese and normal-weight mice were assessed with lung cancer models.ResultsMetformin is associated with increased recurrence-free survival in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.94; P = .035) after lobectomy. It also corrected accelerated tumor growth in diet-induced obese mouse models in a lymphocyte-specific manner while reversing several mechanisms of immune suppression potentiated by obesity. Programmed cell death 1 blockade coupled with metformin was more effective at limiting tumor burden in obese mice and correlated with progression-free survival only in overweight patients on immunotherapy (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.93; P = .024).ConclusionsMetformin may improve lung cancer–specific clinical outcomes in obese and overweight lung cancer patients and enhance immunotherapy efficacy in this growing population. This work identifies obesity as a potential predictive biomarker of metformin’s anticancer and immunotherapy-enhancing properties in lung cancer while shedding light on the underlying immunological phenomena.","PurposeTherapies targeting the immune checkpoint molecules programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) have been explored in various malignant tumours. In this study, we examined the relationship between PDL-1, IDO1 and JAK2 expression and the roles of these signal pathways in soft tissue leiomyosarcoma (LMS).MethodsThe next-generation sequencing data of 53 patients with LMS were obtained from an online public database and were used to assess PD-L1, IDO1 and JAK2 gene amplification and mRNA expression. Then, we determined the relationship between JAK–STAT pathway activation and PD-L1 and IDO1 expression in a LMS cell line. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of 69 cases of LMS was performed for PD-L1, IDO1, TDO2 and phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2).ResultsComprehensive gene expression analysis using microarray and RNA-Seq data revealed that PD-L1 and IDO1 mRNA expression positively correlated with JAK2 and STAT1 mRNA expression. Two of the 53 cases exhibited PD-L1 and JAK2 gene amplification; however, they were not related to their gene expression. LMS cell line analysis revealed that IFN-γ supplementation induced IDO1 and PD-L1 expression; these effects were suppressed by JAK inhibition. Immunohistochemical analysis of the resected specimens revealed that TDO2 expression positively correlated with pJAK2 (P = 0.0490) and IDO1 expression (P < 0.0001). PD-L1-positive specimens tended to express pJAK2; however, the relationship did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.1477).ConclusionThe results suggest the possible feasibility of the combined inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 or IDO1 with IFN-γ–JAK–STAT pathway inhibition to treat soft tissue LMS.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03390-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"IntroductionPoliovirus receptor (PVR) is a tumor promoter and a regulatory checkpoint that enhances immunosuppression. We investigated PVR expression by applying immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A positive association existed between PVR expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) expression in patients with surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PVR expression is a prognosis predictor of lung adenocarcinoma.PurposeTo investigate the prognostic significance of PVR expression and CTLA4 expression for surgically resected NSCLC.Patients and methodsThe medical records of 108 Chinese patients with primary NSCLC who underwent surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of PVR and CTLA4 were measured through IHC. Clinical characteristics, the association between PVR and CTLA4, and the prognostic significance of PVR were analyzed.ResultsA significant positive association was observed between PVR and CTLA4 expression in NSCLC (P = 0.016). PVR had a high positive rate among females, nonsmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma and advanced lung cancer. The overall survival (OS) of patients with negative PVR expression was significantly longer than that of patients with positive PVR expression (P = 0.049), especially among females (P = 0.03) and nonsmokers (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis results showed that advanced tumor stage and PVR expression were independent prognosis predictors of poor OS.ConclusionPVR can potentially serve as a prognostic predictor and biomarker for NSCLC and cancer anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03189-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Background:Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare and biologically aggressive. We sought to assess diagnostic and management strategies among the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) membership.Methods:An anonymous survey was distributed to ASBrS members from March-May 2023. The survey included questions about respondents’ demographics and information related to stage III and IV IBC management. Agreement was defined as a shared response by >80% of respondents. In areas of disagreement, responses were stratified by years in practice, fellowship training, and annual IBC patient volume.Results:The survey was administered to 2337 members with 399 (17.1%) completing all questions and defining the study cohort. Distribution of years in practice was 26.0% 0–10 years, 26.6% 11–20 years, and 47.4% >20 years. 51.2% reported surgical oncology or breast fellowship training, 69.2% maintain a breast-only practice, and 73.5% treat <5 IBC cases/year. Agreement was identified in diagnostic imaging, trimodal therapy, and mastectomy with wide skin excision for stage III IBC. Lack of agreement was identified in surgical management of the axilla; respondents with <10 years in practice or fellowship training were more likely to perform axillary dissection for cN0-N2 stage III IBC. Locoregional management of stage IV IBC was variable.Conclusions:Among ASBrS members, there is consensus in diagnostic evaluation, treatment sequencing, and surgical approach to the breast in stage III IBC. Differences exist in surgical management of the cN0–2 axilla with uptake of de-escalation strategies. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate oncologic safety of de-escalation in this high-risk population.",0
"Bacteria have been found in tumors for over 100 years, but the irreproducibility of experiments on bacteria, the limitations of science and technology, and the contamination of the host environment have severely hampered most research into the role of bacteria in carcinogenesis and cancer treatment. With the development of molecular tools and techniques (for example, macrogenomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and macrotranscriptomics), the complex relationships between hosts and different microorganisms are gradually being deciphered. In the past, attention has been focused on the impact of the gut microbiota, the site where the body’s microbes gather most, on tumors. However, little is known about the role of microbes from other sites, particularly the intratumor microbiota, in cancer. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have identified the presence of symbiotic microbiota within a large number of tumors, bringing the intratumor microbiota into the limelight. In this review, we aim to provide a better understanding of the role of the intratumor microbiota in cancer, to provide direction for future experimental and translational research, and to offer new approaches to the treatment of cancer and the improvement of patient prognosis.","BackgroundCancer, being a complex disease, presents a major challenge for the scientific and medical communities. Peptide therapeutics have played a significant role in different medical practices, including cancer treatment.MethodThis review provides an overview of the current situation and potential development prospects of anticancer peptides (ACPs), with a particular focus on peptide vaccines and peptide-drug conjugates for cancer treatment.ResultsACPs can be used directly as cytotoxic agents (molecularly targeted peptides) or can act as carriers (guiding missile) of chemotherapeutic agents and radionuclides by specifically targeting cancer cells. More than 60 natural and synthetic cationic peptides are approved in the USA and other major markets for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Compared to traditional cancer treatments, peptides exhibit anticancer activity with high specificity and the ability to rapidly kill target cancer cells. ACP's target and kill cancer cells via different mechanisms, including membrane disruption, pore formation, induction of apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and regulation of the immune system. Modified peptides have been developed as carriers for drugs, vaccines, and peptide–drug conjugates, which have been evaluated in various phases of clinical trials for the treatment of different types of solid and leukemia cancer.ConclusionsThis review highlights the potential of ACPs as a promising therapeutic option for cancer treatment, particularly through the use of peptide vaccines and peptide–drug conjugates. Despite the limitations of peptides, such as poor metabolic stability and low bioavailability, modified peptides show promise in addressing these challenges.Graphical abstractVarious mechanism of action of anticancer peptides. Modes of action against cancer cells including: inducing apoptosis by cytochrome c release, direct cell membrane lysis (necrosis), inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing autophagy-mediated cell death and immune cell regulation.",1
"Histopathology is a challenging interpretive discipline, and the level of confidence a pathologist has in their diagnosis is known to vary, which is conveyed descriptively in pathology reports. There has been little study to accurately quantify pathologists’ diagnostic confidence or the factors that influence it. In this study involving sixteen pathologists from six NHS trusts, we assessed diagnostic confidence across multiple variables and four specialties. Each case was reported by four pathologists, with each pathologist reporting each case twice (on light microscopy (LM) and digital pathology (DP)). For each diagnosis, pathologists recorded their confidence on a 7-point Likert scale. This provided 16,187 diagnoses and associated confidence scores for analysis. All variables investigated were found to be significantly predictive of diagnostic confidence, except level of pathologist experience. Confidence was lower for difficult to report cases, cases where there was inter- and intra-pathologist variation in the diagnosis, and cases where the pathologist made an incorrect diagnosis. Confidence was higher, although nominally, for LM diagnoses than DP (rate ratio 1.09 (95% CI 1.01–1.18), p = 0.035), although results indicate pathologists are confident to report on DP. Lowest confidence scores were seen in areas of known diagnostic complexity and cases with quality issues. High confidence in incorrect diagnoses were almost invariably attributed to interpretive diagnostic differences which occurred across both rare and common lesions. The results highlight the value of external quality control schemes and the benefits of selective peer review when reporting.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00428-024-03899-1.","ABSTRACTBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, but they can induce immune-related adverse events, including immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonia (CIP), a severe lung complication. CIP, particularly Grades 3–4, is associated with poor prognosis, indicating a critical need for research on this issue. Our study aimed to investigate the risk factors and biomarkers associated with severe CIP in lung cancer patients treated with ICIs, where OS represents overall survival and PFS denotes progression-free survival.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 106 lung cancer patients with CIP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 2019 to 2023, categorized into four severity grades.ResultsThe median time to onset of CIP was 5.17 months. Patients with Grade 3–4 CIP had a median PFS of 6.5 months and OS of 11.2 months. Univariate analysis identified phosphocreatine kinase below 61.5 U/l, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) below 1.96, and BMI below 21.26 as predictive factors for Grades 3–4 CIP. Multivariate analysis confirmed that a decreased FVC was a significant predictor.ConclusionsA decreased FVC below 1.96 emerged as a predictive factor for Grades 3–4 CIP, highlighting the importance of monitoring FVC in patients receiving ICIs.",0
"ABSTRACT“Inadequate understanding of chirality has potentially disastrous consequences. “Genius on the left, madman on the right” is not an exaggerated verse in the field of chiral research, but a realistic warning…”","AbstractNecroptosis, a cell death mechanism with the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. Induction of necroptosis for cancer therapy may be possible through the regulation of the expression of a key factor gene receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3 (RIPK3) via in vitro transcription (IVT) mRNA delivery. However, mRNA is susceptible to degradation and has a low delivery efficiency, which highlights the requirement of a proper delivery vehicle for intracellular delivery. Therefore, a new mRNA delivery system based on the nanostructured silica nanoparticles, termed mRNA‐protective nanocage (mPN) has been developed. High‐efficiency expression of RIPK3 and induction of necroptosis is achieved through delivery of RIPK3 IVT mRNA with mPN in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, the mPN carrying RIPK3 mRNA distributed locally in tumors upon intravascular injection, and successfully induced necroptosis and immune cell infiltration, a hallmark of necroptosis. the suppression of tumor growth in a murine cancer model, demonstrating the synergistic effect of RIPK3 mRNA‐ and immune cell‐mediated therapy is also observed. These findings suggest the potential for anticancer therapy through necroptosis induction and provide a strategy for the development of mRNA‐based nanomedicine.",1
"Background: Aspergillus has become the second most common causative agent of invasive fungal infections and is the leading cause of death from fungal infections.

Literature search using the advanced search function in WoSCC with the search formula “TS=(Aspergillus).” The inclusion criteria were as follows:  article type = article;  time span = 1975–2022;  topic = “Medical Mycology”;  research field = “Respiratory System, Internal Medicine”;  language type = English. Results: As of February 21, 2023, studies of Aspergillus in respiratory medicine included 1065 articles with 41,308 cumulative citations. The United States ranked first in terms of the highest number of publications (n = 320). Udice French Research University was the institution with the highest number of publications (n = 40). The author with the highest number of publications was Denning (n = 32). Based on the CiteSpace analysis result, the keywords with the nature of a Burst Citation were “epidemiology,” “chronic pulmonary aspergillosis,” “galactomannan,” “guideline,” “sensitization,” and “randomized trail.” Besides the keywords, it was found that as of 2022, only the topics “allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis” and “invasive pulmonary aspergillosis” are still active with a large number of papers published, according to the results of the CiteSpace analysis of the cited literature. Conclusions: The bibliometric results indicated the current hot research hotspots of Aspergillus were as follows:  research directly related to Aspergillus (epidemiology, risk factors, early diagnosis methods, and methods of novel antifungal treatment, for example, galactomannan);  studying coinfections of Aspergillus with other pathogens: For example, COVID-19 could focus on studying the immune status of patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) to guide individualized immunotherapy and individualized management of patients with CAPA.","ObjectiveTo utilize bibliometric analysis to examine the literature about immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer published within the past two decades. Through this method, we aim to visualize and analyze the research progress in this field and identify the most recent trends and developments.MethodsThis research conducted a comprehensive literature review on immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer. The time frame spanned from January 2003 to December 2022, and the data were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The application of various software tools, such as CiteSpace, Bibliometrix, and VOSviewer, facilitated the visualization and analysis of the gathered data. These technological utilities illustrated the progression of prominent focus areas within the field.ResultsAfter excluding irrelevant studies, 373 papers were selected for this study. The findings suggested that the field of immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer was rapidly developing. The USA was considered to have a significant early entrant advantage in this area and profoundly influenced the field. Similarly, China’s National Cancer center demonstrated notable advantages as a recent participant in this research domain.

"BackgroundApolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) is a family of highly efficient cytidine deaminase enzymes. APOBECs have been proven to deaminate cytidine on single-stranded DNA or RNA. Inducing the deamination of cytosine on the target gene into uracil, which exerts a variety of physiological functions, plays an important role in innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and antiviral. As the research progresses, APOBECs have been confirmed to be highly expressed in a variety of tumors, causing abnormal mutations in host genes, leading to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or activation of proto-oncogenes, and their role in tumor development and as diagnostic and treatment markers gradually be found.ConclusionThis article will review the mechanism of APOBECs and their impact on tumor occurrence, development, diagnosis, and treatment, and provide a theoretical basis for future tumor treatment.","The compounds derived from Traditional Chinese Medicines have shown various pharmacological activities with unique advantages, especially in the aspect of antitumor. Neferine (Nef), a natural compound, extracted from green seed embryos of Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) also exerts antitumor effects on cancers. In this study, the effects and mechanisms of Nef on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were evaluated. The results showed that Nef had the antitumor effects in vivo and in vitro. Nef significantly suppressed cell viability and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells, with elevated reactive oxygen species and reduced BCL2/BAX ratio. Nef was also demonstrated to inhibit the invasion, metastasis and EMT process of NSCLC cells, and attenuate EMT-related changes of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin at both transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, we concluded that the inhibitory effects of Nef on EMT was achieved by targeting Rho-associated protein kinase 1, a protein mediating the process of EMT in various cancers. These results showed that Nef had a significant antitumor effect on NSCLC cells by inducing apoptosis and blocking EMT, providing the therapeutical prospect on NSCLC treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04280-y.",0

"PurposeEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is a frequent digestive tract malignant carcinoma with a high fatality rate. Daphne altaica (D. altaica), a medicinal plant that is frequently employed in Kazakh traditional medicine, and which has traditionally been used to cure cancer and respiratory conditions, but research on the mechanism is lacking. Therefore, we examined and verified the hub genes and mechanism of D. altaica treating ESCC.MethodsActive compounds and targets of D. altaica were screened by databases such as TCMSP, and ESCC targets were screened by databases such as GeneCards and constructed the compound-target network and PPI network. Meantime, data sets between tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from GEO database (GSE100942, GPL570) were analyzed to obtain DEGs using the limma package in R. Hub genes were validated using data from the Kaplan–Meier plotter database, TIMER2.0 and GEPIA2 databases. Finally, AutoDock software was used to predict the binding sites through molecular docking.ResultsIn total, 830 compound targets were obtained from TCMSP and other databases. In addition, 17,710 disease targets were acquired based on GeneCards and other databases. In addition, we constructed the compound-target network and PPI network. Then, 127 DEGs were observed (82 up-regulated and 45 down-regulated genes). Hub genes were screened including TOP2A, NUF2, CDKN2A, BCHE, and NEK2, and had been validated with the help of several publicly available databases. Finally, molecular docking results showed more stable binding between five hub genes and active compounds.ConclusionsIn the present study, five hub genes were screened and validated, and potential mechanisms of action were predicted, which could provide a theoretical understanding of the treatment of ESCC with D. altaica.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04797-w.","PurposeProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression may influence the prognosis of patients with localized esophageal cancer. The current study compared the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression between tumor cells and immune cells.MethodsArchival esophageal tumor tissue samples were collected from patients who received paclitaxel and cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in three prospective phase II trials. PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells was examined immunohistochemically by using the SP142 antibody and scored by two independent pathologists. The association of PD-L1 expression with patient’s outcomes was analyzed using a log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis.ResultsA total of 100 patients were included. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was positive (≥ 1%, TC-positive) in 55 patients; PD-L1 expression on immune cells was high (≥ 5%, IC-high) in 30 patients. TC-positive status was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.63, P = 0.035), whereas IC-high status was associated with improved OS (HR: 0.44, P = 0.0024). Multivariate analysis revealed that TC-positive, IC-high, and performance status were independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival and that IC-high and performance status were independent factors for OS. Furthermore, the combination of IC-high and TC-negative status was associated with the optimal OS, whereas that of TC-positive and IC-low status was associated with the worst OS.ConclusionPD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells may have different prognostic value for patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving neoadjuvant CRT. A combination of these two indexes may further improve the prognostic prediction.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03772-7.",1
"Introduction: The combination of atezolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), and bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, is the first choice for systemic therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. Immune-related cardiovascular toxicity—myocarditis and pericarditis—are known to occur during ICI treatment. By contrast, VEGF inhibitors (VEGFIs) cause cardiovascular complications such as hypertension and heart failure. Thus, different cardiovascular toxicities have been recognized for ICIs and VEGFIs, but the impact of their combination remains unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the cardiovascular toxicity profile of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab using the World Health Organization adverse event reporting database—VigiBase. Methods: We analyzed data included in VigiBase till December 2022. To evaluate the frequency of reports related to atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and their combinations for 21 adverse events, we calculated the reporting odds ratio and information component. Analyses of the fatality of various cardiovascular toxicities associated with the use of each drug were performed. Results: The database included 84,951, 10,595, and 2,092 reports of treatment with bevacizumab, atezolizumab, and their combination, respectively. The disproportionality signal of hypertension, arterial embolism and thrombosis, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, heart failure, myocarditis, hemorrhage-related clinical events, venous embolism and thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure with combination regimen of atezolizumab and bevacizumab was detected. Signals of these adverse events were also detected treatment with either atezolizumab or bevacizumab alone. Venous embolism and thrombosis exhibited the highest fatality rate in the two drug combination (12.82%) relative to those of atezolizumab (6.19%) and bevacizumab (4.54%). Discussion: Cardiovascular toxicity, owing to the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, was similar to that of each single agent, and no new safety concerns were observed. Caution should be exercised when combining the two drugs since the fatality rate of thromboembolism increases with combination treatment.","Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody of VEGF, and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death function independently of the apoptotic machinery, has been accepted as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention; the ferroptosis pathway can enhance cell immune activity of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in HCC. In this study we investigated whether and how bevacizumab regulated ferroptosis and immune activity in liver cancer. Firstly, we performed RNA-sequencing in bevacizumab-treated human liver cancer cell line HepG2 cells, and found that bevacizumab significantly altered the expression of a number of genes including VEGF, PI3K, HAT1, SLC7A11 and IL-9 in liver cancer, bevacizumab upregulated 37 ferroptosis-related drivers, and downregulated 17 ferroptosis-related suppressors in particular. We demonstrated that bevacizumab triggered ferroptosis in liver cancer cells by driving VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/SLC7A11 axis. Clinical data confirmed that the expression levels of VEGF were positively associated with those of PI3K, HAT1 and SLC7A11 in HCC tissues. Meanwhile, we found that bevacizumab enhanced immune cell activity in tumor immune-microenvironment. We identified that HAT1 up-regulated miR-143 targeting IL-9 mRNA 3’UTR in liver cancer cells; bevacizumab treatment resulted in the increase of IL-9 levels and its secretion via VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/miR-143/IL-9 axis, which led to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo through increasing the release of IL-2 and Granzyme B from activated CD8+ T cells. We conclude that in addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer. This study provides new insight into the mechanisms by which bevacizumab synergistically modulates ferroptosis and CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer.",1
"BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and is characterized by high aggressiveness and rapid progression, poor treatment, high recurrence rate, and poor prognosis. Although super-enhancer (SE)-driven genes haven been recognized as prognostic markers for several cancers, whether it can be served as effective prognostic markers for patients with GBM has not been evaluated.MethodsWe first combined histone modification data with transcriptome data to identify SE-driven genes associated with prognosis in patients with GBM. Second, we developed a SE-driven differentially expressed genes (SEDEGs) risk score prognostic model by univariate Cox analysis, KM survival analysis, multivariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Its reliability in predicting was verified by two external data sets. Third, through mutation analysis, immune infiltration, we explored the molecular mechanisms of prognostic genes. Next, Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and the Connectivity Map (cMap) database were employed to assess different sensitivities to chemotherapeutic agents and small-molecule drug candidates between high- and low-risk patients. Finally, SEanalysis database was chosen to identify SE-driven transcription factors (TFs) regulating prognostic markers which will reveal a potential SE-driven transcriptional regulatory network.ResultsFirst, we developed a 11-gene risk score prognostic model (NCF2, MTHFS, DUSP6, G6PC3, HOXB2, EN2, DLEU1, LBH, ZEB1-AS1, LINC01265, and AGAP2-AS1) selected from 1,154 SEDEGs, which is not only an independent prognostic factor for patients, but also can effectively predict the survival rate of patients. The model can effectively predict 1-, 2- and 3-year survival of patients and was validated in external Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Second, the risk score was positively correlated with the infiltration of regulatory T cell, CD4 memory activated T cell, activated NK cell, neutrophil, resting mast cell, M0 macrophage, and memory B cell. Third, we found that high-risk patients showed higher sensitivity than low-risk patients to both 27 chemotherapeutic agents and 4 small-molecule drug candidates which might benefit further precision therapy for GBM patients. Finally, 13 potential SE-driven TFs imply how SE regulates GBM patient’s prognosis.ConclusionThe SEDEG risk model not only helps to elucidate the impact of SEs on the course of GBM, but also provides a bright future for prognosis determination and choice of treatment for GBM patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05121-2.","PurposeThis study aimed to develop a machine learning–based approach to identify prognostic gene signatures for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) using next-generation sequencing data from Asian populations.Materials and MethodsWe utilized next-generation sequencing data to analyze gene expression profiles and identify potential biomarkers. Our methodology involved integrating various machine learning techniques, including feature selection and model optimization. We employed logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to validate the identified gene signatures.ResultsWe identified a gene signature significantly associated with relapse in TNBC patients. The predictive model demonstrated robustness and accuracy, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9087, sensitivity of 0.8750, and specificity of 0.9231. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a strong association between the gene signature and patient relapse, further validated by logistic regression analysis.ConclusionThis study presents a novel machine learning-based prognostic tool for TNBC, offering significant implications for early detection and personalized treatment. The identified gene signature provides a promising approach for improving the management of TNBC, contributing to the advancement of precision oncology.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in India. This review explores the epidemiological trends and the landscape of systemic therapy for HCC in the Indian context, acknowledging the recent shift in etiology from viral hepatitis to lifestyle-associated factors.A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, including data from the Global Cancer Observatory and the Indian Council of Medical Research, along with a critical analysis of various clinical trials. The article investigates systemic therapies in-depth, discussing their mechanisms, efficacy, and adaptation to Indian healthcare framework.Progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of ≤0.6 compared to sorafenib, overall survival of ∼16–19 months, and objective response rate of 20–30% are the defining thresholds for systemic therapy clinical trials. Systemic therapy for advanced HCC in India primarily involves the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, and cabozantinib, with sorafenib being the most commonly used drug for a long time. Monoclonal antibodies such as ramucirumab and bevacizumab and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, are expanding treatment horizons. Lenvatinib has emerged as a cost-effective alternative, and the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. Despite these advances, late-stage diagnosis and limited healthcare accessibility pose significant challenges, often relegating patients to palliative care.Addressing HCC in India demands an integrative approach that not only encompasses advancements in systemic therapy but also targets early detection and comprehensive care models. Future strategies should focus on enhancing awareness, screening for high-risk populations, and overcoming infrastructural disparities. Ensuring the judicious use of systemic therapies within the constraints of the Indian healthcare economy is crucial. Ultimately, a nuanced understanding of systemic therapeutic options and their optimal utilization will be pivotal in elevating the standard of HCC care in India.","AbstractBackgroundEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ and EBV- primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) carry distinct mutational landscapes, but their transcriptional and epigenetic profiles have not been integrated and compared. This precludes further insights into pathobiology and molecular differences, relevant for classification and targeted therapy.MethodsTwenty-three EBV- and 15 EBV+ PCNSL, histologically classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, were subjected to RNA-sequencing and EPIC methylation arrays. Unsupervised clustering analyses were performed. Differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes were identified and integrated.ResultsTwo distinct transcriptional clusters were found, which separated EBV- and EBV+ PCNSL (P < .0001). The EBV+ transcriptional signature contained genes (GPR15, FCER2/CD23, SLAMF1/CD150) closely regulated by EBV oncogenes in B cells. Pathway enrichment analysis uncovered enhanced B-cell receptor (BCR) and WNT/beta-catenin signaling in EBV- lymphomas, whereas Interleukin-10, NOTCH, and viral life cycle pathways were upregulated in EBV+ PCNSL. Correspondingly, BCR-associated SYK kinase activity was enriched in EBV- tumors while JAK2 was overrepresented in EBV+ PCNSL. Epigenetic profiling revealed reduced global promoter methylation in EBV+ PCNSL. Two methylation clusters were recognized, which separated EBV- and EBV+ PCNSL (P < .0001). Epigenetic profiles were distinct from 2,788 other brain tumor and nonmalignant reference samples. Promoter region hypermethylation of CD79B, a BCR subunit critical for sustained proliferation in EBV- disease, highly correlated (R = −0.7) with its transcriptional downregulation in EBV+ PCNSL.ConclusionsEBV+ and EBV- PCNSL harbor distinct transcriptional and epigenetic profiles, corroborating them as distinctive biological subtypes. Uncovered differences provide novel insights into their pathobiology, may guide molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies.",0
"Aim: Studies on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related potential neurological adverse events (pNAEs) in Korean lung cancer (LC) patients are scarce. We aimed to examine ICI prescription trends from 2018 to 2022, patient characteristics and factors associated with ICI prescription or concurrent pNAEs in LC.Research design & methods: This observational, cross-sectional study of Korean LC patients investigated four ICIs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab). The annual ICI prescription rate was calculated by dividing the number of LC patients prescribed ICIs with the total annual number of LC patients. Factors associated with ICI prescriptions or concurrent pNAEs were assessed.Results: The annual ICI prescription rate increased from 3.29% to 9.74% (average: 6.20%). Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were associated with more ICI prescriptions (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.08). Targeted therapy was associated with fewer prescriptions (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.41–0.49). The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) prescription rate was higher in patients with concurrent pNAEs than those without pNAEs (53.09% vs. 50.84%), and this was associated with higher pNAEs prevalence (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03–1.18).Conclusion: ICI prescription for LC has increased in Korea, CCI and anti-PD-1 increased pNAEs prevalence.","Introduction: Pancreatic cancer, which results from the uncontrolled growth of pancreatic cells, is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. About 90% of instances of pancreatic cancer are pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and occasionally ""pancreatic cancer"" is used exclusively to describe this subtype. Nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and FOLFIRINOX are examples of modern chemotherapeutic drugs that have the ability to quickly confer resistance in pancreatic tumor cells. Therefore, in order to treat this dreadful condition, it is essential to develop more effective medicines. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) causes pancreatic cancer cells to die apoptotically. In eukaryotes, UPS is an essential mechanism for protein breakdown. Pancreatic cancer cells are more susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress) and apoptosis when treated with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that is the first in this group of drugs approved for the treatment of cancer, especially multiple myeloma. Methods: Searching through PubMed and Google Scholar and gathering data.Results: UPS is still a popular target for pancreatic cancer treatment among researchers. However, despite the favorable results of UPS-based therapies in vitro and in vivo, the clinical results are not as promising as expected.Conclusion: A deep understanding of it, is essential to achieving the maximum results. In this review, we aim to look into the UPS along with searching for the novelist therapies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma based on manipulating it.",0
"The present study reports the development of a novel nanoconjugate, NG-FACD, comprising a positively charged self-assembled nanogel (NG) derived from a peptide amphiphilic hydrogelator and a negatively charged folic acid-functionalized blue-emitting carbon dot (FACD), bound via electrostatic interactions. NG-FACD was developed to combine the advantages of the individual nanocarriers and overcome their drawbacks. The presence of folic acid enables NG-FACD to be successfully used in selective bioimaging and targeted combination therapy against folate receptor-positive (FR+) B16F10 over FR– cells. NG-FACD demonstrated improved riboflavin (RbF) and paclitaxel (PTX) loading compared to individual nanocarriers that made it ∼1.8- and 1.5-fold more cytotoxic toward FR+ B16F10 cells over RbF- and PTX-loaded individual nanocarriers. The concurrent presence of RbF and PTX on NG-FACD displayed ∼1.9–2.8-fold higher cytotoxicity than single drug-loaded individual nanocarriers and ∼3–4.5-fold higher cytotoxicity through RbF-mediated photodynamic therapy and PTX-induced chemotherapy in synergy compared to free drugs against FR+ B16F10 cells.","Exosomes continue to attract interest as a promising nanocarrier drug delivery technology. They are naturally derived nanoscale extracellular vesicles with innate properties well suited to shuttle proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. Nonetheless, their clinical utility is currently limited by several major challenges, such as their inability to target tumor cells and a high proportion of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) of the liver and spleen. To overcome these limitations, we developed “Smart Exosomes” that co-display RGD and CD47p110–130 through CD9 engineering (ExoSmart). The resultant ExoSmart demonstrates enhanced binding capacity to αvβ3 on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, resulting in amplified cellular uptake in in vitro and in vivo models and increased chemotherapeutic efficacies. Simultaneously, ExoSmart significantly reduced liver and spleen clearance of exosomes by inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis via CD47p110–130 interaction with signal regulatory proteins (SIRPα) on macrophages. These studies demonstrate that an engineered exosome drug delivery system increases PDAC therapeutic efficacy by enhancing active PDAC targeting and prolonging circulation times, and their findings hold tremendous translational potential for cancer therapy while providing a concrete foundation for future work utilizing novel peptide-engineered exosome strategies.",1
"Purpose:Despite family history being an established risk factor for prostate cancer, the role of a broader definition of family history inclusive of not just prostate cancer but other genetically related malignancies has not been investigated in the active surveillance population. Here, we evaluate the impact of an expanded definition of family history on active surveillance outcomes.Materials and Methods:Patients undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1997-2019 with detailed data available on family cancer history were identified. Primary outcome was biopsy progression-free survival, and secondary outcomes were treatment-free survival, adverse pathological features at prostatectomy, and biochemical recurrence after treatment. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.Results:Among 855 evaluable patients, 300 (35.1%) patients had any family history of prostate cancer, and 95 (11.1%) had a family history of related malignancies suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome. Family history of prostate cancer alone was not associated with biopsy progression, whereas family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome was associated with a significantly increased risk of biopsy progression (HR 1.43, 95%CI 1.01-2.02), independent of other known clinicopathological risk factors in multivariable analysis. Similarly, family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome was associated with significantly lower treatment-free survival (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.14-2.18) in multivariable analysis. No significant association was found between family history and adverse features on surgical pathology or biochemical recurrence.Conclusions:An expanded family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome is an independent predictor of biopsy progression during active surveillance. Men with such a family history may still be offered active surveillance but should be counseled regarding the higher risk of disease progression.","IntroductionWe conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between 91 inflammatory cytokines and prostate cancer (PCa).Material and methodsThe inverse variance weighted (IVW) model served as the primary two-sample MR analysis method, utilized to estimate the causal effect of exposure on the outcome. The weighted median (WM) and MR Egger methods were additionally employed to complement the IVW model. Sensitivity analyses were performed using Cochran’s Q test for both the IVW and MR Egger methods. To assess the presence of horizontal pleiotropy, the instrumental variables (IVs) were subjected to the MR-Egger intercept test.ResultsFollowing Bonferroni correction, the IVW analysis revealed positive correlations between PCa and the levels of C-C motif chemokine 20 (CCL20), C-C motif chemokine 23 (CCL23), fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Notably, IL-6 exhibited the strongest positive association effect (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.0076 [1.0014, 1.0139]), followed by CCL-20 (1.0067 [1.0004, 1.0129]) and FGF23 (1.0002, 1.0119). Reverse MR analysis indicated a negative causal relationship between PCa and interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 levels (IL22RA1) (0.4852 [0.2390, 0.9847]).ConclusionsThis study suggested that there is a positive correlation between the levels of CCL20, CCL23, FGF19, FGF23, and IL-6 and the occurrence of PCa. Furthermore, we found evidence to support the causal relationship between decreased levels of IL22RA1 and the development of PCa. These findings reveal novel biomarkers and pathways that could potentially be targeted for the prevention and clinical treatment of PCa.",1
"Aim: To investigate the prognostic value of inflammatory markers in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).Materials & methods: The infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in tissue microarrays from 180 patients who underwent radical esophagectomy was detected using immunohistochemistry. A separate cohort of 351 patients with metastatic/recurrent or unresectable ESCC treated with ICIs was enrolled for further investigation. The overall survival difference among groups was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to investigate the prognostic impact of the inflammatory markers, along with other factors.Results: Decreased inflammation was found to be associated with increased CD3+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration and a better prognosis. Then, the value of inflammatory markers in predicting survival in 351 ESCC patients receiving immunotherapy was validated. Ultimately, the systemic immune-inflammation index was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Additionally, the patients with no distant organ metastasis, or treated by first-line immunotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy can considerably prolong survival.Conclusion: Inflammation is associated with the level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and that the systemic immune-inflammation index is an effective prognostic predictor for ESCC patients treated with ICIs.","ABSTRACTEpithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a member of the small hydrophobic membrane protein subfamily. EMP1 is aberrantly expressed in various tumor tissues and governs multiple cellular behaviors (for example, proliferation, differentiation, and migration). The resultant regulation of the cancer pathway is responsible for the metastasis of cancer cells and determines the risk of malignant tumor progression. This review provides an updated overview of EMP1 as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor contingent on the cancer type and summarizes its upstream regulators and downstream target genes. This systematic review summarizes our current understanding of the role of EMP1 in malignant tumor development, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for its potential use as the biomarker and therapeutic target.",1
"Aim: In situ vaccination, a kind of therapeutic cancer vaccine, can be realized by radiotherapy and intratumoral immune injection. This study combines intratumoral injection, radiotherapy and PD-1 blockade for synergistic antitumor effect.Materials & methods: Patients with advanced solid tumors who are unresponsive or intolerant to standard treatment will be treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy, intratumoral injection of FOLactis, PD-1 blockade. The primary end point is to observe the efficacy and safety, with the secondary end point to evaluate abscopal effects and the correlation between the immunological rationale and efficacy.Discussion: The combined regimen will be utilized to trigger antitumor immunity and is expected to be feasible and effective and provide a novel option for the comprehensive treatment of cancer.Clinical Trial Registration: ChiCTR2200060660 (ChiCTR.gov.cn)","Significance:Oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation are inducers of tissue injury. Alternative splicing (AS) is an essential regulatory step for diversifying the eukaryotic proteome. Human diseases link AS to OS; however, the underlying mechanisms must be better understood.Recent Advances:Genome‑wide profiling studies identify new differentially expressed genes induced by OS-dependent ischemia/reperfusion injury. Overexpression of RNA-binding protein RBFOX1 protects against inflammation. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α directs polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 to regulate mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ceacam1) AS under OS conditions. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L variant 1 contains an RGG/RG motif that coordinates with transcription factors to influence human CEACAM1 AS. Hypoxia intervention involving short interfering RNAs directed to long-noncoding RNA 260 polarizes M2 macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype and alleviates OS by inhibiting IL-28RA gene AS.Critical Issues:Protective mechanisms that eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important for resolving imbalances that lead to chronic inflammation. Defects in AS can cause ROS generation, cell death regulation, and the activation of innate and adaptive immune factors. We propose that AS pathways link redox regulation to the activation or suppression of the inflammatory response during cellular stress.Future Directions:Emergent studies using molecule-mediated RNA splicing are being conducted to exploit the immunogenicity of AS protein products. Deciphering the mechanisms that connect misspliced OS and pathologies should remain a priority. Controlled release of RNA directly into cells with clinical applications is needed as the demand for innovative nucleic acid delivery systems continues to be demonstrated.",0
"mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are an emerging therapy validated for COVID-19 and are being evaluated to treat other diseases. However, a major limitation remains: achieving extrahepatic mRNA expression. The development of new carriers could alter biodistribution to therapeutic organs, thus expanding the utility of mRNA-based medicines. In this study we use a combination of chemostatistically-guided material synthesis and design of experiment optimization for the development of a spleen expressing lipid nanoparticle (SE-LNP). We begin with synthesis of a novel cholesterol derivative followed by SE-LNP formulation and design of experiment guided optimization to identify three lead SE-LNPs. We then evaluate their in vitro delivery mechanism, and in vivo biodistribution and protein expression in mice, ultimately achieving spleen-preferential expression. The goal of this paper is to create LNPs that preferentially deliver mRNA to the spleen upon intravenous delivery, demonstrating lipid nanoparticles’ potential to modulate gene expression in extrahepatic tissues for disease treatment.","This review article explores the potential of engineering antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for the immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases.

Additionally, challenges and future directions for the development of APC-based immunotherapies for autoimmunity – and other forms of cell-based immunotherapy – are discussed. Along this direction, this review (i) describes various strategies for engineering APCs, including genetic modification, nanoparticle delivery systems, and ex vivo manipulation techniques; (ii) discusses the selection of target antigens and the design of APC-based immunotherapies, and (iii) reviews preclinical models used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of engineered APCs in inducing antigen-specific tolerance.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a revolutionary approach in the treatment of malignancies. Despite its remarkable successes, this field continues to grapple with challenges such as scalability, safety concerns, limited therapeutic effect, in vivo persistence, and the need for precise control over CAR expression. In the post-pandemic era of COVID-19 vaccine immunization, the application of messenger RNA (mRNA) encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has recently garnered significant attention as a potential solution to address these challenges. This review delves into the dynamic landscape of mRNA-LNP technology and its potential implications for CAR-engineered immune cell-based immunotherapy.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown limited success in patients with solid tumors. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have shown that adrenoceptor beta-2 (ADRB2) is a novel checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. To inhibit ADRB2-mediated inhibitory signaling, we downregulated ADRB2 in CAR-T (shβ2-CAR-T) cells via RNA interference, assessed different parameters, and compared them with conventional second-generation CAR-T cells. ADRB2 knockdown CAR-T cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, by increasing CD69, CD107a, GzmB, IFN-γ, T-bet, and GLUT-1. In addition, ADRB2 deficiency led to improved proliferation, increased CD8/CD4 T cell ratio, and decreased apoptosis in CAR-T cells. shβ2-CAR-T cells expressed more Bcl-2 and led to the generation of more significant proportions of T central memory cells. Finally, the ZAP-70/NF-κB signaling axis was shown to be responsible for the improved functions of novel CAR-T cells. In tumor-bearing mice, shβ2-CAR-T cells performed better than conventional CAR-T cells in eradicating prostate tumors. The study provides the basis for future clinical and translational CAR-T cell research to focus on adrenergic stress-mediated challenges in the tumor microenvironment of stressed tumors.",1
"ObjectiveCurrently, there are no recognized biomarkers for predicting the immunotherapy response and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to establish an immune-related gene prognostic index (IRGPI) for HCC, and to investigate the clinical, immune, molecular, and microenvironmental characteristics of the IRGPI subgroups, as well as their impact on the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy and patients’ prognosis.MethodsWe analyzed the LIHC dataset (n = 424) from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the GSE10140 dataset (n = 84) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and univariate/multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify immune-related hub genes with prognostic significance. Subsequently, The IRGPI was then established with these special genes obtained, and the molecular, immune, and clinicopathological characteristics of the IRGPI subgroups, along with their predictive role in ICIs treatment and HCC prognosis, were investigated.ResultsThe IRGPI was composed of nine genes, namely CHGA, GAL, CCR3, MMP7, STC1, UCN, OXT, SOCS2, and GCG. The IRGPI-high group exhibited a worse prognosis in both the TCGA and GEO databases compared to the IRGPI-low group. The IRGPI-high group was primarily associated with adaptive immune response and cell–cell interaction pathways and exhibited a higher frequency of gene mutations (such as TP53 and CTNNB1), higher expression of PD-L1 and CTLA4, a higher proportion of macrophages M0 and follicular helper T cells, and a higher APC_co_inhibition and T_cell_co-inhibition immune score. Furthermore, the IRGPI-high group was associated with worse immune subtypes, clinicopathological characteristics, immunotherapy response, and clinical prognosis.ConclusionIRGPI is a biomarker with significant potential for predicting the immunotherapy response and prognosis of HCC patients, and is closely related to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and poorer clinicopathological characteristics.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04899-5.","Shotgun microbiome sequencing analysis presents several challenges to accurately and consistently depict sample composition and functional potential.

"Introduction:The accurate assessment of nodal (N) status is crucial to the management and prognostication of non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We sought to determine whether the current N descriptors should be maintained or revised for the upcoming 9th edition of the international Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) lung cancer staging system.Methods:Data was assembled by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer on patients with non-small cell lung cancer, detailing both clinical and pathologic N status, with information about anatomic location and individual station-level identification. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic groups were assessed by a Cox regression analysis.Results:Data for clinical N and pathologic N status were available in 45,032 and 35,009 patients, respectively. The current N0 to N3 descriptors for both clinical N and pathologic N categories demonstrated prognostically distinct groups. Furthermore, single station N2 involvement (N2a) demonstrated better prognosis than multistation N2 involvement (N2b) in both clinical and pathologic classifications, and the differences between all neighboring nodal subcategories were highly significant. The prognostic differences between N2a and N2b were robust and consistent across resection status, histologic type, T category, and geographic region.Conclusions:The current N descriptors should be maintained, with the addition of new sub-descriptors to N2 for single station involvement (N2a) and multiple station involvement (N2b).","PurposeThe route of lymphatic spread in esophageal cancer remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the pattern of lymphatic metastasis in its early stages.MethodsThe data were reviewed of 1074 patients who underwent curative esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and metastasis in 1–2 lymph nodes between January 2015 and December 2021. The frequencies of lymph node metastasis were analyzed by the anatomic sites and regions involved.ResultsOf the 1074 patients, 668 patients (62.2%) with one positive lymph node and 406 (37.8%) with two positive lymph nodes. Paracardial lymph nodes were the most frequently involved nodes (35.1%), followed by right thoracic recurrent nerve nodes (24.0%), middle thoracic paraesophageal nodes (14.7%), left thoracic recurrent nerve nodes (10.4%), subcarinal nodes (8.0%), lower thoracic paraesophageal nodes (7.8%), and upper thoracic paraesophageal nodes (5.7%). The frequency of lymph node metastasis in other sites was less than 3%. The majority of lymph node metastases occurred in the longitudinal direction to the perigastric (36.5%) and bilateral recurrent nerve regions (33.4%) and in the transverse direction to the paraesophageal region (27.7%). As the tumor location changed from the upper to the lower thoracic esophagus, the frequencies of lymph node metastasis decreased in the bilateral recurrent nerve region but increased in the perigastric region.ConclusionBilateral recurrent nerve nodes, paraesophageal lymph nodes, and perigastric nodes were the most common sites of early lymph node metastasis. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma involves more longitudinal than transverse lymph node metastases.",1
"The immune system is highly regulated but, when dysregulated, suboptimal protective or overly robust immune responses can lead to immune-mediated disorders. The genetic and molecular mechanisms of immune regulation are incompletely understood, impeding the development of more precise diagnostics and therapeutics for immune-mediated disorders. Recently, thousands of previously unrecognized noncanonical microprotein genes encoded by small open reading frames have been identified. Many of these microproteins perform critical functions, often in a cell- and context-specific manner. Several microproteins are now known to regulate immunity; however, the vast majority are uncharacterized. Therefore, illuminating what is often referred to as the “dark proteome,” may present opportunities to tune immune responses more precisely. Here, we review noncanonical microprotein biology, highlight recently discovered examples regulating immunity, and discuss the potential and challenges of modulating dysregulated immune responses by targeting microproteins.","Background:Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been shown to play a central role in the initiation and persistence of allergic responses.Objective:We evaluated whether tezepelumab, a human monoclonal anti-TSLP antibody, improved the efficacy of subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) and promoted the development of tolerance in patients with allergic rhinitis.Methods:We conducted a double-blind parallel design trial in patients with cat allergy. A total of 121 patients were randomized to receive either intravenous tezepelumab plus subcutaneous cat SCIT, cat SCIT alone, tezepelumab alone, or placebo for 52 weeks, followed by 52 weeks of observation. Nasal allergen challenge (NAC), skin testing, and blood and nasal samples were obtained throughout the study.Results:At week 52, the NAC-induced total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) (calculated as area under the curve [AUC0–1h] and as peak score [Peak0–1h] during the first hour after NAC) were significantly reduced in patients receiving tezepelumab/SCIT compared to SCIT alone. At week 104, one year after stopping treatment, the primary end point TNSS AUC0–1h was not significantly different in the tezepelumab/SCIT group compared to SCIT alone, while TNSS Peak0–1h was significantly lower in those receiving combination treatment versus SCIT. Transcriptomic analysis of nasal epithelial samples demonstrated that treatment with the combination of SCIT/tezepelumab, but neither monotherapy, caused persistent downregulation of a gene network related to type 2 inflammation that was associated with improvement in NAC responses.Conclusions:Inhibition of TSLP augments the efficacy of SCIT during therapy and may promote tolerance after a 1-year course of treatment.

"In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical research, the emergence of RNA-based therapeutics is paradigm shifting. It is mainly driven by the molecular adaptability and capacity to provide precision in targeting. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic crisis underscored the effectiveness of the mRNA therapeutic development platform and brought it to the forefront of RNA-based interventions. These RNA-based therapeutic approaches can reshape gene expression, manipulate cellular functions, and correct the aberrant molecular processes underlying various diseases. The new technologies hold the potential to engineer and deliver tailored therapeutic agents to tackle genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases in a highly personalized and precisely tuned manner. The review discusses the most recent advancements in the field of mRNA therapeutics for cancer treatment, with a focus on the features of the most utilized RNA-based therapeutic interventions, current pre-clinical and clinical developments, and the remaining challenges in delivery strategies, effectiveness, and safety considerations.","Background & AimsThis study assessed the prognostic value of LCR in patients with cancer-associated malnutrition (CAM). Systemic inflammatory markers, particularly the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR), are related to the survival of patients with CAM. The present retrospective analysis based on a prospective multicenter cohort study, which involved 1,437 hospitalized patients with CAM.MethodsThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ten inflammatory indicators — LCR, advanced lung cancer inflammation index, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index, modified Glasgow prognostic score, systemic immune-inflammation index, albumin-to-globulin ratio, LCR score, glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio—were constructed. Nutritional status, blood markers, and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated within 48 h of admission. The overall survival (OS) was evaluated from September 1 to December 29, 2021.ResultsA total of 1,431 cancer patients diagnosed with malnutrition based on the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Male patients were 62.8% of all, and the mean age was 60.66 years old. The AUC of LCR was higher than that of other inflammatory markers. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) of the Hazard ratios (HRs) showed an inverse L-shaped relationship with LCR. In addition, patients with low LCR had significantly poorer OS than those with high LCR. The addition of LCR to the model increased the predictive ability of 1-year mortality (AUC increase of 0.036), 3-year mortality (AUC increase of 0.038), and 5-year mortality (AUC increase of 0.031).ConclusionsAssessing the LCR can help the medical staff identify cancer patients with nutritional deficiency at high risk of oncological outcomes and develop individualized therapeutic strategies.",0
"With improved systemic treatment and prolonged survival even with metastatic disease, diagnosing, treating, and monitoring brain metastases has become a central topic in the care of patients with melanoma. Patients with brain metastases from melanoma are typically excluded from pivotal clinical trials. When allowed, inclusion and exclusion criteria are rather selective and do not reflect the larger population of melanoma patients with brain metastases who frequently present with neurological symptoms and signs and require steroid medications. Moreover, the lack of consensus on reporting symptomatic brain involvement complicates the interpretation and implications of trial results for the overall population of patients with melanoma and brain metastasis. Here, we review the evidence regarding brain metastasis from melanoma and discuss the challenges of longitudinal neurological clinical assessments, including tools to capture cognition and quality of life. Finally, we propose the adoption of standardized tools to interpret neurological deficits in patients with melanoma and brain metastases and to assess the neurological status in the context of clinical trials.","The goal of precision oncology is to translate the molecular features of cancer into predictive and prognostic tests that can be used to individualize treatment leading to improved outcomes and decreased toxicity. Success for this strategy in breast cancer is exemplified by efficacy of trastuzumab in tumors overexpressing ERBB2 and endocrine therapy for tumors that are estrogen receptor positive. However, other effective treatments, including chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and CDK4/6 inhibitors are not associated with strong predictive biomarkers. Proteomics promises another tier of information that, when added to genomic and transcriptomic features (proteogenomics), may create new opportunities to improve both treatment precision and therapeutic hypotheses. Here, we review both mass spectrometry-based and antibody-dependent proteomics as complementary approaches. We highlight how these methods have contributed toward a more complete understanding of breast cancer and describe the potential to guide diagnosis and treatment more accurately.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundTumoral melanosis (TM) is a histological term to describe a nodular aggregation of macrophages containing melanin pigment (melanophages) that is devoid of viable melanocytes. It is most often identified in skin, where it may be appreciated clinically as a pigmented lesion; however, it can also be found in other organs such as lymph nodes. The presence of TM is usually thought to signify the presence of a regressed melanoma or other pigmented tumor. Until recently, it was a relatively uncommon finding; however, with the use of effective systemic therapies against melanoma, its occurrence in histological specimens is more frequent.MethodsWe identified and reviewed all histopathological diagnoses of TM at any organ site reported at a single institution from 2006 to 2018. TM cases were paired with non‐TM cases of cutaneous melanoma through propensity score matching at a 1:2 ratio, and their survival outcomes were compared. The clinical outcomes examined included recurrence‐free survival (RFS), distant disease‐free survival (DDFS), melanoma‐specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).ResultsTM was reported in 79 patients. Their median age was 65 years (range 22–88), with a 2:1 male predominance (51 out of 79, 65%). The most common organ involved was the skin (67%), with a third of all cases localized to a lower limb (36%). TM had a strong association with the presence of melanoma (91%) and regression at other sites of melanoma (54%), suggesting that it is part of a systemic immune response against melanoma. Most patients with TM either previously or subsequently developed histologically confirmed melanoma in the same anatomical region as the TM (89%). Thirty‐five TM patients were matched with 70 non‐TM cases. Patients with melanoma who developed TM without prior regional or systemic therapy showed improved MSS (p = 0.03), whereas no statistically significant differences were observed in terms of RFS, DDFS, and OS.ConclusionsTM usually occurs in the context of a previous or subsequent cutaneous melanoma and is associated with improved MSS. It is important that TM is recognized by pathologists and documented in pathology reports.","SummaryPathologists play a central role in RCC patient care by confirming the diagnosis of malignancy, determining the histologic type of RCC, and assessing many important prognostic factors such as the pathological stage, nuclear grade, presence of sarcomatoid or rhabdoid features, and others. In recent years, our increased understanding of the molecular alterations driving specific RCC types has led to an improved classification scheme that better informs patient prognosis and treatment. In spite of this progress, no predictive biomarkers are currently approved for the management of patients with RCC. Pathologists are uniquely positioned to move the field forward by developing IHC/mIF-based predictors of outcome to ICI-based therapy that could be utilized in the clinic.",1
"The targeting and conversion of the immunosuppressive (M2) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to an immunostimulatory (M1) phenotype can induce tumor regression in advanced melanoma. We have previously characterized and reported the ability of reconstituted high-density lipoprotein nanoparticles (rHDL NPs) functionalized with DSPE-PEG-mannose (DPM) to deliver payload to macrophages. Herein, we investigate the modulation of macrophage phenotype and payload delivery mechanisms of the rHDL-DPM NPs in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages exposed to the conditioned medium (CM) from murine B16-F10 melanoma cells. The rHDL-DPM NPs loaded with the Stimulator of Interferon genes agonist, DMXAA, reduced protein levels of M2 markers. Through the mannose moiety, the rHDL-DPM-DMXAA NPs enhanced the production of interferon β and CXCL10 compared to the free DMXAA in the B16-F10 CM-educated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Compared to their non-mannosylated counterpart, the rHDL-DPM NPs delivered their payload more efficiently to the B16-F10 CM-educated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Mechanistically, both the scavenger receptor type B class 1 (SR-B1) and the mannose receptor (CD206) facilitated payload delivery to the macrophages via endocytic and non-endocytic mechanisms. Finally, the CM from rHDL-DPM-DMXAA NPs -treated macrophages enhanced paclitaxel (paclitaxel)-mediated cytotoxicity in B16-F10 cells. Together, these in vitro findings demonstrate the potential of the mannose-functionalized rHDL NPs in improving the targeting of M2-like TAMs and treatment outcomes when combined with immunotherapy or PTX in B16-F10 melanoma in vivo models.","Purpose The rise of female breast cancer has created a significant global public health issue that requires effective solutions. Disulfidptosis, a recently identified form of cell death characterized by an excessive accumulation of disulfides, has unique initiatory and regulatory mechanisms. The formation of disulfide bonds is a metabolic event typically associated with cysteines. This study aims to explore the potential of the affinity between cysteine metabolism and disulfidptosis in risk stratification for breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA).MethodsWe used correlation analysis to decipher co-relation genes between cysteine metabolism and disulfidptosis (CMDCRGs). Both LASSO regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were employed to construct the prognostic signature. Additionally, we conducted investigations concerning subtype identification, functional enhancement, mutation landscape, immune infiltration, drug prioritization, and single-cell analysis.ResultsWe developed and validated a six-gene prognostic signature as an independent prognostic predictor for BRCA. The prognostic nomogram, based on risk score, demonstrated a favorable capability in predicting survival outcomes. We identified distinct gene mutations, functional enhancements, and immune infiltration patterns between the two risk groups. Four clusters of drugs were predicted as potentially effective for patients in the low-risk group. We identified seven cell clusters within the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer, and RPL27A was found to be widely expressed in this environment.ConclusionMultidimensional analyses confirmed the clinical utility of the cysteine metabolism-disulfidptosis affinity-based signature in risk stratification and guiding personalized treatment for patients with BRCA.",0
"PurposeNRAS plays a pivotal role in progression of various kinds of somatic malignancies; however, the correlation between NRAS and lung adenocarcinoma is less known. We aim to analyze the prognostic value of NRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma, and explore the relationship between NRAS and tumor immune microenvironment.MethodsWe obtained the transcriptome profiles and clinical data of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and three Genome Expression Omnibus datasets. Specimens from 325 patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma were collected for immunohistochemical assays of NRAS, PD-L1, PD-1 and TIM-3. Then, we performed gene set enrichment analysis to investigate cancer-related and immune-related signaling pathways. TIMER algorithms were performed to evaluate tumor immune infiltrating cells and immune-related biomarkers.ResultsCompared with adjacent non-tumor tissue, NRAS expression was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissue. NRAS expression was significantly correlated with more advanced stage and positive lymph nodes. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox analysis suggested that high NRAS expression led to a poor prognosis, and could be an independent prognostic factor in LUAD patients. Besides, NRAS expression was positively correlated with CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, and negatively correlated with B cells and CD4+ T cells. The expression level of NRAS was positively correlated with PD-L1, PD-1, and TIM-3 both at RNA and protein level.ConclusionsTo conclude, we found NRAS is a novel prognostic biomarker in LUAD. Besides, the expression level of NRAS may influence the prognosis of LUAD via various kinds of cancer-related pathways and remodeling TIM.","BackgroundBrain metastases (BMs) are the most common intracranial tumors among adults, which exceed primary brain tumors by far. Surgery and radiotherapy represent the key local management of BM. However, the exact role of surgery is still under debate.ObjectiveTo comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical management in patients with brain metastases.MethodsWe searched four electronic databases from January 2023 until September 2024 (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library). All the studies assessing the role of surgery in managing BM were included. Our primary search targets were survival, mortality, and postoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). The results were reported as pooled mean or proportions with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous and dichotomous data, respectively.ResultsEight observational studies comprising 1010 patients met our inclusion criteria. The pooled mean of overall survival was 10.482 with 95% CI [7.651, 13.314]. While the pooled proportion of one-year and two-year survival was (0.451, 95% CI [0.320, 0.582]) and (0.240, 95% CI [0.112, 0.367]), respectively. We found the pooled proportion of overall mortality to be 0.535 with 95% CI [0.278, 0.793]. Patients with immediate postoperative KPS improvement showed a pooled estimate of 0.463 with 95% CI [0.243, 0.683].ConclusionSurgical resection is an effective therapeutic option for patients with BMs. Yet, careful patient selection and surgical technique are crucial for reducing postoperative complications and death.",0
"BackgroundCD177, an indicator of prognosis in diverse cancers, is involved in the physiological processes of various tumor cells, and acts as an immune molecule with novel functions in cancer pathogenesis. However, the diagnostic, prognostic, and immunological role of CD177 in cervical cancer remains unclear.MethodsUtilizing publicly available databases and integrating several bioinformatics analysis methods, we evaluated the expression level of CD177 in cervical cancer by GENT2, HPA, and GEO databases. And the experiments of western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to test the hypothesis. The Kaplan–Meier Plotter database, Xena Shiny, and the constructed nomogram were clearly demonstrated its prognostic value for patients. Gene set enrichment analysis explored the relationship between CD177 and cervical cancer immune responses and immune cells infiltration level. In addition, we investigated the association between CD177 expression and stromal score, immune score, immune checkpoint, and drug sensitivity by TCGA RNA-seq data.ResultsCD177 was apparently expressed at low levels in cervical cancer and predicted a poor survival rate for patients. CD177 significantly activated immune-related signaling pathways and had a positive relationship with immune cell infiltration level. The high CD177 expression group possessed the high stromal score and immune score. CD177 had potential interactions with CTLA4, CD27, BLTA, CD200R1, CD80, NRP1, TNFRSF25, TIGIT, ICOS, and TNFSF9 checkpoint markers. And CD177 expression was positively relevant with drug sensitivity for Lapatinib, Belinostat, ATRA, Gefitinib, Navitoclax, and Tamoxifen.SignificanceThese findings may shed light on the vital role of CD177 in cervical cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and immunological functions, and it may be a promising predictor and potential factor for cervical cancer patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04465-5.","Dysregulation of gene amplification, cell-signaling–pathway transduction, epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, and protein interactions drives tumor-cell proliferation and invasion, while ion channels also play an important role in the generation and development of tumor cells. Overexpression of Ca2+-activated Cl- channel anoctamin 1 (ANO1) is shown in numerous cancer types and correlates with poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms involved in ANO1-mediated malignant cellular transformation and the role of ANO1 in tumor immunity remain unknown. In this review, we discuss recent studies to determine the role of ANO1 in tumorigenesis and provide novel insights into the role of ANO1 in the context of tumor immunity. Furthermore, we analyze the roles and potential mechanisms of ANO1 in different types of cancers, and provide novel notions for the role of ANO1 in the tumor microenvironment and for potential use of ANO1 in clinical applications. Our review shows that ANO1 is involved in tumor immunity and microenvironment, and may, therefore, be an effective biomarker and therapeutic drug target.",1
"The utilization of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, specifically anti-PD-1/L1 agents, prior to radical cystectomy is an emerging paradigm in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). In situ vaccination represents a strategy to manipulate the tumor in order to augment the immune response toward improved local and distant cancer control. The authors describe the study rationale, design and objectives for RAD VACCINE MIBC, a single-arm, single-institution, phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of combination neoadjuvant sasanlimab (humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1) with stereotactic body radiotherapy as an in situ vaccine in cisplatin-ineligible patients with MIBC. The results from this trial will establish the safety profile of this combination strategy and evaluate pathologic complete response rates.","Background:There is a growing literature base regarding menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination among premenopausal people. However, relatively little is known about uterine bleeding in postmenopausal people following COVID-19 vaccination.Objectives:To examine trends in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses over time before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction and describe cases of new-onset postmenopausal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design:All analyses focused on members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest ages 45 and older who were diagnosed with incident postmenopausal bleeding in the electronic medical record. Members with pre-existing postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding, or who were at increased risk of bleeding due to other health conditions, were excluded. We used segmented regression analysis to estimate changes in the incidence of postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses from 2018 through 2021 in Kaiser Permanente Northwest members meeting inclusion criteria, stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status in 2021. Additionally, we identified all members with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccination between December 14, 2020, through August 14, 2021, who had an incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnosis within 60 days of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination, diagnostic procedures, and presumed bleeding etiology were assessed through chart review and described. A temporal scan statistic was run on all cases without clear bleeding etiology.Results:In a population of approximately 80,000 individuals per month there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction (p=0.59). Among 48,438 vaccinated individuals, 104 had postmenopausal bleeding first diagnosed within 60 days following COVID-19 vaccination; 76% of cases (79/104) were confirmed as post-vaccination postmenopausal bleeding after chart review. Median time from vaccination to bleeding onset was 21 days (range: 2–54 days). Among the 56 postmenopausal bleeding cases with a provider-attributed etiology, the common causes of bleeding were uterine or cervical lesions (50% [28/56]), hormone replacement therapy (13% [7/56]), and proliferative endometrium (13% [7/56]). Among the 23 cases without a clear etiology, there was no statistically significant clustering of postmenopausal bleeding onset following vaccination.Conclusions:Within this integrated health system, introduction of COVID-19 vaccines was not associated with an increase in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses. Diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding in the 60 days following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination was rare.",0
"Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid for the growth and survival of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Many cancers are addicted to glutamine, and as a result, targeting glutamine metabolism has been explored clinically as a therapeutic approach. Glutamine-catalyzing enzymes are highly expressed in primary and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the nature of the glutamine-associated pathways in this aggressive cancer type has not been elucidated. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential of a broad glutamine antagonist, DRP-104 (sirpiglenastat), in HNSCC tumors and aimed at shedding light on glutamine-dependent pathways in this disease. We observed a potent antitumoral effect of sirpiglenastat in HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC xenografts. We conducted a whole-genome CRISPR screen and metabolomics analyses to identify mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to glutamine metabolism blockade. These approaches revealed that glutamine metabolism blockade results in the rapid buildup of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via autophagy nutrient-sensing pathways. Finally, our analysis demonstrated that GPX4 mediates the protection of HNSCC cells from accumulating toxic lipid peroxides; hence, glutamine blockade sensitizes HNSCC cells to ferroptosis cell death upon GPX4 inhibition. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of sirpiglenastat in HNSCC and establish a novel link between glutamine metabolism and ferroptosis, which may be uniquely translated into targeted glutamine-ferroptosis combination therapies.","BackgroundThis study aims at screening and validation of prospective genetic signature for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) prognosis and treatment.MethodsThe immune-related genes (IRGs) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset where a total of 535 LUAD and 59 control samples were included. A risk model was then developed for the risk stratification of LUAD patients. The immune cell infiltration, clinical outcomes, and the therapeutic efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) blockade were compared between high and low-risk groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to explore the biological processes and signalling pathways associated with the IRGs. Finally, IRGs mRNA levels were assayed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in LUAD and relevant cell lines.ResultsTwo IRGs, P2RX1 (purinergic receptor P2X 1) and PCP4 (Purkinje cell protein 4), were screened from a module that possesses the highest correlation with plasma cells. RT-qPCR verified the expression of the two IRGs in plasmacytoma cell RPMI 8226 but not in LUAD cells. A higher risk score is associated with a lower infiltration of immune cells. Kaplan–Meier and nomogram analysis showed that the high-risk group has a lower survival rate than the low-risk cohort. Furthermore, the high-risk group had a worse response rate to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade. GSVA and GSEA-GO results indicated that a lower risk score is linked to signalling pathways and biological functions promoting immune response and inflammation. In contrast, a higher risk score is associated with signalling cascades promoting tumour growth.ConclusionThe immune-related prognostic model based on P2RX1 and PCP4 is conducive to predicting the therapeutic response of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade and clinical outcomes of LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05153-8.",0
"ObjectivesThe project is designed to compare the clinical efficacy and adverse events resulting from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).MethodsPubMed Database and ClinicalTrials.gov were both searched to identify randomized controlled clinical trials for assessing ICIs in all-stage SCLC. After screening in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible studies were evaluated in regard to the population, intervention, comparator, outcome as well as study design (PICOS) pattern. Furthermore, primary endpoints of these randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and complete/objective response rate (CRR/ORR). Statistical analyses were realized via Review Manager Version 5.3 Software.ResultsCompared with the chemotherapy alone group, the ICIs plus chemotherapy group significantly improved with respect to such indicators as OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.90, P < 0.0001), PFS (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.87, P < 0.00001) and ORR (64.7% versus 59.1%). According to the safety analysis, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) at all grades was higher in ICIs plus chemotherapy group (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.20–2.10, P = 0.001), bearing no statistical significance at grade 3 or above (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.99–1.49, P = 0.07).ConclusionsThe combination of ICIs and chemotherapy witnessed better anti-neoplastic efficacy for SCLC. Moreover, the incidence of trAEs at all grades was elevated in ICIs plus chemotherapy group, with little discrepancy in both groups at grade 3 or above.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The introduction of biologics, particularly anti-interleukin (IL) agents, has revolutionized IBD treatment. This review summarizes the role of ILs in IBD pathophysiology and describes the efficacy and positioning of anti-IL therapies. We discuss the functions of key ILs in IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets. The review then discusses anti-IL therapies, focusing primarily on ustekinumab (anti-IL-12/23), risankizumab (anti-IL-23), and mirikizumab (anti-IL-23). Clinical trial data demonstrate their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The safety profiles of these agents are generally favorable. However, long-term safety data for newer agents are still limited. The review also briefly discusses emerging therapies such as guselkumab and brazikumab. Network meta-analyses suggest that anti-IL therapies perform well compared to other biological agents. These agents may be considered first- or second-line therapies for many patients, especially those with comorbidities or safety concerns. Anti-IL therapies represent a significant advancement in IBD treatment, offering effective and relatively safe options for patients with moderate to severe disease.",0
"PurposeTo investigate whether attenuated Toxoplasma is efficacious against solid tumors of pancreatic cancer and whether attenuated Toxoplasma improves the antitumor activity of αPD-1 antibody on pancreatic cancer.MethodsThe therapeutic effects of attenuated Toxoplasma NRTUA strain monotherapy and combination therapy of NRTUA with anti-PD-1 antibody on PDAC tumor volume and tumor weight of Pan02 tumor-bearing mice were investigated. We characterized the effects of combination therapy of NRTUA with anti-PD-1 antibody on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-specific IFN-γ by using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and ELISA. The antitumor mechanisms of combination therapy of NRTUA with anti-PD-1 antibody were investigated via depletion of CD8+ T cells and IL-12.ResultsNRTUA strain treatment inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous mouse model of PDAC through activating dendritic cells and increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. More importantly, combination therapy of NRTUA with anti-PD-1 antibody elicited a significant antitumor immune response and synergistically controlled tumor growth in Pan02 tumor-bearing mice. Specifically, the combination treatment led to elevation of CD8+ T cell infiltration mediated by dendritic cell-secreted IL-12 and to tumor-specific IFN-γ production in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Also, the combination treatment markedly reduced the immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cell population in PDAC mice.ConclusionThese findings could provide a novel immunotherapy approach to treating solid tumors of PDAC and overcoming resistance to anti-PD-1 agents in PDAC tumors.","PurposeThe expression of cytochrome B561 (CYB561) and its role in breast cancer (BC) prognosis remain unclear. We analyzed the differential expression and prognostic value of CYB561 using online databases and a clinical cohort through bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry.MethodsThe differential expression of CYB561 and its association with BC were analyzed using the tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER), gene expression profiling interaction analysis2 (GEPIA2), Human Protein Atlas, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and Kaplan–Meier Plotter website. Important pathways of CYB561 enrichment were explored using gene set enrichment analysis. Immunohistochemistry detected CYB561 expression in normal breast, breast hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), para-cancer, and invasive BC groups. Association between CYB561 expression and BC prognosis was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses.ResultsCYB561 mRNA expression was higher in GEPIA and TIMER BC patients than in para-cancer tissues. CYB561 was expressed in the glandular epithelium and myoepithelium, with positive localization in the cytoplasm and cell membrane. CYB561 protein expression significantly differed among the groups. CYB561 expression was correlated with ERBB2/HER2 and infiltrating CD4+ T cells in GEPIA and TIMER BC patients and associated with HER2 status, histological grade, and molecular subtypes in the clinical cohort but not related to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

Patients with CYB561 expression had significantly reduced overall survival and increased risk of death.ConclusionCYB561 can serve as an effective clinical prognostic biomarker for BC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03928-z.",0
"PurposeThere is uncertainty regarding the role of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).MethodsWe identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICIs combined with NACT to NACT in early-stage TNBC. Efficacy outcomes included pathological complete response (pCR) and event-free survival (EFS). Toxicity data included any grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, AEs leading to death, common and meaningful AEs associated with chemotherapy and immune-related AEs. Odds ratio (ORs), hazard ratios (HR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) for efficacy and toxicity were extracted and pooled in a meta-analysis. Differences in the odds for pCR between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status and between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors were also assessed.ResultsFive RCTs comprising 2,075 patients were analyzed. Compared to NACT alone, combination of ICIs and NACT significantly improved pCR (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25–2.47, p = 0.001) and EFS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48–0.91, p = 0.01). Magnitude of effect on pCR was similar between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors (p for the subgroup difference = 0.80) and between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors (p = 0.27). The combination treatment resulted in higher odds of any grade 3/4 AEs (OR 1.31, p = 0.02) and serious AEs (OR 1.84, p = 0.006), with no statistically significant difference in AEs leading to death (OR 1.67, p = 0.51). Higher magnitude of toxicity was observed for immune-related AEs.ConclusionCombination of ICIs and NACT were associated with improved outcome in early-stage TNBC while increasing toxicity significantly. Longer follow-up is desired to better understand the risk and benefit ratio of this combination.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03591-w.","BackgroundTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that exhibits elevated glycolytic capacity. Lactate, as a byproduct of glycolysis, is considered a major oncometabolite that plays an important role in oncogenesis and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. However, the potential roles of lactate in TNBC are not yet fully understood. In this study, our goal was to identify prognosis-related lactate genes (PLGs) and construct a lactate-related prognostic model (LRPM) for TNBC.MethodsFirst, we applied lactate-related genes to classify TNBC samples using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Then, we performed the log-rank analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis to screen PLGs and construct the LRPM. The biological functions of the identified PLGs in TNBC were investigated using CCK8 assay and clone formation assay. Finally, we constructed a nomogram based on the lactate-risk score and tumor clinical stage. We used the operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis to evaluate the predictive capability of the nomogram.ResultsOur results showed that the TNBC samples could be classified into two subgroups with different survival probabilities. Three genes (NDUFAF3, CARS2 and FH), which can suppress TNBC cell proliferation, were identified as PLGs. Moreover, the LRPM and nomogram exhibited excellent predictive performance for TNBC patient prognosis.ConclusionWe have developed a novel LRPM that enables risk stratification and identification of poor molecular subtypes in TNBC patients, showing great potential in clinical practice.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05171-6.",1
"ABSTRACTBackgroundThis study analyzed the application of dual bronchodilators in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) & chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during the perioperative period.Research design and methodsA total of 100 patients with moderate to severe COPD who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy were divided into two groups. The patients in the observation group (group O) were treated with umeclidinium/vilanterol and conventional treatment (oxygen therapy, assisted expectoration, respiratory rehabilitation training) during the perioperative period. The patients in the control group (group C) received conventional treatment. Lung function, arterial blood gas values, quality of life, postoperative adverse reactions, days of postoperative chest tube placement and hospitalization were assessed.ResultsBefore surgery, group O presented higher FEV1, FVC, PEF and MVV, elevated PO2 and reduced PCO2, lower CAT scores compared with the group C (p < 0.05). The group O demonstrated fewer perioperative adverse reactions, and shorter days of postoperative chest tube and hospitalization compared with the group C (p < 0.05).ConclusionsPerioperative inhalation of umeclidinium/vilanterol can effectively protect arterial blood gas and respiratory function in patients with LC complicated with COPD.","Purpose:Young adult cancer survivors experience disruptions in various life domains (for example, relationships, academic/career) during and after treatment. This study examined life disruptions and related supports to update interventions to improve psychological outcomes.Methods:In April–July 2023, young adult survivors (n = 23) were recruited (via clinics, support groups, nonprofit organizations, etc.) to complete semi-structured interviews assessing cancer’s impact across life domains, how they coped with related disruptions, and facilitators to improved psychosocial well-being. We used a dual deductive–inductive approach to develop a codebook and then coded transcripts in Dedoose.Results:This sample was on average 33.7 years old (standard deviation [SD] = 4.4), 78.3% female, 73.9% non-Hispanic White, 47.8% married/cohabitating, 2.4 (SD = 1.0) years post-diagnosis, 1.4 years (SD = 0.9) post-treatment, and largely diagnosed with breast cancer (52.1%) or leukemia/lymphoma (34.7%). The most salient themes related to disruptions included mental health, feelings of isolation during survivorship, and disruptions to career and relationships with family or partners. Participants reported challenges navigating these feelings and disruptions, and difficulty understanding and conveying their needs. Many experienced limited support for navigating cancer-related trauma and life disruptions as a survivor. Participants also reported some positive impacts, like reevaluating their values and goals or feeling resilient, and emphasized the need to identify supports, accept that life had changed because of cancer, and have their needs and continued struggles validated by others during survivorship.Conclusions:Young adults experience ongoing disruptions across multiple life domains, underscoring the need for integrated, longer-term psychosocial supports to help them navigate these disruptions and reevaluate their goals.",1
"IntroductionThe aim of this study was to investigate the role of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis and to develop a nomogram for predicting HCC prognosis.Method In this study, 1066 HCC patients were enrolled between August 2018 and April 2022. TK1 levels were measured within one week before enrollment, and the relationship with HCC prognosis was evaluated. Next, all patients were randomly assigned to the training set (70%, n = 746) and the validation set (30%, n = 320). We used multivariate Cox analysis to find independent prognostic factors in the training set to construct a nomogram. The predictive power of the nomogram was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The optimal critical value of TK1 was determined as 2.35 U/L using X-tile software.ResultBefore and after propensity score matching (PSM), the median overall survival (mOS) of the low-TK1 group (< 2.35 U/L) remained significantly longer than that of the high-TK1 group (≥ 2.35 U/L) (48.1 vs 16.5 months, p < 0.001; 75.7 vs 19.8 months, p = 0.001). Moreover, multivariate Cox analysis showed that the low TK1 level was an independent positive prognostic indicator. Additionally, the area under the ROC curve for predicting the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates was 0.770, 0.758, and 0.805, respectively.ConclusionsTK1 could serve as a prognostic marker for HCC. In addition, the nomogram showed good predictive capability for HCC prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05089-z.","BackgroundCOVID-19 has created a significant risk to worldwide public health. According to recent research, C-type lectins may be SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Layilin (LAYN), a broadly expressed integral membrane hyaluronan receptor with a C-type lectin structural domain, is a gene related to cell senescence. There are a few studies on C-type lectins in pan-cancer, and no pan-cancer analysis has been conducted for LAYN. MethodsThe genotype tissue expression (GTEx) portal and the cancer genome map (TCGA) database were used to collect samples from healthy and cancer patients. Bioinformatics methods are used to construct immune landscape, mutation landscape, and stemness landscape of LAYN. The single-cell sequencing data were used from the CancerSEA website to analyze the functions of LAYN. The prognosis potential of LAYN was discussed based on machine learning.ResultsLAYN is differentially expressed among cancers. Survival analysis indicated that LAYN was related to a poor overall survival (OS) rate in cancers, like HNSC, MESO, and OV. Mutational landscapes of LAYN in SKCM and STAD were constructed. LAYN was negatively related to Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) in THCA, PRAD, and UCEC, and with the Microsatellite Instability (MSI) in STAD, LUAD, and UCEC. The immune landscape in pan-cancer suggested that LAYN may be involved in tumor immune escape. LAYN plays a crucial role in the infiltration of immune cells in malignant tumors. LAYN participates in methylation modifications and affects tumor proliferation and metastasis by regulating stemness. Analysis of single-cell sequencing data suggests that LAYN may participate in several biological processes, like stemness, apoptosis, and DNA repair. LAYN transcript was predicted as a liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS)-related RNA. The results of KIRC were verified in the GEO and ArrayExpress databases. Furthermore, prognostic models based on machine learning of LAYN-related genes were established. Hsa-miR-153-5p and hsa-miR-505-3p may be the upstream miRNAs of LAYN and have a high value for tumor prognosis.ConclusionThis study elucidated the functional mechanisms of LAYN from a pan-cancer perspective and provided novel insights into cancer prognosis, metastasis, and immunotherapy. LAYN has the potential to become a new target of mRNA vaccines and molecular therapies in tumors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04986-7.",1
"Key Points•CD38-CAR NK and T cells showed enhanced killing toward CD38-expressing hematologic malignancies.•ATRA upregulates CD38, enhancing the activity of CD38-CAR NK cells against resistant CD38-low tumor cells.","BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and is characterized by high aggressiveness and rapid progression, poor treatment, high recurrence rate, and poor prognosis. Although super-enhancer (SE)-driven genes haven been recognized as prognostic markers for several cancers, whether it can be served as effective prognostic markers for patients with GBM has not been evaluated.MethodsWe first combined histone modification data with transcriptome data to identify SE-driven genes associated with prognosis in patients with GBM. Second, we developed a SE-driven differentially expressed genes (SEDEGs) risk score prognostic model by univariate Cox analysis, KM survival analysis, multivariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Its reliability in predicting was verified by two external data sets. Third, through mutation analysis, immune infiltration, we explored the molecular mechanisms of prognostic genes. Next, Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and the Connectivity Map (cMap) database were employed to assess different sensitivities to chemotherapeutic agents and small-molecule drug candidates between high- and low-risk patients. Finally, SEanalysis database was chosen to identify SE-driven transcription factors (TFs) regulating prognostic markers which will reveal a potential SE-driven transcriptional regulatory network.ResultsFirst, we developed a 11-gene risk score prognostic model (NCF2, MTHFS, DUSP6, G6PC3, HOXB2, EN2, DLEU1, LBH, ZEB1-AS1, LINC01265, and AGAP2-AS1) selected from 1,154 SEDEGs, which is not only an independent prognostic factor for patients, but also can effectively predict the survival rate of patients. The model can effectively predict 1-, 2- and 3-year survival of patients and was validated in external Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Second, the risk score was positively correlated with the infiltration of regulatory T cell, CD4 memory activated T cell, activated NK cell, neutrophil, resting mast cell, M0 macrophage, and memory B cell. Third, we found that high-risk patients showed higher sensitivity than low-risk patients to both 27 chemotherapeutic agents and 4 small-molecule drug candidates which might benefit further precision therapy for GBM patients. Finally, 13 potential SE-driven TFs imply how SE regulates GBM patient’s prognosis.ConclusionThe SEDEG risk model not only helps to elucidate the impact of SEs on the course of GBM, but also provides a bright future for prognosis determination and choice of treatment for GBM patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05121-2.",0
"AbstractTraditional vaccines have played an important role in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, but they still have problems such as low immunogenicity, poor stability, and difficulty in inducing lasting immune responses. In recent years, the nucleic acid vaccine has emerged as a relatively cheap and safe new vaccine. Compared with traditional vaccines, nucleic acid vaccine has some unique advantages, such as easy production and storage, scalability, and consistency between batches. However, the direct administration of naked nucleic acid vaccine is not ideal, and safer and more effective vaccine delivery systems are needed. With the rapid development of nanocarrier technology, the combination of gene therapy and nanodelivery systems has broadened the therapeutic application of molecular biology and the medical application of biological nanomaterials. Nanoparticles can be used as potential drug-delivery vehicles for the treatment of hereditary and infectious diseases. In addition, due to the advantages of lung immunity, such as rapid onset of action, good efficacy, and reduced adverse reactions, pulmonary delivery of nucleic acid vaccine has become a hot spot in the field of research. In recent years, lipid nanocarriers have become safe, efficient, and ideal materials for vaccine delivery due to their unique physical and chemical properties, which can effectively reduce the toxic side effects of drugs and achieve the effect of slow release and controlled release, and there have been a large number of studies using lipid nanocarriers to efficiently deliver target components into the body. Based on the delivery of tuberculosis (TB) nucleic acid vaccine by lipid carrier, this article systematically reviews the advantages and mechanism of liposomes as a nucleic acid vaccine delivery carrier, so as to lay a solid foundation for the faster and more effective development of new anti-TB vaccine delivery systems in the future.","Aim: To evaluate the anti-pancreatic cancer effect of novel Tubeimoside I multifunctional liposomes combined with gemcitabine.Methods: Liposomes were prepared through the thin film hydration method, with evaluations conducted on parameters including encapsulation efficiency (EE%), particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), storage stability, and release over a 7-day period. The cellular uptake rate, therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo and the role of immune microenvironment modulation were evaluated.Results: The novel Tubeimoside I multifunctional liposomal exhibited good stability, significant anti-cancer activity, and immune microenvironment remodeling effects. Furthermore, it showed a safety profile.Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of Novel Tubeimoside I multifunctional liposomal as a promising treatment option for pancreatic cancer.",1
"The dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), which may result from genomic alterations or modulation by upstream effectors, is implicated in cancer oncogenesis and progression. CDK12 overexpression or activation is sufficient to induce tumor initiation, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance. However, CDK12 may also exert tumor-suppressive functions in a context-dependent manner. Therefore, caution is warranted when targeting CDK12 in future clinical trials. A comprehensive elucidation of the dual roles and underlying mechanisms of CDK12 in carcinogenesis is urgently needed to advance precision oncology. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the dysregulation and biological roles of CDK12 in cancer. Subsequently, we systematically summarize the functions and mechanisms of the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles of CDK12 in different contexts. Finally, we discuss the potential of CDK12 as a novel therapeutic target and its implications in clinical oncology, offering insights into future directions for innovative cancer treatment strategies.","PurposeLocally advanced papillary thyroid cancer (LAPTC) has poor prognosis. Large-scale genomic testing has revealed multiple oncogenic drivers which may be essential for understanding tumor progression. However, the accurate identification of high recurrence risk and poor prognosis in thyroid carcinoma remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze genetic profile and clinicopathologic features of locally advanced papillary thyroid cancers. MethodsAn observational cohort study was performed to identify molecular characteristics of LAPTC and a prognosis comparison of LAPTC with different genetic mutations. ThyroSeq v2 next-generation sequencing (57-gene panel) was performed on fresh tumor tissue. Then, the clinicopathological features between tumors with different genetic mutations were compared. Additionally, correlations of tumor recurrence and disease free survival with different genetic alterations were analyzed. ResultsThis study showed that the main mutation is common BRAFV600E (66.2%, 43/65) in LAPTC, followed by the TERT promoter mutations (38.5%, 25/65). Synergetic mutations of BRAFV600E and TERT promoters (B&T) were identified in 26.2% LAPTC (17/65), which is associated with tall-cell variant, extrathyroidal invasion and advanced tumor stage (III/IV). The synergetic mutations of B&T are also significantly associated with higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 6.0; 95% confidence interval, CI 1.26–28.55, P = 0.02) and mortality (17.6%, 3/17). ConclusionsSynergetic mutations of B&T are common in LAPTC, which is associated with the aggressive clinicopathologic features and an increased risk of recurrence and mortality. This finding may help to predict aggressive behavior of LAPTC and to assist in clinical decision-making.",0
"PurposeAmong soft tissue sarcomas, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) has relatively higher potential of recurrence and metastasis. As serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is associated with tumor progression and unfavorable outcomes in multiple malignancies, we designed this study to explore the relationship between preoperative serum LDH and prognosis in UPS patients.MethodsWe extracted the data of UPS patients who underwent primary surgery in Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to figure out the best cutoff value of LDH to classify them into high- or low-expression groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression to identify independent prognostic factors. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to compare differences in overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) between patients with high- or low-serum LDH.ResultsMultivariate analyses demonstrated that preoperative serum LDH was an independent factor for OS. Kaplan–Meier curves showed that patients with relatively high-serum LDH (P = 0.0004) had poorer OS compared with those with low-serum LDH. There was a trend that patients with relatively high-serum LDH had poorer TTR than those without (P = 0.1249). In addition, there were obvious trends that patients with decreased serum LDH after surgery showed better OS (P = 0.0954) and TTR (P = 0.1720) than those with elevated serum LDH. Moreover, high preoperative serum LDH was associated with female patients (P = 0.0004), positive margin (P < 0.0001), worse survival (P = 0.0061), higher mitotic index (P = 0.0222) and necrosis (P = 0.0225).ConclusionsPreoperative serum LDH is an independent factor for OS in UPS patients, and it correlates with future surgical margin.",ABSTRACTMedulloblastoma (MB) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in children. MB originates from neural precursor cells in distinctive regions of the rhombic lip and their maturation occurs in the cerebellum or the brain stem during embryonal development. Autophagy is also referred to as self-eating’ which is a catabolic process that often triggers cellular homeostasis through the salvaging of degenerated proteins as well as organelles. Autophagy influence cell survival via aberrant proteins that could accumulate within the cell and influence potential signaling and transport mechanisms. The role of autophagy in MB aggressiveness as well as tumorigenesis is a very complex process. This review targets specifically data reporting the key roles of autophagy in the pathogenesis and therapy of MB.,0
"Primary melanoma of the oral cavity is extremely rare, accounting for 0.2–8% of all melanomas. Lesions arising from mucosal melanocytes occur most frequently on the gingiva or palate. Mucosal melanomas carry a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanomas. Very few studies have been published due to rarity of disease. 46 year old lady presented with black colored lesion over left side of her tongue for 6 weeks. On examination there was 3 × 2.5 cm black colored patch over left lateral part of tongue in middle 1/3rd, not crossing midline. Tip and base of tongue were free. Biopsy was suggestive of malignant melanoma of tongue. Patient underwent surgery (wide local excision of left lateral border of tongue lesion + left selective neck dissection). Final Histopathological report revealed malignant melanoma of tongue with all margins free, Depth of invasion 3 mm, Lympho-vascular invasion present, and no perineural invasion, left level III cervical lymph node metastases. Patient thus received adjuvant RT. Immunotherapy was also advised in multidisciplinary clinic, but patient was non-compliant. Early diagnosis will be promoted by careful oral examination and early biopsy of pigmented and non-pigmented masses. Early diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis of patients with oral malignant melanoma.","PurposeTumor spread through air space (STAS) is a novel pattern of invasion related to poor prognosis in non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, little is known about the role of STAS in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We sought to determine whether STAS has a significant effect on recurrence among SCLC patients.MethodsWe collected clinical and follow-up information from 181 resected stage I–III SCLC patients and compared overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the patients with or without STAS using the Kaplan‒Meier method. To explore the effect of STAS on recurrence, a competing-risk analysis was conducted.ResultsAmong 181 SCLC patients, STAS was observed in 56 (30.94%) patients, and 125 (69.06%) patients did not have STAS. Furthermore, 33 (18.23%) patients had recurrence, including 12 patients with brain metastases. Patients with STAS had worse DFS. The cumulative incidence of any recurrence was higher in patients with STAS than in those without STAS. Univariate and multivariate competing-risk regression analyses revealed that sublobar resection and STAS were independent risk factors for SCLC recurrence (p = 0.009 and p = 0.029 for multivariate analysis, respectively).ConclusionSCLC patients with STAS have worse DFS than SCLC patients without STAS. STAS is an independent prognostic factor in SCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04462-8.",1
"Purpose:Less invasive decision support tools are desperately needed to identify occult high-risk disease in men with prostate cancer (PCa) on active surveillance (AS). For a variety of reasons, many men on AS with low- or intermediate-risk disease forgo the necessary repeat surveillance biopsies needed to identify potentially higher-risk PCa. Here, we describe the development of a blood-based immunocyte transcriptomic signature to identify men harboring occult aggressive PCa. We then validate it on a biopsy-positive population with the goal of identifying men who should not be on AS and confirm those men with indolent disease who can safely remain on AS. This model uses subtraction-normalized immunocyte transcriptomic profiles to risk-stratify men with PCa who could be candidates for AS.Materials and Methods:Men were eligible for enrollment in the study if they were determined by their physician to have a risk profile that warranted prostate biopsy. Both training (n = 1017) and validation cohort (n = 1198) populations had blood samples drawn coincident to their prostate biopsy. Purified CD2+ and CD14+ immune cells were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and RNA was extracted and sequenced. To avoid overfitting and unnecessary complexity, a regularized regression model was built on the training cohort to predict PCa aggressiveness based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network PCa guidelines. This model was then validated on an independent cohort of biopsy-positive men only, using National Comprehensive Cancer Network unfavorable intermediate risk and worse as an aggressiveness outcome, identifying patients who were not appropriate for AS.Results:The best final model for the AS setting was obtained by combining an immunocyte transcriptomic profile based on 2 cell types with PSA density and age, reaching an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.69-0.77). The model significantly outperforms (P < .001) PSA density as a biomarker, which has an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.65-0.73). This model yields an individualized patient risk score with 90% negative predictive value and 50% positive predictive value.Conclusions:While further validation in an intended-use cohort is needed, the immunocyte transcriptomic model offers a promising tool for risk stratification of individual patients who are being considered for AS.","Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer with a very poor prognosis in which less than 6% of patients survive more than five-year post-diagnosis. The outcome of this disease for many patients may be improved by early detection. This could provide clinicians with the information needed to take early action for treatment. In this work, we present the utilization of a non-invasive, fully volumetric ultrasonic imaging method to assess microvascular change during the evolution of glioblastoma in mice. Volumetric ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) was used to observe statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the appearance of functional vasculature over the course of three weeks. We also demonstrate evidence suggesting the reduction of vascular flow for vessels peripheral to the tumor. With an 82.5% consistency rate in acquiring high-quality vascular images, we demonstrate the possibility of volumetric ULM as a longitudinal method for microvascular characterization of neurological disease.",0
"ABSTRACTThe host ESCRT-machinery repairs damaged endolysosomal membranes. If damage persists, selective macroautophagy/autophagy clears the damaged compartment. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that damages the phagosomal membrane and targets ESCRT-mediated repair as part of its virulence program. The E3 ubiquitin ligases PRKN and SMURF1 promote autophagic capture of damaged, Mtb-containing phagosomes. Because ubiquitination is a reversible process, we anticipated that host deubiquitinases (DUBs) would also be involved. Here, we screened all predicted mouse DUBs for their role in ubiquitin targeting and control of intracellular Mtb. We show that USP8 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 8) colocalizes with intracellular Mtb, recognizes phagosomal membrane damage, and is required for ESCRT-dependent membrane repair. Furthermore, we show that USP8 regulates the NFE2L2/NRF2-dependent antioxidant signature. Taken together, our study demonstrates a central role of USP8 in promoting Mtb intracellular growth by promoting phagosomal membrane repair, limiting ubiquitin-driven selective autophagy, and reducing oxidative stress.Abbreviation: BMDMs: bone marrow-derived macrophages; CFUs: colony-forming units; DUB: deubiquitinase; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; LLOMe: L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester; MFI: mean fluorescence intensity; MOI: multiplicity of infection; Mtb: Mycobacterium tuberculosis; NFE2L2/NRF2: nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; PMA: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ROS: reactive oxygen species; USP8: ubiquitin specific peptidase 8","IntroductionIn RCC, systematic procedures such as surgery, chemo-radiation therapy, and application of target-based inhibitors increase the risk of several comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest that may increase the mortality rate. Even though immune-based checkpoint inhibitor therapies have an overall good response rate, it is restricted to only 30–40% of patients. Hence, an in-depth study of tumor pathophysiology in RCC is needed to identify the new therapeutic target. In RCC, persisted hypoxia is an essential phenomenon for tumor growth and progression. KCMF1 is a newly identified ubiquitin ligase whose domain interacts with destabilized proteins and reprogrammed the ubiquitin coding for lysosome-mediated degradation and autophagy under hypoxic conditions/oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis. But in RCC, the functional role of KCMF1 remains undefined to date. MethodWe determined KCMF1 and its associated proteins RAD6 and UBR4 expression and their co-localization using confocal microscopy in tumor and non-tumor tissues samples. Further, immunofluorescence staining was performed to determine autophagy (LC3B, p62), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1A) and ion channel markers (Kv1.3, KCNN4) in RCC patients (n−10). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICPMS) was performed to estimate the concentration of potassium (K+), sodium (Na+) and Zinc (zn2+) in tumor and non-tumor cells of RCC patients (n−20). Lastly, images were analyzed using ZEN3.1, and ImageJ software.Result and conclusionWe observed a discrepancy in the formation of ubiquitin ligase, autophagosome via KCMF1, and ionic concentration in tumor cells, which might be one of the possible factors for cancer evolution. KCMF1-associated ubiquitin ligase system could be considered as a novel therapeutic target for RCC in the future.",1
"Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2) has emerged as a significant target in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. The screening of patients positive for CLDN18.2 is crucial for the effective application of targeted therapies specific to CLND18.2. In this study, we developed a novel nanobody-based probe, [99mTc]Tc-PHG102, for use in nuclear medicine. We analyzed its radiochemical yield and stability to ensure accurate probe characterization. Additionally, we assessed the probe’s affinity and specificity toward the CLDN18.2 target and evaluated its efficacy in the BGC82318.2 xenograft model for SPECT/CT imaging of gastric cancer. The binding of [99mTc]Tc-PHG102 to HEK-293T18.2 and BGC82318.2 cells was notably higher than its binding to HEK-293T18.1, HEK-293T, and BGC823 cells, with bound values of 12.87 ± 1.46%, 6.16 ± 0.34%, 1.25 ± 0.22%, 1.14 ± 0.26%, and 1.32 ± 0.07% AD, respectively. The binding ability of [99mTc]Tc-PHG102 was significantly different between CLDN18.2-positive and negative cells (P < 0.001). Imaging results demonstrated a time-dependent tumor accumulation of the radiotracer. Notably, at 0.5 h postinjection, rapid accumulation was observed with an average tumor uptake of 4.63 ± 0.81% ID/cc (n = 3), resulting in clear tumor visualization. By 1 h postinjection, as [99mTc]Tc-PHG102 was rapidly metabolized, a decrease in uptake by other organs was noted. Preliminary clinical imaging trials further confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the probe, indicating specificity for lesions expressing CLDN18.2 in gastric cancer and favorable in vivo metabolic properties. In conclusion, the nanobody-based probe [99mTc]Tc-PHG102 proves to be a safe and effective tool for detecting CLDN18.2 expression levels in gastric cancer tumors and for screening CLDN18.2-positive patients.","Activation of natural killer (NK) cells with the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12, IL-15, and IL-18 induces their differentiation into memory-like (ML) NK cells; however, the underlying epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms are unclear. By combining ATAC-seq, CITE-seq, and functional analyses, we discovered that IL-12/15/18 activation results in two main human NK fates: reprogramming into enriched memory-like (eML) NK cells or priming into effector conventional NK (effcNK) cells. eML NK cells had distinct transcriptional and epigenetic profiles and enhanced function, while effcNK cells resembled cytokine-primed cNK cells. Two transcriptionally discrete subsets of eML NK cells were also identified, eML-1 and eML-2, primarily arising from CD56bright or CD56dim mature NK cell subsets, respectively. Furthermore, these eML subsets were evident weeks after transfer of IL-12/15/18-activated NK cells into cancer patients.

"AbstractCytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an uncommon but deadly side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are presently an increasingly important therapy option for malignant tumors, but there are limited treatments available for CRS. We present a case of a 72-year-old man who received one cycle of ICI coupled with cisplatin and albumin-binding paclitaxel therapy for a locally advanced right lung adenocarcinoma. Following an abrupt onset of dyspnea, the patient underwent a quick physical examination, blood tests and was diagnosed with CRS. After prompt initiation of glucocorticoid pulse treatment, the symptoms relieved. The case illustrates the management of severe CRS following ICI therapy while highlighting the uncommon and potentially fatal immune-related side effects.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors have markedly transformed cancer treatment paradigms but are frequently associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) affecting multiple organ systems. Among the rare and severe complications is the “triple M syndrome”, encompassing myositis, myocarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.We present the case of an 83-year-old male with stage IIc melanoma who received pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy following surgical excision of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes, with no evidence of neoplastic invasion. Approximately one month post-infusion, the patient experienced episodes of syncope, leading to the diagnosis of a second-degree atrioventricular block. Despite normal findings on echocardiography, the patient subsequently developed profound proximal muscle weakness, dysphonia, and dysphagia. Pembrolizumab was promptly discontinued, and the patient was initiated on high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone; however, his clinical course rapidly deteriorated, culminating in the necessity for palliative care due to progressive respiratory failure.This case underscores the potential for severe, life-threatening irAEs associated with pembrolizumab therapy, particularly in the form of triple M syndrome. Notably, the manifestations of myocarditis and myasthenia gravis (MG) within this context may occur in the absence of typical autoantibody markers, thereby complicating the diagnostic process and contributing to poor prognostic outcomes. This case highlights the imperative for heightened clinical vigilance and a proactive approach to monitoring for irAEs in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Early recognition, coupled with the prompt initiation of therapeutic interventions, is paramount in mitigating morbidity and improving clinical outcomes in these critical scenarios.",1
"Atherosclerosis is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases with a high global prevalence. It is characterized by the formation of lipid-laden plaques in the arteries, which eventually lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis. While the current lipid-lowering therapies are generally effective in lowering the risk of cardiovascular events, they do not address the underlying causes of disease. Defective resolution of inflammation and impaired efferocytosis are the main driving forces of atherosclerosis. Macrophages recognize cells for clearance by the expression of “eat me” and “do not eat me” signals, including the CD47-SIRPα axis. However, the “do not eat me” signal CD47 is overexpressed in atherosclerotic plaques, leading to compromised efferocytosis and secondary necrosis. In this context, prophagocytic antibodies have been explored to stimulate the clearance of apoptotic cells, but they are nonspecific and impact healthy tissues. In macrophages, downstream of signal regulatory protein α, lie protein tyrosine phosphatases, SHP 1/2, which can serve as effective targets for selectively phagocytosing apoptotic cells. While increasing the efferocytosis targets the end stages of lesion development, the underlying issue of inflammation still persists. Simultaneously increasing efferocytosis and reducing inflammation can be effective therapeutic strategies for managing atherosclerosis. For instance, IL-10 is a key anti-inflammatory mediator that enhances efferocytosis via phosphoSTAT3 (pSTAT3) activation. In this study, we developed a combination nanotherapy by encapsulating an SHP-1 inhibitor (NSC 87877) and IL-10 in a single nanoparticle platform [(S + IL)-NPs] to enhance efferocytosis and inflammation resolution. Our studies suggest that (S + IL)-NPs successfully encapsulated both agents, entered the macrophages, and delivered the agents into intracellular compartments. Additionally, (S + IL)-NPs decreased inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory markers and enhancing anti-inflammatory mediators. They also exhibited the potential for improved phagocytic activity via pSTAT3 activation. Our nanomedicine-mediated upregulation of the anti-inflammatory and efferocytic responses in macrophages shows promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis.","Vascular dysfunction has emerged as a significant risk factor for the development of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), which are currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. T lymphocytes (T cells) have been shown to be important modulators of vascular function in primary aging and CVDs, likely by producing inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species that influence vasoprotective molecules. This review summarizes the role of T cells on vascular function in aging, hypertension, and atherosclerosis in animals and humans, and discusses potential T-cell targeted therapeutics to prevent, delay, or reverse vascular dysfunction.",1
"PurposeThe effect of immuno-chemotherapy on patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring oncogenic mutations remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the efficacy of immuno-chemotherapy and determine the optimal treatment strategy for such patients.MethodsWe conducted this retrospective cohort study on patients with NSCLC harboring oncogenic driver alterations and treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy at five institutions. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of immuno-chemotherapy for NSCLC with oncogenic mutations in a real-world setting were analyzed.ResultsAmong 846 patients diagnosed with advanced or recurrent NSCLC between April 2017 and April 2021, 43 patients with oncogenic mutations were treated with immuno-chemotherapy. The median age of patients was 68 (range 44–78) years; 42% of patients never smoked, and adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (95%). In patients with KRAS mutations (n = 10) or PD-L1 expression of 50% or greater (n = 10), the disease control rate was 100%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.4, 6.3, and 8.9 months in patients harboring mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and other genes, respectively (P = 0.22). Patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or greater had significantly longer median PFS than patients with PD-L1 expression of less than 50% (16.4 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.001). Two patients experienced grade 3 immuno-related adverse events.ConclusionImmuno-chemotherapy has a clinical benefit and is safe for patients with oncogenic mutations. Notably, patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or more experience greater benefit from immuno-chemotherapy than those with PD-L1 expression of less than 50%.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04125-8.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent a major advance in the treatment of cancer. Most studies of ICI have underestimated their cardiotoxicity; however, an increasing number of cases of cardiotoxicity are being reported. Herein we discussed a 67-year-old, male, Japanese patient who presented with cardiogenic shock accompanied by sick sinus syndrome 4 days into his second course of ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination therapy. A temporary transvenous pacemaker was subsequently placed, and a permanent pacemaker was implanted for persistent, symptomatic, intermittent bradycardia. The permanent implantation of the pacemaker improved his symptoms and allowed him to continue his ICI therapy.",1
"Aims: Anemia, mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width may have some effects on survival outcomes of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients and are incorporated in a red blood cell (RBC)-based score. Its validity in prognostication of mRCC patients treated with second-line nivolumab was assessed.Patients and methods: Retrospective analysis using Meet-URO-15 cohort of mRCC patients receiving nivolumab in the second-line setting or beyond. Outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).Results: A total of 390 patients were included. Significant differences in OS and PFS between RBC-based score groups, with group 1 (2 or 3 of the RBC-related prognostic factors) having longer OS (median 29.5 months, 95% CI: 23.1–35.9, versus 11.5 months, 95% CI: 8.5–22.6; p < 0.001) and PFS (7.5 months, 95% CI: 5.5–10.2, versus 4.2 months, 95% CI: 3.3–5.9; p = 0.040) than those in group 0 (0 or 1 RBC-related prognostic factors). Belonging to group 1 independently predicted OS (hazard ratio: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50–0.85; p = 0.002) but not PFS (hazard ratio: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.70–1.14, p = 0.370) or disease response (OR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.41–1.10; p = 0.118) at multivariable analysis.Conclusion: RBC-based group scores independently predicted OS in mRCC patients treated with nivolumab.","PurposeGiven that prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differs dramatically, it is imperative to uncover effective and available prognostic biomarker(s). The intratumor microbiome plays a significant role in the response to tumor microenvironment, we aimed to identify an intratumor microbiome signature for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients accurately and investigate its possible mechanisms subsequently.MethodsThe TCGA HCC microbiome data (TCGA-LIHC-microbiome) was downloaded from cBioPortal. To create an intratumor microbiome-related prognostic signature, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to quantify the association of microbial abundance and patients’ overall survival (OS), as well as their diseases specific survival (DSS). The performance of the scoring model was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Based on the microbiome-related signature, clinical factors, and multi-omics molecular subtypes on the basis of “icluster” algorithm, nomograms were established to predict OS and DSS. Patients were further clustered into three subtypes based on their microbiome-related characteristics by consensus clustering. Moreover, deconvolution algorithm, weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to investigate the potential mechanisms.ResultsIn TCGA LIHC microbiome data, the abundances of 166 genera among the total 1406 genera were considerably associated with HCC patients’ OS. From that filtered dataset we identified a 27-microbe prognostic signature and developed a microbiome-related score (MRS) model. Compared with those in the relatively low-risk group, patients in higher-risk group own a much worse OS (P < 0.0001). Besides, the time-dependent ROC curves with MRS showed excellent predictive efficacy both in OS and DSS. Moreover, MRS is an independent prognostic factor for OS and DSS over clinical factors and multi-omics-based molecular subtypes. The integration of MRS into nomograms significantly improved the efficacy of prognosis prediction (1-year AUC:0.849, 3-year AUC: 0.825, 5-year AUC: 0.822). The analysis of microbiome-based subtypes on their immune characteristics and specific gene modules inferred that the intratumor microbiome may affect the HCC patients’ prognosis via modulating the cancer stemness and immune response.ConclusionMRS, a 27 intratumor microbiome-related prognostic model, was successfully established to predict HCC patients overall survive independently. And the possible underlying mechanisms were also investigated to provide a potential intervention strategy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04962-1.",0
"ABSTRACTObjectivesTo evaluate the effects of CALM intervention on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), and heart rate variability (HRV) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.MethodsA total of 153 NSCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to the CALM group and usual care (UC) group. Patients in the CALM group were received 6 CALM intervention sessions over a 12-week period and evaluated using CRF, QOL and HRV at baseline (T0) and after 2, 4, and 6 intervention sessions.ResultsThe CALM group showed significant differences in total CRF, behavioral/daily life CRF, emotional/affective CRF, sensory/physical CRF, cognitive CRF and QOL before and after CALM intervention sessions (F = 643.47, F = 208.34, F = 354.52, F = 285.69, F = 334.29, F = 245.77, p < 0.001). The CALM group showed significant increases in standard deviation of normal R-R interval (SDNN) and high-frequency power (HF) (z = −4.94, p < 0.001,z = −4.30, p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were observed between CRF and SDNN, HF and QOL across all participants.ConclusionsThe CALM intervention had a positive impact on overall physical and mental health, fatigue reduction, quality of life and autonomic dysfunction in NSCLC patients. Heart rate variability may serve as an observational indicator of physical and mental health.","AbstractBACKGROUNDReplication-repair deficiency (RRD) stemming from mismatch repair and polymerase proofreading gene defects (MMRD/PPD) lead to hypermutant childhood cancers, most frequently brain tumors. While medulloblastoma is reported, the clinical, genomic and immune landscape remains unknown. METHODSWe analysed the genome, methylome, transcriptome (bulk, single-nuclei) and immune-microenvironment of the largest cohort of RRD-medulloblastoma patients enrolled by the International RRD Consortium and correlated these to clinical outcomes. RRD mice-models were used to preclinically assess response to immunotherapy. Results: RESULTSRRD-medulloblastoma (n=43) were enriched for anaplasia (61%) and localised disease (77%). Methylation/nano-string-based subgrouping failed to classify 40%, while the remaining clustered with the SHH-subgroup. Copy-number changes were notably infrequent (<20%). All tumors harboured hypermutation and microsatellite instability in contrast to non-RRD controls (p<0.0001). Pathogenic variants were frequent in POLE/POLD1 (80%), TP53 (48%) and SHH-pathway genes (PTCH1, SUFU, SMO: 56%). Interestingly, some tumors additionally had glioma-driver alterations (ATRX, NF1: ~50%), similar to RRD cerebellar glioblastoma, but distinct from both non-RRD medulloblastoma (n=791) and hemispheric glioblastoma (n=733) controls. Moreover, although bulk-transcriptome matched non-RRD SHH medulloblastoma, single-nuclei analyses suggested an earlier cell-of-origin potentially explaining the heterogenous phenotypes resulting from the driver mutations. Uniquely, immune analyses (gene expression and immunohistochemistry) demonstrated high intra-tumoral CD8 T-cell infiltration. Three-year progression-free survival was 60%. Outcome was worse for RRD-medulloblastoma harbouring TP53-mutation (p=0.04) and failing subgroup-classification (p=0.004). Nestin/Cre MSH2-/- POLE;p.S459F mice developing medulloblastoma recapitulated human disease and demonstrated response to anti-PD1 monotherapy. Recurrent/progressive human tumors including those harbouring TP53-mutations exhibited radiological responses to anti-PD1 monotherapy, which was associated with prolonged ongoing survival in comparison to those not treated with checkpoint-inhibitors (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONSHypermutant RRD-medulloblastoma reveal heterogenous phenotypes due to unique spectrum of driver mutations and an early cell of origin. Their immune-hot microenvironment allows successful salvage treatment with checkpoint-inhibitors for those failing chemo-radiation, including the high-risk SHH/TP53-mutant and unclassified subgroups.",0
"N6 methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), has been extensively studied in recent years. Dysregulation of m6A and its associated machinery (including “writers”, “erasers” and “readers”) has been frequently observed in various cancer types, and their dysregulation profiles may serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers. The dysregulated m6A modifiers have been shown to function as oncogenes or tumour suppressors, and play essential roles in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, metabolism, drug resistance, and immune evasion, as well as in cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumour microenvironment, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the dysregulated m6A machinery for cancer treatment. In this review, we illustrate the mechanisms by which m6A modifiers interplay and orchestrate the fate of target RNAs. We also describe the state-of-the-art methodologies for mapping global m6A in cancer epitranscriptomes. We further summarize the recent discoveries regarding the dysregulations of m6A and the associated machinery in cancers and their pathological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms in cancers. Finally, we discuss the findings on m6A related molecules as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers, as well as the recent development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting oncogenic m6A modifiers and their preclinical results in treating cancers.","AbstractThe emergence of organoids is considered a revolutionary model, changing the landscape of traditional translational research.

"IntroductionGround glass opacity featured lung adenocarcinomas (GGO-LUAD) display more indolent biological behavior than solid nodule featured lung adenocarcinomas (SN-LUAD) and have an excellent prognosis. However, the cellular immune characteristics of GGO-LUAD remain poorly understood.MethodsImmunohistochemistry technique was performed to stain related immune markers (CD8, CD103, CD20, CD138, CD4, FOXP3, CD68, CD163, PD-1 and PD-L1) and TGF-β from 15 patients with pure GGO-LUAD and 15 patients with SN-LUAD tissue sections (Paired cohort), and then, the related markers with significant differences were verified on 10 patients (Verified cohort) with both pure GGO-LUAD and SN-LUAD. For localization analysis of CD68 + tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and FOXP3 + Terg cells in tumor areas, pure GGO-LUAD and SN-LUAD were also stained for simultaneous detection of pan-CK, CD68 and FOXP3 by multiplex immunofluorescence.ResultsIn the Paired cohort, compared with SN-LUAD, only the infiltration of TAMs and Treg cells was significantly lower in GGO-LUAD. The infiltration of the remaining immune cells including CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, CD103 + T cells, CD20 + B cells and CD138 + Plasma cells in GGO-LUAD, although relatively low, was not significantly different. Meanwhile, the expression of TGF-β was significantly higher in SN-LUAD. And the above results have also been confirmed in the Verified cohort. Moreover, there was no significantly difference in PD-L1 expression in GGO-LUAD compared to SN-LUAD both in the Paired cohort and Verified cohort.ConclusionsGGO-LUAD demonstrates an overall less active immune landscape as compared with SN-LUAD. TAMs and TGF-β may play an important role in the progression of GGO-LUAD. More importantly, PD-L1 expression in GGO-LUAD is comparable to that in SN-LUAD, indicating that there may be other reasons for the insensitivity of GGO-LUAD to immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04289-3.","PurposeEwing sarcoma (ES) is one of the most common malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents. The immune microenvironment plays an important role in the development of ES. Here, we developed an optimal signature for determining ES patient prognosis based on immune-related genes (IRGs).MethodsWe analyzed the ES gene expression profile dataset, GSE17679, from the GEO database and extracted differential expressed IRGs (DEIRGs). Then, we conducted functional correlation and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses of the DEIRGs and used the machine learning algorithm-iterative Lasso Cox regression analysis to build an optimal DEIRG signature. In addition, we applied ES samples from the ICGC database to test the optimal gene signature. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regressions on clinicopathological characteristics and optimal gene signature to evaluate whether signature is an important prognostic factor. Finally, we calculated the infiltration of 24 immune cells in ES using the ssGSEA algorithm, and analyzed the correlation between the DEIRGs in the optimal gene signature and immune cells.ResultsA total of 249 DEIRGs were screened and an 11-gene signature with the strongest correlation with patient prognoses was analyzed using a machine learning algorithm. The 11-gene signature also had a high prognostic value in the ES external verification set. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that 11-gene signature is an independent prognostic factor. We found that macrophages and cytotoxic, CD8 T, NK, mast, B, NK CD56bright, TEM, TCM, and Th2 cells were significantly related to patient prognoses; the infiltration of cytotoxic and CD8 T cells in ES was significantly different. By correlating prognostic biomarkers with immune cell infiltration, we found that FABP4 and macrophages, and NDRG1 and Th2 cells had the strongest correlation.ConclusionOverall, the IRG-related 11-gene signature can be used as a reliable ES prognostic biomarker and can provide guidance for personalized ES therapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03396-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"Pyroptosis-related genes have great potential for prognosis, an accurate prognostic model based on pyroptosis genes has not been seen in Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD). Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms of gene expression characteristics and the Tumor Immune Microenvironment associated with the prognosis of COAD is still largely unknown. Constructing a prognostic model based on pyroptosis-related genes, and revealing prognosis-related mechanisms associated with the gene expression characteristics and tumor microenvironment. 59 pyroptosis-related genes were collected. The gene expression data and clinical data of COAD were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. External validation datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. 10 characteristic genes with prognostic values were obtained using univariate and LASSO Cox. 10-gene Riskscore prognostic model was constructed. Both gene set enrichment analysis and network propagation methods were used to find pathways and key genes leading to different prognostic risks. The area under the ROC curves were used to evaluate the performance of the model to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients, the results were 0.718, 0.672, and 0.669 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival times. A nomogram based on Riskscore and clinical characteristics showed the probability of survival at 1, 3, and 5 years, and the calibration curves showed good agreement between the predicted and actual observations, its C-index is 0.793. The decision curves showed that the net benefit of the nomogram was significantly superior to that of the other single variables. Four key pathways leading to different prognostic risks were obtained. Six key genes with prognostic value, significant expression differences (P < .05) and significant survival differences (P < .05) between high/low risk groups were obtained from the gene set of all 4 key pathways. This study constructed a prognostic model for COAD using 10 pyroptosis-related genes with prognostic value. This study also revealed significant differences in specific pathways and the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) between the high-risk group and the low-risk group, highlighted the roles of ALDH5A1 and Wnt signaling in promoting COAD and the suppressive effects of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway and RORC on COAD.

"IntroductionMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, treatment-resistant tumor. Anoikis is a particular type of programmed apoptosis brought on by the separation of cell–cell or extracellular matrix (ECM). Anoikis has been recognized as a crucial element in the development of tumors. However, few studies have comprehensively examined the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in malignant mesothelioma.MethodsARGs were gathered from the GeneCard database and the Harmonizome portals. We obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the GEO database. Univariate Cox regression analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were utilized to select ARGs associated with the prognosis of MPM. We then developed a risk model, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves were employed to confirm the ability of the model. The patients were divided into various subgroups using consensus clustering analysis. Based on the median risk score, patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups. Functional analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were conducted to estimate molecular mechanisms and the immune infiltration landscape of patients. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis and tumor microenvironment landscape were further explored.ResultsA novel risk model was constructed based on the six ARGs. The patients were successfully divided into two subgroups by consensus clustering analysis, with a striking difference in the prognosis and landscape of immune infiltration. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that the OS rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than the high-risk group. Functional analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis showed that high- and low-risk groups had different immune statuses and drug sensitivity.ConclusionsIn summary, we developed a novel risk model to predict MPM prognosis based on six selected ARGs, which could broaden comprehension of personalized and precise therapy approaches for MPM.","ABSTRACTMetastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can present with oligometastatic disease and/or develop oligoprogression following systemic therapy. Cytoreductive and focal metastasis-directed therapy options include resection, stereotactic ablative radiation and thermal ablation. Aggressive focal therapy may allow delay in initiation of or modification to systemic therapy and improve clinical outcomes. In this narrative review we synthesize current practice guidelines and prospective data on focal therapy management options and highlight future research. Patient selection and the choice of focal treatment techniques are controversial due to limited and heterogeneous data and patients may benefit from multidisciplinary evaluation. Prospective comparative trials with clearly defined inclusion criteria and relevant end points are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of different approaches.",0
"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway regulates proliferation, survival and metabolism, and its dysregulation is one of the most frequent oncogenic events across human malignancies. Over the last two decades, there has been significant focus on the clinical development of PI3K pathway inhibitors. More than 40 different inhibitors of this axis have reached various stages of clinical trials, but only a few of them have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer treatment. These clinical results, however, could be improved given the importance of PI3K signaling in cancer and its role in linking cancer growth with metabolism. In this systematic review, after a glance at PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and its different inhibitors, we retrieved registered clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors on Clinicaltrials.gov. Following the extraction of the data, finally we analyzed 2250 included studies in multiple steps, beginning with an overview and moving on to the details about type of malignancies, inhibitors, and treatment strategies. We also took a closer look at more than 100 phase III-IV clinical trials to pinpoint promising therapies, hoping that presenting a comprehensive picture of current clinical trials casts a flash of light on what remains to be done in future clinical trials of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in human malignancies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05277-x.","Recent advances in single-cell transcriptome sequencing and computational analysis methods have improved our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. However, associating different cell subsets with phenotypes remains challenging. Recently, Ren and others introduced PENCIL, a supervised learning framework incorporating gene selection to discern phenotype-relevant cells. To assess PENCIL’s reproducibility and transferability, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation across 12 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets representing four distinct phenotypes. We identified a few caveats with the original version of PENCIL, such as sensitivity to input perturbation, the correction of which contributed to PENCIL’s enhanced reproducibility. We highlight that boosting PENCIL’s cell subsets identification with gene set variation analysis creates a cytotoxic T cell immunotherapy response signature (CyTIR) predictive of immune checkpoint blockade response in skin cancer across multiple datasets, with an area under curve >0.75 and accuracy >0.71. Overall, our assessments enhance PENCIL’s reproducibility and utility, further extending its potential for identifying phenotype-relevant cell subsets in diverse biomedical applications.",0
"PurposeHuman endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is a leucine kinase receptor that is closely related to cell growth and differentiation. It is very weakly expressed in a few epithelial cells in normal tissue. Abnormal expression of HER2 usually leads to sustained activation of downstream signaling pathways, enabling epithelial cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation; this disturbs normal physiological processes and causes tumor formation. Overexpression of HER2 is related to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. HER2 has become a well-established immunotherapy target for breast cancer. We chose to construct a second-generation CAR targeting HER 2 to test whether it kills breast cancer.MethodsWe constructed a second-generation CAR molecule targeting HER2, and we generated cells expressing this second-generation CAR through lentivirus infection of T lymphocytes. LDH assay and flow cytometry were perform to detect the effect of cells and animal models. ResultsThe result indicated that the CARHER2 T cells could selectively kill cells with high Her2 expression. The PBMC-activated/CARHer2 cells had stronger in vivo tumor suppressive activity than PBMC-activated cells, and administration of PBMC-activated/CARHer2 cells significantly improved the survival of tumor-bearing mice, and induced the production of more Th1 cytokines in tumor-bearing NSG mice.ConclusionsWe prove that the generated T cells carrying the second-generation CARHer2 molecule could effectively guide immune effector cells to identify and kill HER2-positive tumor cells and inhibit tumors in model mice.","Background:Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare and biologically aggressive. We sought to assess diagnostic and management strategies among the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) membership.Methods:An anonymous survey was distributed to ASBrS members from March-May 2023. The survey included questions about respondents’ demographics and information related to stage III and IV IBC management. Agreement was defined as a shared response by >80% of respondents. In areas of disagreement, responses were stratified by years in practice, fellowship training, and annual IBC patient volume.Results:The survey was administered to 2337 members with 399 (17.1%) completing all questions and defining the study cohort. Distribution of years in practice was 26.0% 0–10 years, 26.6% 11–20 years, and 47.4% >20 years. 51.2% reported surgical oncology or breast fellowship training, 69.2% maintain a breast-only practice, and 73.5% treat <5 IBC cases/year. Agreement was identified in diagnostic imaging, trimodal therapy, and mastectomy with wide skin excision for stage III IBC. Lack of agreement was identified in surgical management of the axilla; respondents with <10 years in practice or fellowship training were more likely to perform axillary dissection for cN0-N2 stage III IBC. Locoregional management of stage IV IBC was variable.Conclusions:Among ASBrS members, there is consensus in diagnostic evaluation, treatment sequencing, and surgical approach to the breast in stage III IBC. Differences exist in surgical management of the cN0–2 axilla with uptake of de-escalation strategies. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate oncologic safety of de-escalation in this high-risk population.",0
"PurposeDissociated response (DR, reduction at baseline or increase < 20% in target lesions compared with nadir in the presence of new lesions) was observed in 20–34% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). DRs were defined as progression disease (PD) per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1), while evaluation criteria related to immunotherapy incorporated the new lesions into the total tumor burden or conducted further evaluation after 4–8 weeks rather than declaring PD immediately. The main objective of this study is to compare survival between people who continuing initial ICIs treatment and those who switched to other anticancer therapy at the time of DR.Patients and methods235 patients with advanced lung cancer (LC) treated with ICIs were evaluated. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize potential confounding factors. Post-DR OS, target lesion changes were evaluated.Results52 patients had been estimated as DRs. After PSM, the continuing ICIs treatment Post-DR cohort still had a significantly longer median post-DR OS than discontinuing ICIs treatment Post-DR cohort, 10.63 months (95% CI 6.27–NA) versus 4.33 months (95% CI 1.77–NA), respectively (p = 0.016).ConclusionWithin the limitations of this single-center retrospective analysis, clinically stable patients who were judged by clinicians to be eligible for continuing ICIs treatment post-DR derived apparent OS benefit than discontinuing counterpart.","PurposeThere is not much progress in the treatment for lung squamous cell carcinoma LSCC in the past few years.

The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of rapamycin’s antitumor efficacy in relation to GPC3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy in LSCC.MethodsSK-MES-1 cells, a LSCC cell line, were treated with various concentrations of rapamycin with or without Glypican-3 GPC3-targeting siRNA. SK-MES-1 cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Protein expression levels of GPC3, β-catenin, Beclin-1 were checked via western blotting. We established the xenograft mice model to investigate the suppression effect of rapamycin on LSCC. In addition, we further testified the metabolism protein of autophagy process using the xenograft tumor tissue. ResultsRapamycin could inhibit the SK-MES-1 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the GPC3 expression and downregulating the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we found that GPC3 silencing can activate the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy, which contribute to the suppression of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionRapamycin suppresses the growth of lung cancer through down-regulating glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which mediates with activation of autophagy. This study suggests GPC3 is a new promising target for rapamycin in the treatment of lung cancer.",1
"Background and purpose:Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating stroke, in which acidosis is one of detrimental complications. The extracellular pH reduction can activate G protein-coupled receptor 4 (GPR4) in the brain. Yet, the extent to which proton-activated GPR4 contributes to the early brain injury (EBI) post-SAH remains largely unexplored. Ferroptosis, iron-dependent programmed cell death, has recently been shown to contribute to EBI. We aimed to investigate the effects of GPR4 inhibition on neurological deficits and neuronal ferroptosis after SAH in rats.Methods:A total 253 Sprague Dawley (SD) male rats (weighing 275–330g) were utilized in this study. SAH was induced by endovascular perforation. NE-52-QQ57 (NE), a selective antagonist of GPR4 was administered intraperitoneally 1-h post-SAH. To explore the mechanisms, RhoA activator U-46619 and YAP activator PY-60 were delivered intracerebroventricularly. Short- and long-term neurobehavior, SAH grading, Western blot assay, ELISA assay, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy was performed post-SAH.Results:Following SAH, there was an upregulation of GPR4 expression in neurons. GPR4 inhibition by NE improved both short-term and long-term neurological outcomes post-SAH. NE also reduced neuronal ferroptosis, as evidenced by decreased lipid peroxidation products 4HNE and MDA levels in brain tissues, and reduced mitochondrial shrinkage, increased mitochondria crista and decreased membrane density. The application of either U-46619 or PY-60 partially offset the neuroprotective effects of NE on neuronal ferroptosis in SAH rats.Conclusions:This study demonstrated that acid-sensing receptor GPR4 contributed to neuronal ferroptosis after SAH via RhoA/YAP pathway, and NE may be a potential therapeutic strategy to attenuate GPR4 mediated neuronal ferroptosis and EBI after SAH.","A rational design of drug nanocarriers supported by in silico modelling tools can improve the efficacy of nanosystem-based intravascular drug delivery (IVDD). Computational model development stems from the vision of replacing conventional (pre)clinical trials with advanced simulations and applies to the development of more efficient nanocarriers for intravascular therapies. To establish a standardized framework for in silico preclinical trials, it is necessary to include in silico tools that can model each experimental stage of a preclinical trial for a respective nanocarrier system and give accurate and verifiable results. This review paper highlights the status of intravascular drug delivery supported by nanocarriers and discusses the modelling stages of a physics-based multiscale modelling framework that should be developed, validated and exploited to address the need for an effective preclinical assessment of nanocarriers for IVDD.",0
"The development of single-cell and spatial technologies has enabled a more detailed understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its role in therapy response and clinical outcome of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that HGSCs with different genetic drivers harbor distinct tumor-immune microenvironments. Further, spatial cell–cell interactions have been shown to shape the CD8+ T-cell phenotypes and responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. The heterogeneous stroma consisting of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subtypes, endothelia, and site-specific stromal types such as mesothelium modulates treatment responses via increasing stiffness and by producing ligands that promote drug resistance, angiogenesis, or immune escape. Chemotherapy itself shifts CAFs toward an inflammatory phenotype that associates with poor survival and immune-suppressive signaling. New emerging immunotherapies include combinational approaches and agents targeting, for example, the tumor-intrinsic endoplasmic reticulum pathway. A more detailed understanding of the spatial interplay of tumor, immune, and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment is needed to develop more efficient immunotherapeutic strategies for HGSC.","ABSTRACTProtein-protein interactions (PPIs) play pivotal roles in biological processes and are closely linked with human diseases. Research on small molecule inhibitors targeting PPIs provides valuable insights and guidance for novel drug development. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a crucial role in regulating human innate immunity and is implicated in various pathological conditions. Therefore, modulators of the cGAS-STING pathway have garnered extensive attention. Given that this pathway involves multiple PPIs, modulating PPIs associated with the cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as a promising strategy for modulating this pathway. In this review, we summarize an overview of recent advancements in medicinal chemistry insights into cGAS-STING PPI-based modulators and propose alternative strategies for further drug discovery based on the cGAS-STING pathway.",0
"BackgroundThe incidence of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), one of the most aggressive and lethal skin tumors, is increasing worldwide. However, for advanced SKCM, we still lack an accurate and valid way to predict its prognosis, as well as novel theories to guide the planning of treatment options for SKCM patients. Lactylation (LAC), a novel post-translational modification of histones, has been shown to promote tumor growth and inhibit the antitumor response of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a variety of ways. We hope that this study will provide new ideas for treatment options for SKCM patients, as well as research on the molecular mechanisms of SKCM pathogenesis and development.MethodsAt the level of the RNA sequencing set (TCGA, GTEx), we used differential expression analysis, LASSO regression analysis, and multifactor Cox regression analysis to screen for prognosis-related genes and calculate the corresponding LAC scores. The content of TME cells in the tumor tissue was calculated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and the TME score was calculated based on its results. Finally, the LAC–TME classifier was established and further analyzed based on the two scores, including the construction of a prognostic model, analysis of clinicopathological characteristics, and correlation analysis of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immunotherapy. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, this study analyzed the cellular composition in SKCM tissues and explored the role of LAC scores in intercellular communication. To validate the functionality of the pivotal gene CLPB in the model, cellular experiments were ultimately executed.ResultsWe screened a total of six prognosis-related genes (NDUFA10, NDUFA13, CLPB, RRM2B, HPDL, NARS2) and 7 TME cells with good prognosis. According to Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, we found that the LAClow/TMEhigh group had the highest overall survival (OS) and the LAChigh/TMElow group had the lowest OS (p value < 0.05). In further analysis of immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME), functional enrichment, tumor mutational load and immunotherapy, we found that immunotherapy was more appropriate in the LAClow/TMEhigh group. Moreover, the cellular assays exhibited substantial reductions in proliferation, migration, and invasive potentials of melanoma cells in both A375 and A2058 cell lines upon CLPB knockdown.ConclusionsThe prognostic model using the combined LAC score and TME score was able to predict the prognosis of SKCM patients more consistently, and the LAC–TME classifier was able to significantly differentiate the prognosis of SKCM patients across multiple clinicopathological features. The LAC–TME classifier has an important role in the development of immunotherapy regimens for SKCM patients.","Background and aimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The mechanisms driving the transition from hepatitis to cirrhosis, and eventually, to HCC are unclear. This study aimed to clarify the metabolic changes that underly the progression of HCC and identify potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers.MethodsThis prospective study collected serum samples from patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC, hospitalized at the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, from December 2022 to December 2023. The samples were analyzed using non-targeted, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis modeling and t-tests were used to identify key differentially expressed metabolites associated with the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the key metabolic pathways involved, while machine learning models were applied to identify the metabolite signatures.ResultsWe identified 153 differentially expressed metabolites in the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC, many of which were involved in ammonia cycling or the metabolism of methylhistidine, alanine, arginine, proline, or betaine. We also identified L-histidine and adenosine as the metabolites that demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing among the hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC stages.ConclusionsOur study comprehensively characterized the metabolic profiles of the different stages of the hepatitis-cirrhosis-HCC transition. We showed that serum metabolite detection is a viable diagnostic tool for identifying and monitoring high-risk individuals, which could potentially be used to halt the development of HCC.",0
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is incurable and prone to widespread metastasis. Therefore, identification of key targets for TNBC progression is urgently needed. Our previous study revealed that isotoosendanin (ITSN) reduced TNBC metastasis by targeting TGFβR1. ITSN is currently used as an effective chemical probe to further discover the key molecules involved in TNBC metastasis downstream of TGFβR1. The results showed that GOT2 was the gene downstream of Smad2/3 and that ITSN decreased GOT2 expression by abrogating the activation of the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling pathway through directly binding to TGFβR1. GOT2 was highly expressed in TNBC, and its knockdown decreased TNBC metastasis. However, GOT2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of ITSN on TNBC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. GOT2 interacted with MYH9 and hindered its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1, thereby reducing MYH9 ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, GOT2 also enhanced the translocation of MYH9 to mitochondria and thus induced DRP1 phosphorylation, thereby promoting mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells. ITSN-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation was associated with reduced GOT2 expression. In conclusion, ITSN prevented MYH9-regulated mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells by enhancing MYH9 protein degradation through a reduction in GOT2 expression, thus contributing to its inhibition of TNBC metastasis.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a significant challenge in clinical oncology due to its aggressive nature and limited targeted therapeutic options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has emerged as a promising strategy in the management of early-stage TNBC. This literature review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the role of NACT in TNBC, focusing on its impact on early-stage disease and associated outcomes. The review synthesizes evidence from recent studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses to present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of NACT in early-stage TNBC.",1
"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment that kills cancer cells selectively by stimulating reactive oxygen species generation with photosensitizers exposed to specific light wavelengths. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a widely used photosensitizer. However, its limited tumour penetration and targeting reduce its therapeutic efficacy. Scholars have investigated nano-delivery techniques to improve 5-ALA administration and efficacy in PDT. This review summarises recent advances in biological host biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms for 5-ALA production. The review also highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of various 5-ALA nano-delivery modalities, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and gels, in treating various cancers. Although promising, 5-ALA nano-delivery methods face challenges that could impair targeting and efficacy. To determine their safety and biocompatibility, extensive preclinical and clinical studies are required. This study highlights the potential of 5-ALA-NDSs to improve PDT for cancer treatment, as well as the need for additional research to overcome barriers and improve medical outcomes.Graphical abstract","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification. M6A RNA methylation is reversible: m6A is installed by “writers”, removed by “erasers”, and recognized by “readers”. Readers are executors to regulate RNA metabolism by recognizing specific m6A sites, including RNA splicing, export, translation and decay. YTHDF2 is the first identified m6A reader protein. YTHDF2 interacts with m6A-containing transcripts to accelerate the degradation process and regulate various biological processes, such as viral infection, stem cell development and cancer progression. Although there are some reviews about m6A modification in physiological and pathological processes, few reviews focus on roles of YTHDF2 in cancers to date. Therefore, in this review, we attempted to systematically summarize m6A reader protein YTHDF2: its structure, mechanisms in regulating RNA metabolism, roles in cancer progression and potential application for cancer treatment, which might inspire new ideas for m6A research in cancers and provide novel insights into cancer treatment.",1
"BackgroundThe High Mobility Group Nucleosomal Binding Domain 1 Gene (HMGN1) is crucial for epigenetic regulation. However, the specific function of HMGN1 in cancer development is unclear.MethodsRaw data on HMGN1 expression were procured from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), the University of Alabama- Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thereafter, the pan-cancer analysis was implemented to understand the HMGN1 expression patterns, prognostic value, and immunological features. Furthermore, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was executed via R language. In addition, the relationship between HMGN1 and the sensitivity of antitumor drugs was also determined. Finally, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were carried out.ResultsPan-cancer analysis revealed that HMGN1 was upregulated in several solid tumors and was associated with pathological staging and poor prognosis. In addition, HMGN1 was found to be involved in regulating the tumor microenvironment. The GSEA enrichment analysis indicated that HMGN1 assisted in the regulation of oncogenic processes, especially metabolic and immune pathways. Furthermore, HMGN1 expression was linked to microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) across diverse tumor types. RT-PCR assays indicated that HMGN1 was overexpressed in the gastric and breast cancer cell lines and tissues.ConclusionThis study highlighted the potential of HMGN1 as a biomarker for pan-cancer analysis.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) tumors have a highly immunosuppressive desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME) where immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy has been exceptionally ineffective. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor activation leads to cancer and immune cell proliferation and phenotype, and cytokine production leading to tumor progression and worse overall survival in PDA patients. We hypothesized that TGF-β receptor inhibition may alter PDA progression and antitumor immunity in the TME. Here, we used a syngeneic preclinical murine model of PDA to explore the impact of TGF-β pathway inhibitor galunisertib (GAL), dual checkpoint immunotherapy (anti-PD-L1 and CTLA-4), the chemotherapy gemcitabine (GEM), and their combinations on antitumor immune responses. Blockade of TGF-β and ICI in immune-competent mice bearing orthotopically injected murine PDA cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and was accompanied by antitumor M1 macrophage infiltration. In contrast, GEM treatment resulted in increased PDA tumor growth, decreased antitumor M1 macrophages, and decreased cytotoxic CD8+ T cell subpopulation compared to control mice. Together, these findings demonstrate the ability of TGF-β inhibition with GAL to prime antitumor immunity in the TME and the curative potential of combining GAL with dual ICI. These preclinical results indicate that targeted inhibition of TGF-β may enhance the efficacy of dual immunotherapy in PDA. Optimal manipulation of the immune TME with non-ICI therapy may enhance therapeutic efficacy.",1
"ObjectiveGanoderic acid A can inhibit the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells. Surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of ganoderic acid A still remain poorly defined. Ganoderic acid A derivative (GaAD19) is an effective ingredient obtained by structural modification of ganoderic acid A. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-proliferation effect of GaAD19 on cervical cancer cells.MethodsThrough the HeLa cervical cancer cell model, the drug target of GaAD19 was predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database and molecular docking. Subsequently, computer analysis results were verified by a series of molecular biology experiments, such as flow cytometry, Western blot, immunocytochemical staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and so on. Then, pathway agonists and inhibitors were used to investigate the mechanism of GaAD19. Finally, the mouse model of cervical cancer was established to evaluate the inhibitory effect of GaAD19 on tumor growth in U14 cervical cancer mice.ResultsGaAD19 induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of tumors. It also blocked the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. However, in the presence of a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)agonist, the effects of GaAD19 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle transition of cancer cells were suppressed.ConclusionThis study showed that GaAD19 can play an anti-cervical cancer role by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway. These results will be helpful in further exploring the mechanism of GaAD19 in the treatment of cervical cancer.","Cancer immunotherapy has made great progress in effectively attacking or eliminating cancer. However, the challenges posed by the low reactivity of some solid tumors still remain. Macrophages, as a key component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), play an important role in determining the progression of solid tumors due to their plasticity and heterogeneity. Targeting and reprogramming macrophages in TME to desired phenotypes offers an innovative and promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. Meanwhile, the rapid development of in vivo molecular imaging techniques provides us with powerful tools to study macrophages. In this review, we summarize the current progress in macrophage reprogramming from conceptual roadmaps to therapeutic approaches, including monoclonal antibody drugs, small molecule drugs, gene therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor-engineered macrophages (CAR-M). More importantly, we highlight the significance of molecular imaging in observing and understanding the process of macrophage reprogramming during cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we introduce the therapeutic applications of imaging and reprogramming macrophages in three solid tumors. In the future, the integration of molecular imaging into the development of novel macrophage reprogramming strategies holds great promise for precise clinical cancer immunotherapy.",0
"ABSTRACT“Inadequate understanding of chirality has potentially disastrous consequences. “Genius on the left, madman on the right” is not an exaggerated verse in the field of chiral research, but a realistic warning…”","Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) (∼50–150 nm) that have emerged as promising vehicles for therapeutic applications and drug delivery. These membrane-bound particles, released by all actively dividing cells, have the ability to transfer effector molecules, including proteins, RNA, and even DNA, from donor cells to recipient cells, thereby modulating cellular responses. RNA-based therapeutics, including microRNAs, messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, hold great potential in controlling gene expression and treating a spectrum of medical conditions. RNAs encapsulated in EVs are protected from extracellular degradation, making them attractive for therapeutic applications. Understanding the intricate biology of cargo loading and transfer within EVs is pivotal to unlocking their therapeutic potential. This review discusses the biogenesis and classification of EVs, methods for loading RNA into EVs, their advantages as drug carriers over synthetic-lipid-based systems, and the potential applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Notably, EVs show promise in delivering RNA cargo across the blood-brain barrier and targeting tumor cells, offering a safe and effective approach to RNA-based therapy in these contexts.",1
"AbstractProtein kinases play a key role in cellular signaling pathways including proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and immune regulation. Therefore, targeting kinases with small molecules has emerged as a therapeutic potential in cancers and other diseases including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The main chemical motifs of the available small molecule kinase inhibitors are heterocyclic, nitrogen-containing and six-membered rings including pyrazine. Several potent and selective pyrazine-based kinase inhibitors have been developed and progressed into clinical trials. The data of clinical application of kinase inhibitors demonstrate good clinical activity with manageable toxicity in several relapse-resistant malignancies and severe to moderate immunological disorders. All pyrazine-based kinase inhibitors are orally active. This paper reviews the most recent kinase literature (2019–2023) related to pyrazine-based small molecule inhibitors. This review includes the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved and patent agents along with their targeted kinase, scaffold, potency, selectivity profile, assignee and biological results in clinical and preclinical studies.","Aim: Arsenic has excellent anti-advanced liver cancer effects through a variety of pathways, but its severe systemic toxicity forces the need for a safe and effective delivery strategy.Methods: Based on the chelating metal ion properties of polydopamine (PDA), arsenic was immobilized on an organic carrier, and a M1-like macrophage cell membrane (MM)-camouflaged manganese-arsenic complex mesoporous polydopamine  nanoplatform was successfully constructed.  was evaluated at the cellular level for tumor inhibition and tumor localization, and in vivo for its anti-liver cancer effect in a Hepa1-6 tumor-bearing mouse model.Results: The nanoplatform targeted the tumor site through the natural homing property of MM, completely degraded and released drugs to kill tumor cells in an acidic environment, while playing an immunomodulatory role in promoting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) repolarization.Conclusion:  has synergistically enhanced the targeted therapeutics against liver cancer via nanotechnology and immunotherapy, and it is expected to become a safe and multifunctional treatment platform in clinical oncology.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDB-raf proto-oncogene (BRAF)-mutant melanoma brain metastases (BRAF MBM) are associated with poor prognosis. Amidst our large institutional experience treating patients with BRAF MBM with multimodality therapy, our aim was to identify disease and treatment-related prognostic features, accounting for longitudinal sequence of events, to inform clinical decision-making. METHODSWe retrospectively reviewed electronic health records of 100 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosed with BRAF MBM. Demographic, disease, and clinical factors including treatment sequencing were tabulated. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the study population and non-parametric tests were used to evaluate differences across groups. A multivariable Cox regression identified factors associated with overall survival (OS) following BRAF MBM diagnosis. RESULTSMedian follow-up was 22 months and median OS was 33.5 months. Patients received an average [standard deviation (SD)] of 3.36 [1.06] unique therapies. After adjustment for covariates, greater number of brain metastases at initial diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.3 [1.14-4.62], p=0.01 for 3-10 metastases and HR 2.54 [1.01-6.36], p=0.04 for >10 metastases, respectively), receipt of combination IO and targeted therapy prior to BRAF MBM diagnosis (HR 2.91 [1.08-7.86], p=0.03), and receipt of no unique subsequent therapy after initial management strategy (HR 3.89 [1.48-10.16], p=0.005) were significantly associated with worse OS. CONCLUSIONSDespite heterogeneity in individual treatment sequences, patients with greater intracranial disease burden and those receiving combination targeted and immunotherapy prior to BRAF MBM diagnoses had the worst outcomes. Dynamic changes in therapy resistance may inform optimal treatment strategies for individuals with BRAF MBM.","We present a case of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with metastasis to the right ventricle (RV) successfully treated through surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). A 50-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, prompting transthoracic echocardiography that revealed a mobile, irregular RV mass measuring 40 × 32 mm. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed masses in the RV and the right pulmonary artery, which was totally occluded. Emergency surgical resection of both masses was performed to avoid sudden death. Histopathological analysis confirmed squamous cell carcinoma; however, the primary origin of the masses remained unidentified despite extensive evaluations, including positron emission tomography-CT. The final diagnosis was SCCUP. Immunohistochemistry indicated positive programmed cell death ligand 1, and postoperative chemotherapy with an ICI was administered. One year post-surgery, the patient remains healthy with no sign of recurrence.Learning objectiveThis case shows the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with cardiac metastasis through emergency surgery and postoperative immunotherapy. Despite the poor prognosis associated with cardiac metastatic malignant tumors and the lack of established treatment guidelines, this case highlights the potential benefits of surgical intervention and the efficacy of immunotherapy in managing cardiac metastatic SCCUP, with the patient remaining with no recurrence one-year post-surgery.",0
"AbstractMiniproteins constitute an excellent basis for the development of structurally demanding functional molecules. The engrailed homeodomain, a three‐helix‐containing miniprotein, was applied as a scaffold for constructing programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) interaction inhibitors. PD‐L1 binders were initially designed using the computer‐aided approach and subsequently optimized iteratively. The conformational stability was assessed for each obtained miniprotein using circular dichroism spectroscopy, indicating that numerous mutations could be introduced. The formation of a sizable hydrophobic surface at the inhibitor that fits the molecular target imposed the necessity for the incorporation of additional charged amino acid residues to retain its appropriate solubility. Finally, the miniprotein effectively binding to PD‐L1 (K D = 51.4 nM) that inhibits PD‐1/PD‐L1 interaction in cell‐based studies with EC50 = 3.9 μM, was discovered.","AbstractBACKGROUNDImmunotherapy is an effective personalized treatment for several cancers. Radiogenomics in glioblastoma patients may serve as pre-operative biomarkers of the tumor-host immune apparatus. Validated biomarkers would have the potential to stratify patients during immunotherapy clinical trials, and if trials are beneficial, facilitate personalized neo-adjuvant treatment. The aim of the study is to identify machine learning based radiological biomarkers that can predict immune status within the tumor microenvironment of IDH wildtype glioblastoma. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis is a retrospective multicentre machine learning based study utilizing open access anonymized matched radiogenomic data of TCGA-GBM, CPTAC, Ivy GAP and REMBRANDT datasets. REMBRANDT data acted as a hold out dataset for validation. Imaging data consisted of pre-operative MRI based radiomics features extracted from deep learning based segmented tumours. Transcriptomic data-based overall immune scores and cell-specific (T cells and tumour associated macrophages-TAMS) scores were extracted using CIBERSORTx. Outliers were identified and filtered using principal component analysis. Combat and neuroCombat were utilized for data harmonization of genomic and imaging data respectively. Radiomic feature selection was performed using LASSO technique with cross validation. Support vector machine (SVM) was trained and tested with 80:20 radiomic data split, and binary labels based on  overall immune scores, and  immune cell-specific scores. Data query and analysis was performed using python. RESULTSOne hundred and one patients with 15 in the hold out dataset were included in the study. Trained SVM models predicted the labels for immune score and cell-specific scores (T cells -CD4, CD8; TAMS - M0, M1, M2) with AUC of 0.93, 0.79, 0.86, 0.81, 0.95, 0.76; balanced accuracy of 0.72, 0.82, 0.93, 0.80, 0.86, 0.71 respectively. In the holdout set, the models predicted the labels with robust prediction sensitivity for overall immune scores (100%) and M2 (M2 pro-tumour subtype macrophages) scores (75%) and with robust prediction specificity for T cell scores (CD4: 100%, CD8: 90%) along with M0 (M0 precursor pro-tumour macrophages) (62.5%) and M1 (M1 anti-tumour subtype macrophages) (83%) scores. The radiomic signature employed for prediction models were a group of first order and second order radiomic features obtained after feature selection. CONCLUSIONA radiogenomic SVM model non-invasively predicted immune status in wildtype glioblastoma microenvironment with good accuracy. This model has the potential to be utilized in a prospective glioblastoma clinical trial for immunotherapy.",0
"PurposeThe aim of this study was to analyse the correlation of extracranial metastasis sites (ECMs) to the incidence risk of brain metastasis (BMs) in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods18349 newly diagnosed patients were retrospectively analysed, and 4919 pairs of cases were matched by propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio. Alternative factors were analysed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. And the interaction analysis and subgroup analysis were carried out. ResultsThe incidences of Brain, Lung, Liver, Bone, Multiple and Other metastasis were 26.9%, 20.2%, 4.6%, 19.9%, 16.9% and 38.3%, respectively. Results suggested that Age, Race, Histological type, Grade, T stage, N stage and Organ metastasis site were risk factors (p < 0.05). The interaction analysis suggested interaction effects between the Primary site, T stage, N stage and Organ metastasis site. The subgroup analysis showed that the Organ metastasis site and the risk of BMs were statistically significant except that the Overlapping subgroup (p = 0.267) of the Primary site. And the incidence risk of BMs in Lung metastasis, Liver metastasis and Bone metastasis groups was lower than that in other metastasis group (OR 1, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the Multiple metastasis group and the other metastasis group (OR 1.091, p = 0.169).ConclusionAdvanced age, non-Asian/Pacific Islander, non-squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated grade, and higher T/N stage were risk factors for increased BMs in stage IV NSCLC, and the ECMs were associated with the risk of BMs.","Since the publication of the first issue of Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, we have witnessed advances in multiple research areas that have culminated in improved outcomes for many cancer types, although substantial unmet needs remain for a majority of patients worldwide. Here, we have asked experts in several key specialities to reflect on the progress from the past 20 years and propose the next steps to enable further advances.

"Increasing evidence indicates that Calumenin (CALU), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is significantly associated with tumor progression. However, the effect of CALU on patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unknown. By integrating multi-omics data and molecular biology experiments, we found that CALU expression was significantly increased in tumors compared with normal tissues, and the pathological grade and prognosis of patients were correlated with CALU expression. Next, knockdown or ectopic expression of CALU could affect the proliferative and invasive abilities of ccRCC cells. Moreover, immune landscape characterization revealed that CALU expression was positively associated with neutrophils and macrophages, whereas it was negatively associated with natural killer T cells and CD8+ T cells. Single-cell sequencing showed that the localization and binding targets of CALU mainly involved monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Sensitivity analysis of common chemotherapeutic drugs showed that high expression of CALU could sensitize chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol, AMG-706 and Cytarabine, but could lead to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as Embelin, Salubrinal and Tipifarnib. We demonstrated a significant correlation between high CALU expression and poor patient survival. Further, we demonstrated a correlation between CALU expression, tumor microenvironment, and the sensitivity of patients to common chemo- and immuno-therapy drugs. Thus, our results indicate that CALU could be a biomarker and designing personalized treatment approaches for ccRCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00169-7.","Tumor organoids are biological models for studying precision medicine. Microfluidic technology offers significant benefits for high throughput drug screening using tumor organoids. However, the range of concentrations achievable with traditional linear gradient generators in microfluidics is restricted, generating logarithmic drug concentration gradients by adjusting the channel ratio in the chip is confined to single-drug dilution chips, significantly restricting the application of microfluidics in drug screening. Here, we presented a microfluidic chip featuring continuous dilution capabilities, which generates logarithmic stepwise drug concentration gradients. We have devised a “mathematical-circuit-chip” model for designing such chips, and based on this model, we have developed and fabricated a device capable of providing 36 distinct drug concentration conditions for two types of drugs. The chip is composed of two structurally identical yet orthogonally arranged layers, each containing a dilution network capable of forming a 5-fold gradient and a tumor organoid culture module. Drug and culture medium delivery to the open culture chamber array is driven by syringe pumps. We have conducted drug screening experiments on patient-derived tumor organoids. This device facilitates high-throughput drug screening for patient-derived organoids, representing a significant stride toward the realization of precision medicine.",0
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The introduction of biologics, particularly anti-interleukin (IL) agents, has revolutionized IBD treatment. This review summarizes the role of ILs in IBD pathophysiology and describes the efficacy and positioning of anti-IL therapies. We discuss the functions of key ILs in IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets. The review then discusses anti-IL therapies, focusing primarily on ustekinumab (anti-IL-12/23), risankizumab (anti-IL-23), and mirikizumab (anti-IL-23). Clinical trial data demonstrate their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The safety profiles of these agents are generally favorable. However, long-term safety data for newer agents are still limited. The review also briefly discusses emerging therapies such as guselkumab and brazikumab. Network meta-analyses suggest that anti-IL therapies perform well compared to other biological agents. These agents may be considered first- or second-line therapies for many patients, especially those with comorbidities or safety concerns. Anti-IL therapies represent a significant advancement in IBD treatment, offering effective and relatively safe options for patients with moderate to severe disease.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a common global health problem as prevalence continues to rise. It is often associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Limitations in current IBD biomarker-based diagnosis hinder the accuracy of early detection of CRC progression. Therefore, in this study, we proposed the use of transcription factor (TF)-based biomarkers that can potentially detect the transition of IBD to CRC. Various bioinformatic analysis and online database validations, and RT-qPCR validations were performed to identify possible diagnostic TFs. RUNX1 was identified as a promising TF that regulates 106 IBD/CRC-related genes. The incorporation of RUNX1 in combination with currently known IBD biomarkers, FEV + NFKB1 + RELA, achieved a comparable sensitivity and specificity scores of 99% and 87%, respectively, while RUNX1 in combination with known CRC markers, CEA + TIMP1 + CA724 + CA199, achieved a sensitivity and specificity score of 97% and 99%, respectively. Furthermore, a small pilot RT-qPCR-based analysis confirmed a demarcated shift in expression profiles in CA724, CEA, RUNX1 and TIMP1 in IBD patients compared to CRC patients’ tissue samples. Specifically, CA724 is noticeably elevated in IBD, while the levels of CEA, RUNX1 with TIMP1 are probable genes that may be employed in discerning IBD progression to CRC. Therefore, these preliminary results once validated in large patient cohorts could potentially have a significant impact on CRC disease stratification, resulting in a more precise prediction for treatment and treatment outcomes, especially in South African patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10528-024-10917-z.",1
"AbstractDrug resistance remains a major obstacle in cancer treatment, leading to treatment failures and high mortality rates. Despite advancements in therapies, overcoming resistance requires a deeper understanding of its mechanisms. This review highlights CDK2's pivotal role in both intrinsic and acquired resistance, and its potential as a therapeutic target. Cyclin E upregulation, which partners with CDK2, is linked to poor prognosis and resistance across various cancers. Specifically, amplifications of CCNE1/CCNE2 are associated with resistance to targeted therapies, immunotherapy, endocrine therapies and chemo/radiotherapy. Given CDK2's involvement in resistance mechanisms, investigating its role presents promising opportunities for developing novel strategies to combat resistance and improve treatment outcomes.","Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is an antibody-drug conjugate approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Several clinicals trials are investigating InO in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy or other anti-ALL targeted therapies in the salvage and frontline settings, notably in older adults who often cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy and tend to have higher-risk disease. InO is also increasingly used to bridge patients to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), in sequence with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, to eliminate measurable residual disease, and to prevent post-HSCT relapse. Veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) is a potential complication of InO treatment, particularly when followed by HSCT. Herein, we review the historical development and current status of InO, strategies for mitigating InO-related VOD/SOS risk, and future directions for InO research and clinical use.",1
"PurposeBaseline tumor size (BTS) and the presence of massive lesions are important for predicting the clinical course of cancer. However, their impact on survival and clinical response in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment has been scarcely investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 294 patients who underwent ICI therapy for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between January 2016 and July 2019.ResultsOf these 294 patients, 284 (96.6%) had at least one measurable lesion. Of these, 263 patients treated with ICI monotherapy were included in the analysis. The median total and maximum target lesion diameters were 96.5 mm and 49.1 mm, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) with massive lesions (max BTS > 50 mm, group A) and without massive lesions (max BTS ≤ 50 mm, group B) was 2.5 months (95% CI 1.8–3.7) and 6.7 months (95% CI 5.1–9.7), respectively. Median overall survival (OS) for groups A and B was 9.5 months (95% CI 5.5–12.3) and 20.0 months (95% CI 13.3–32.0), respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between the presence of massive lesions and both PFS and OS.ConclusionThe presence of massive lesions (max diameters > 50 mm) is an independent prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC treated with ICI monotherapy. Although overall response rates were similar between groups A and B, the disease control rate was significantly poorer for group A. Max BTS might be useful for predicting clinical outcomes for patients undergoing immunotherapy as a parameter reflecting their tumor burden.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03271-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"To evaluate the prognostic significance and molecular mechanism of NETosis markers in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OSC), we constructed a machine learning-based pathomic model utilizing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. We analyzed 333 patients with OSC from The Cancer Genome Atlas for prognostic-related neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) genes through bioinformatics analysis. Pathomic features were extracted from 54 cases with complete pathological images, genetic matrices, and clinical information. Two pathomic prognostic models were constructed using support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) algorithms. Additionally, we established a predictive scoring system that integrated pathomic scores based on the NETcluster subtypes and clinical signature. We identified four NETosis genes significantly correlated with OSC prognosis, which were functionally associated with immune response, somatic mutations, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Five robust pathomic features were selected for overall survival prediction. The LR and SVM pathomic models demonstrated strong predictive performance for the NETcluster subtype classification through five-fold cross-validation. Time-dependent ROC analysis revealed excellent prognostic capability of the LR pathomic model’s score for the overall survival (AUC values of 0.658, 0.761, and 0.735 at 36, 48, and 60 months, respectively), further validated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. The expression levels of NETosis genes greatly affected OSC patients’ prognoses. The pathomic analysis of H&E slide pathological images provides an effective approach for predicting both NETcluster subtype and overall survival in OSC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10278-024-01366-6.","BackgroundTyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-PD-1 antibodies in combination provide survival benefits for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). However, the tool used to determine which patients likely benefit most from this treatment strategy has not been reported. We sought to develop a prognostic scoring system based on tumor burden score (TBS) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to predict the long-term prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies.MethodsData on patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies from multiple centers were collected. The prognostic accuracy of TBS, AFP, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and CTA (Combined TBS and AFP) for 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated.ResultsOverall, 278 patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies were enrolled, including 48 BCLC-B and 230 BCLC-C HCC patients. CTA (AUC = 0.721 and 0.683) outperformed TBS (AUC = 0.680 and 0.621), AFP (AUC = 0.606 and 0.594), and BCLC staging (AUC = 0.551 and 0.555) in predicting PFS and OS. The 2-year PFS and OS for low CTA (low TBS/low AFP) were 65.7% and 94.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than 21.6% and 44.9% (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002), respectively, for intermediate CTA (low TBS/high AFP or high TBS/low AFP) and 8.7% and 12.1% (both p < 0.001), respectively, for high CTA (high TBS/high AFP). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that CTA grading was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS (referent: low CTA; intermediate CTA, HR 2.87 and 7.17; high CTA, HR 5.52 and 10.31, respectively).ConclusionsCTA grading is an accurate tool for stratifying the prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies and may help determine which patients may benefit more from this treatment strategy.",0
"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) (∼50–150 nm) that have emerged as promising vehicles for therapeutic applications and drug delivery. These membrane-bound particles, released by all actively dividing cells, have the ability to transfer effector molecules, including proteins, RNA, and even DNA, from donor cells to recipient cells, thereby modulating cellular responses. RNA-based therapeutics, including microRNAs, messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, hold great potential in controlling gene expression and treating a spectrum of medical conditions. RNAs encapsulated in EVs are protected from extracellular degradation, making them attractive for therapeutic applications. Understanding the intricate biology of cargo loading and transfer within EVs is pivotal to unlocking their therapeutic potential. This review discusses the biogenesis and classification of EVs, methods for loading RNA into EVs, their advantages as drug carriers over synthetic-lipid-based systems, and the potential applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Notably, EVs show promise in delivering RNA cargo across the blood-brain barrier and targeting tumor cells, offering a safe and effective approach to RNA-based therapy in these contexts.","Circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary strategy in cancer immunotherapy, facilitating novel approaches to induce robust and durable immune responses. Unlike traditional linear messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development. This review delved into the fundamental principles underlying circRNA biology, highlighting their unique structural advantages and translational potential. We examined recent advancements in circRNA vaccine design, focusing on their application in oncology. As the circRNA-based cancer vaccine is a relatively novel technology, findings from all the major studies describing its efficacy were discussed. We further investigated their combination with other immunotherapeutic modalities, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies, that ensure the maximal anticancer effects of circRNA vaccines. Large-scale manufacturing, immunogenicity optimization, delivery systems, and other challenges and future directions in this field were also discussed. This study aims to thoroughly analyze the state-of-the-art and potential future applications of circRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy, highlighting them as exciting possibilities for next-generation cancer therapies.",1
"BackgroundAs a common psychological problem in cancer patients, illness uncertainty has attracted wide attention from scholars. Some studies have pointed out that the level of social support may affect illness uncertainty in patients with cancer, but the results of these studies remain controversial.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between illness uncertainty and social support in patients with cancer using meta-analysis.MethodsPubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and VIP Citation Database were searched for articles published up to 2022. The screening of the literature, data extraction, and quality assessment of the included studies were performed independently by 2 researchers. Stata 17.0 software was used to analyze the overall and moderation effects.ResultsNotably, 41 studies involving 5403 patients were included. The results showed that the illness uncertainty of adults with cancer was moderately negatively correlated with social support (r = −0.33). Country, publication year, cancer type, and instrument used to measure social support moderated the association between illness uncertainty and social support.ConclusionImproving the level of social support can reduce illness uncertainty experienced by adults with cancer to a certain extent.Implications for PracticeThis review provides a clear direction for implementing precise interventions to reduce illness uncertainty among adults with cancer. Furthermore, patients with cancer with high morbidity and mortality rates deserve greater attention from healthcare personnel and family caregivers.","ObjectiveImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been validated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, there exists no evidence regarding NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, experiencing EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment failure. We collected clinical information from real world and conducted a time series-based meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations and experienced EGFR-TKIs resistance.MethodsTwenty-two NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations after TKI resistance were included from two hospitals. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literature published until December 31, 2021. Endpoint outcomes included mortality and progression-free survival (PFS) at different times of follow-up.ResultsIn total, 22 patients showed that the median PFS was 5.6 months (range 2.0–9.0 months). According to treatment strategies, the median PFS was 2.4 months (range 2.0–5.3 months) in the ICI monotherapy group and 5.9 months (range 2.8–9.0 months) in the ICI combined Chemotherapy group. Additionally, sixteen studies, including 5 trials, 10 controlled cohorts and 1 real-world study, were assessed, involving a total of ICI-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation after TKI failure. The 6-month survival and PFS rate were 0.82 (95% CI 0.36–0.97) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.34–0.74), respectively. ICI combined chemotherapy showed the best survival outcome among these groups, as demonstrated by the 12-month survival rate and PFS. No new safety signals were identified with the combination therapy. The frequency of treatment-related adverse events was similar to that in previously reported studies of chemotherapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors.ConclusionsThe addition of ICIs plus chemotherapy may significantly improve progression-free survival among patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who EGFR-TKIs resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04176-x.",1
"AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.","AbstractBackgroundThe comparative effects of specific blood pressure (BP) lowering treatments on patient‐important outcomes following kidney transplantation are uncertain. Our 2009 Cochrane review found that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) improved graft function and prevented graft loss, while the evidence for other BP‐lowering treatments was limited. This is an update of the 2009 Cochrane review.ObjectivesTo compare the benefits and harms of different classes and combinations of antihypertensive drugs in kidney transplant recipients.Search methodsWe contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 3 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating any BP‐lowering agent in recipients of a functioning kidney transplant for at least two weeks were eligible.Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently assessed the risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised using the random‐effects model and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) processes. The primary outcomes included all‐cause death, graft loss, and kidney function.Main resultsNinety‐seven studies (8706 participants) were included. One study evaluated treatment in children. The overall risk of bias was unclear to high across all domains.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, CCBs probably reduce all‐cause death (23 studies, 3327 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) and graft loss (24 studies, 3577 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). CCBs may make little or no difference to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (11 studies, 2250 participants: MD 1.89 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 4.48; I2 = 48%; low certainty evidence) and acute rejection (13 studies, 906 participants: RR 10.8, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). CCBs may reduce systolic BP (SBP) (3 studies, 329 participants: MD ‐5.83 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐10.24 to ‐1.42; I2 = 13%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (DBP) (3 studies, 329 participants: MD ‐3.98 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐5.98 to ‐1.99; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). CCBs have uncertain effects on proteinuria.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) may make little or no difference to all‐cause death (7 studies, 702 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.21; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), graft loss (6 studies, 718 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.13; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), eGFR (4 studies, 509 participants: MD ‐2.46 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐7.66 to 2.73; I2 = 64%; low certainty evidence) and acute rejection (4 studies, 388 participants: RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.04; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). ACEi may reduce proteinuria (5 studies, 441 participants: MD ‐0.33 g/24 hours, 95% CI ‐0.64 to ‐0.01; I2 = 67%; low certainty evidence) but had uncertain effects on SBP and DBP.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may make little or no difference to all‐cause death (6 studies, 1041 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.31; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), eGRF (5 studies, 300 participants: MD ‐1.91 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐6.20 to 2.38; I2 = 57%; low certainty evidence), and acute rejection (4 studies, 323 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.29; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). ARBs may reduce graft loss (6 studies, 892 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.84; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), SBP (10 studies, 1239 participants: MD ‐3.73 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐7.02 to ‐0.44; I2 = 63%; moderate certainty evidence) and DBP (9 studies, 1086 participants: MD ‐2.75 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐4.32 to ‐1.18; I2 = 47%; moderate certainty evidence), but has uncertain effects on proteinuria.The effects of CCBs, ACEi or ARB compared to placebo or standard care alone on cardiovascular outcomes (including fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke) or other adverse events were uncertain.The comparative effects of ACEi plus ARB dual therapy, alpha‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists compared to placebo or standard care alone were rarely evaluated.Head‐to‐head comparisons of ACEi, ARB or thiazide versus CCB, ACEi versus ARB, CCB or ACEi versus alpha‐ or beta‐blockers, or ACEi plus CCB dual therapy versus ACEi or CCB monotherapy were scarce. No studies reported outcome data for cancer or life participation.Authors' conclusionsFor kidney transplant recipients, the use of CCB therapy to reduce BP probably reduces death and graft loss compared to placebo or standard care alone, while ARB may reduce graft loss. The effects of ACEi and ARB compared to placebo or standard care on other patient‐centred outcomes were uncertain. The effects of dual therapy, alpha‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists compared to placebo or standard care alone and the comparative effects of different treatments were uncertain.",1
"ABSTRACTCancer is increasingly being recognized as a global health issue with considerable unmet medical need. Despite the rapid progression of anticancer pharmaceuticals, there are still significant challenges for the effective management of cancer. In many circumstances, cancer cells are difficult to detect and treat. Combination of nanovesicles (NVs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), referred as magnetic nanovesicles (MNVs), is now well recognized as a potential theranostic option for improving cancer treatment outcomes and reducing adverse effects. MNVs can be used for monitoring the long-term fate and functional benefits of cancer therapy. Moreover, MNV-mediated hyperthermia mechanism has been explored as a potential technique for triggering cancer cell death, and/or controlled release of laden cargo. In this review, we focus on the unique characteristics of MNVs as a promising avenue for targeted drug delivery, diagnosis, and treatments of cancer or tumor. Moreover, we discuss critical considerations related to the issues raised in this area, which will guide future research toward better anti-cancer therapeutics for clinical applications.","ABSTRACTLymphoma, a blood tumor, has become the ninth most common cancer in the world in 2020. Targeted inhibition is one of the important treatments for lymphoma. At present, there are many kinds of targeted drugs for the treatment of lymphoma. Studies have shown that Histone deacetylase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase all play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors and become important and promising inhibitory targets. This article mainly expounds the important role of these target protein in tumors, and introduces the mechanism of action, structure–activity relationship and clinical research of listed small molecule inhibitors of these targets, hoping to provide new ideas for the treatment of lymphoma.",1
"PurposeChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has demonstrated clinical success in treating haematologic malignancies but has not been effective against solid tumours thus far. Trop2 is a tumour-related antigen broadly overexpressed on a variety of tumours and has been reported as a promising target for pancreatic cancers. Our study aimed to determine whether CAR T cells designed with a fully human Trop2-specific single-chain fragment variable (scFv) can be used in the treatment of Trop2-positive pancreatic tumours.MethodsWe designed Trop2-targeted chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells with a novel human anti-Trop2 scFv (2F11) and then investigated the cytotoxicity, degranulation, and cytokine secretion profiles of the anti-Trop2 CAR T cells when they were exposed to Trop2 + cancer cells in vitro. We also studied the antitumour efficacy and toxicity of Trop2-specific CAR T cells in vivo using a BxPC-3 pancreatic xenograft model.ResultsTrop2-targeted CAR T cells designed with 2F11 effectively killed Trop2-positive pancreatic cancer cells and produced high levels of cytotoxic cytokines in vitro. In addition, Trop2-targeted CAR T cells, which persistently circulate in vivo and efficiently infiltrate into tumour tissues, significantly blocked and even eliminated BxPC-3 pancreatic xenograft tumour growth without obvious deleterious effects observed after intravenous injection into NSG mice. Moreover, disease-free survival was efficiently prolonged.ConclusionThese results show that Trop2-targeted CAR T cells equipped with a fully human anti-Trop2 scFv could be a potential treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer and could be useful for clinical evaluation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04017-x.","HPV vaccination rates remain suboptimal in the United States. While the current literature focuses on expressly hesitant parents, few studies have examined parents with “high intent”, or those indicating they definitely will vaccinate and have had the opportunity but not yet vaccinated their adolescents. Our objective was to differentiate characteristics of mothers with high intent from those who already vaccinated their adolescents using various socioeconomic, previous vaccine decision-making, and healthcare provider relationship-related variables. English-speaking mothers or female guardians of adolescents ages 11-14 years living in low HPV vaccine uptake states within the U.S. in September 2018 were recruited from a national survey panel as part of a larger study. We assessed HPV vaccine status of their adolescents and categorized respondents into two categories: Already Vaccinated and High Intent. We assessed differences using a multivariable logistic regression model. Among 2,406 mothers, 18% reported high intent vs. 82% already having vaccinated. Mothers with high intent were more likely to identify as non-Hispanic White (p=0.01), to have a younger adolescent (p<0.001), and to report not receiving a provider HPV vaccination recommendation (p<0.001). Mothers who estimated that half/more (vs. less) of their child’s friends have received/will receive the vaccine had higher odds of already vaccinating (p<0.001). Our findings suggest that clinicians may be able to improve HPV vaccination uptake within their practices by giving repeated, high-quality recommendations to parents of children who are not yet vaccinated. Additionally, these findings indicate perceived social norms may play a large role in on-time vaccine uptake. Reassuring hesitant parents that most parents accept the vaccine may also improve uptake in clinical practice.",0
"PurposeThis study aims to establish a risk prediction model based on prognosis-related genes (PRGs) and clinicopathological factors, and investigate the biological activities of PRGs in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).MethodsRisk score signatures were developed by employing multiple algorithms and their amalgamations. A predictive model for overall survival was established through the integration of risk score signatures and several clinicopathological parameters. A comprehensive single-cell atlas, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to investigate the biological activities of prognosis-related genes in LUAD.ResultsA risk prediction model was established based on 16 PRGs, exhibiting robust performance in predicting overall survival. The single-cell analysis revealed that epithelial cells were primarily associated with worse survival of LUAD, and PRGs were predominantly enriched in malignant epithelial cells and influenced epithelial cell growth and progression. Furthermore, GSEA and GSVA analysis showed that PRGs were involved in tumor pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hypoxia and KRAS_UP, and high GSVA scores are correlated with worse outcome in LUAD patients.ConclusionsThe constructed risk prediction model in this study offers clinicians a valuable tool for tailoring treatment strategies of LUAD and provides a comprehensive interpretation on the biological activities of PRGs in LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05403-9.","ABSTRACTPatients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have very poor long-term outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can potentially cure some of these patients who are able to achieve a second or greater remission with salvage chemotherapy.

Therefore, novel therapies to decrease the risk of relapse in these patients are urgently needed.

"Purpose:Myocardial infarction (MI) with subsequent inflammation is one of the most common heart conditions leading to progressive tissue damage. A reliable imaging marker to assess tissue viability after MI would help determine the risks and benefits of any intervention. In this study, we investigate whether a new mitochondria-targeted imaging agent, 18F-labeled 2’-deoxy-2’−18F-fluoro-9-β-d-arabinofuranosylguanine ([18F]F-AraG), a positron emission tomography (PET) agent developed for imaging activated T cells, is suitable for cardiac imaging and to test the myocardial viability after MI.Procedure:To test whether the myocardial [18F]-F-AraG signal is coming from cardiomyocytes or immune infiltrates, we compared cardiac signal in wild-type (WT) mice with that of T cell deficient Rag1 knockout (Rag1 KO) mice. We assessed the effect of dietary nucleotides on myocardial [18F]F-AraG uptake in normal heart by comparing [18F]F-AraG signals between mice fed with purified diet and those fed with purified diet supplemented with nucleotides. The myocardial viability was investigated in rodent model by imaging rat with [18F]F-AraG and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) before and after MI. All PET signals were quantified in terms of the percent injected dose per cc (%ID/cc). We also explored [18F]FDG signal variability and potential T cell infiltration into fibrotic area in the affected myocardium with H&E analysis.Results:The difference in %ID/cc for Rag1 KO and WT mice was not significant (p = ns) indicating that the [18F]F-AraG signal in the myocardium was primarily coming from cardiomyocytes. No difference in myocardial uptake was observed between [18F]F-AraG signals in mice fed with purified diet and with purified diet supplemented with nucleotides (p = ns). The [18F]FDG signals showed wider variability at different time points. Noticeable [18F]F-AraG signals were observed in the affected MI regions. There were T cells in the fibrotic area in the H&E analysis, but they did not constitute the predominant infiltrates.Conclusions:Our preliminary preclinical data show that [18F]F-AraG accumulates in cardiomyocytes indicating that it may be suitable for cardiac imaging and to evaluate the myocardial viability after MI.","Inflammation and a dysregulated immune system are common denominators in cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) highlighted the convergence of interleukin (IL)-1β biology in cancer and CVD, and the potential of anti–IL-1β drugs for the treatment of both disease entities. Accumulating evidence further supports the role of the innate immunity members and IL-1β activators, S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in both cancer and CVD. This review outlines the common involvement of S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in cancer and CVD. Specifically, their time-, cell-, and context-dependent actions and hereto-related dichotomous role in different cancers and CVD are addressed, highlighting the need for further insights to allow tailored therapies.",1
"BackgroundThis study aims at screening and validation of prospective genetic signature for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) prognosis and treatment.MethodsThe immune-related genes (IRGs) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset where a total of 535 LUAD and 59 control samples were included. A risk model was then developed for the risk stratification of LUAD patients. The immune cell infiltration, clinical outcomes, and the therapeutic efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) blockade were compared between high and low-risk groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to explore the biological processes and signalling pathways associated with the IRGs. Finally, IRGs mRNA levels were assayed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in LUAD and relevant cell lines.ResultsTwo IRGs, P2RX1 (purinergic receptor P2X 1) and PCP4 (Purkinje cell protein 4), were screened from a module that possesses the highest correlation with plasma cells. RT-qPCR verified the expression of the two IRGs in plasmacytoma cell RPMI 8226 but not in LUAD cells. A higher risk score is associated with a lower infiltration of immune cells. Kaplan–Meier and nomogram analysis showed that the high-risk group has a lower survival rate than the low-risk cohort. Furthermore, the high-risk group had a worse response rate to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade. GSVA and GSEA-GO results indicated that a lower risk score is linked to signalling pathways and biological functions promoting immune response and inflammation. In contrast, a higher risk score is associated with signalling cascades promoting tumour growth.ConclusionThe immune-related prognostic model based on P2RX1 and PCP4 is conducive to predicting the therapeutic response of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade and clinical outcomes of LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05153-8.",Key Points•This trial used a class I–restricted TCR and a CD8 coreceptor to enable antigen–specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell function.•Primary end points of feasibility and tolerability were met in a phase 1 clinical trial of HA-1 TCR-T for recurrent leukemia after HCT.,0
"PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant patients with CRC using a large population-based database.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2009 to 2019. Pregnant patients with and without CRC were compared for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, maternal and perinatal outcomes, and hospital burden.ResultsThe study included 306 pregnancies with CRC and 40,887,353 pregnancies without CRC. Pregnant patients with CRC were older and more likely to be White. A significant association was observed between CRC and a history of inflammatory bowel disease or a family history of gastrointestinal cancer. Pregnant patients with CRC had higher odds of maternal death (AOR 260.99, 95% CI 33.36–2041.64), cardiac arrhythmia (AOR 13.73, 95% CI 4.21–44.76), acute kidney injury (AOR 32.6, 95% CI 5.29–200.77), severe sepsis (AOR 163.98, 95% CI 22.05–1219.65), and respiratory failure (AOR 31.67, 95% CI 4.11–243.98). Furthermore, the CRC group experienced higher odds of cesarean section (AOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05–3.03), preterm birth (AOR 4.16, 95% CI 2.05–8.47), and intrauterine death (AOR 13.18, 95% CI 3.33–52.16). Distinct differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes were observed based on the location of CRC. Pregnant patients with CRC faced higher hospital charges and had longer hospital stays during delivery hospitalization compared to those without CRC.ConclusionPregnant patients with CRC are at increased risk for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, emphasizing the importance of early detection, timely intervention, and comprehensive management during pregnancy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05248-2.","BackgroundGlioma is the most common primary intracranial tumor. It is notorious for its high degree of malignancy, strong invasion, and poor prognosis. The transmembrane emp24 trafficking protein 3 (TMED3) belongs to the TMED family, which is responsible for intracellular protein transport and innate immune signal transmission. More and more evidence shows that TMED3 plays a key role in the tumor progression of human cancer. However, the role and potential molecular mechanism of TMED3 in glioma have not been clarified.MethodsTMED3 expression levels, clinical data, survival prognosis, prediction of upstream miRNA, and immune-related analyses were all analyzed utilizing relevant databases. Finally, a molecular cell experiment confirmed TMED3 expression in glioma.ResultsWe discovered that TMED3 is overexpressed in most tumors, including gliomas, and is associated with tumor staging and prognosis. Subsequently, a combination of a series of bioinformatics analyses, including correlation and survival analyses, identified miR-1296-5p as the most potent upstream miRNA of TMED3 in gliomas.Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between TMED3 level and tumor immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression.ConclusionTMED3 is highly expressed in gliomas and is associated with tumor staging and affects the prognosis of patients. Therefore, the TMED3 gene may be a potential immunotherapy target and prognostic marker for gliomas.",0
"SummaryIn 2010, modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria were proposed as a way of adapting the RECIST criteria to the particularities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We intended to overcome some limitations of RECIST in measuring tumour shrinkage with local and systemic therapies, and also to refine the assessment of progression that could be misinterpreted with conventional RECIST 1.1, due to clinical events related to the natural progression of chronic liver disease (development of ascites, enlargement of lymph nodes, etc.). mRECIST has served its purpose since being adopted or included in clinical practice guidelines (European, American and Asian) for the management of HCC; it has also been instrumental for assessing response and time-to-event endpoints in several phase II and III investigations. Nowadays, mRECIST has become the standard tool for measurement of radiological endpoints at early/intermediate stages of HCC. At advanced stages, guidelines recommend both methods. mRECIST has been proven to capture higher objective response rates in tumours treated with molecular therapies and those responses have shown to be independently associated with better survival. With the advent of novel treatment approaches (that is immunotherapy) and combination therapies there is a need to further refine and clarify some concepts around the performance of mRECIST. Similarly, changes in the landscape of standard of care at advanced stages of the disease are pointing towards progression-free survival as a potential primary endpoint in some phase III investigations, as effective therapies applied beyond progression might mask overall survival results. Strict recommendations for adopting this endpoint have been reported. Overall, we review the performance of mRECIST during the last decade, incorporating novel clarifications and refinements in light of emerging challenges in the study and management of HCC.","ObjectiveTo search for human protein-coding genes related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and perform prognosis risk assessment.MethodsGenes related to HBV-HCC were selected through literature screening and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network database analysis. Prognosis potential genes (PPGs) were identified using Cox regression analysis. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on PPGs, and risk scores were calculated. Kaplan–Meier plots were used to analyze overall survival rates, and the results were predicted based on clinicopathological variables. Association analysis was also conducted with immune infiltration, immune therapy, and drug sensitivity. Experimental verification of the expression of PPGs was done in patient liver cancer tissue and normal liver tissue adjacent to tumors.ResultsThe use of a prognosis potential genes risk assessment model can reliably predict the prognosis risk of patients, demonstrating strong predictive ability. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the overall survival rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than that of the high-risk group. There were significant differences between the two subgroups in terms of immune infiltration and IC50 association analysis. Experimental verification revealed that CYP2C19, FLNC, and HNRNPC were highly expressed in liver cancer tissue, while UBE3A was expressed at a lower level.ConclusionPPGs can be used to predict the prognosis risk of HBV-HCC patients and play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. They also reveal their potential role in the tumor immune microenvironment, clinical-pathological characteristics, and prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04989-4.",0
"Introduction:Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are treated with surgery-based multimodality approach or definitive chemoradiation therapy plus durvalumab consolidation. It is not clear whether surgery-based multimodality therapy has any survival advantage over definitive chemoradiation plus immunotherapy consolidation.Method:National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify NSCLC patients at stage IIIA (AJCC8, T3N1/T4N0–1 or T1N2/T2N2) who are treated with surgery-based multimodality approach or definitive chemoradiation plus durvalumab. Survival between groups were compared using inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results were independently confirmed by Landmark Inverse and Clone Censor Weight analyses to address immortal time bias.Results:From 2017 to 2019, 24,170 patients are identified as potentially resectable stage IIIA (T3N1, T4N0–1, T1N2/T2N2). Among them, 2,615 (10.8%) received surgery-based multimodality therapy and 2,985 (12.4%) received definitive chemoradiation plus durvalumab. Surgery based multimodality approach had significant survival advantage over definitive chemoradiation plus durvalumab (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.69–0.79, P < .001). The median overall survival (mOS) for the definitive chemoradiation plus durvalumab group was 48.59 m whereas mOS was not reached for surgery-based multimodality group. This trend persisted in both N2 negative and positive tumors. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was just as effective as adjuvant chemotherapy and delay of immunotherapy consolidation to 12 weeks after initiation of chemoradiation did not negatively affect survival outcome.Conclusion:For stage IIIA NSCLC patients, surgery-based multimodality treatment outperformed chemoradiation plus durvalumab in survival.","SummaryBackgroundMycobacterium tuberculosis is the main causative agent of tuberculosis. BCG, the only licensed vaccine, provides inadequate protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. Controlled human infection models are useful tools for vaccine development. We aimed to determine a safe dose of aerosol-inhaled live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG as a surrogate for M tuberculosis infection, then compare the safety and tolerability of infection models established using aerosol-inhaled and intradermally administered BCG.MethodsThis phase 1 controlled human infection trial was conducted at two clinical research facilities in the UK. Healthy, immunocompetent adults aged 18–50 years, who were both M tuberculosis-naive and BCG-naive and had no history of asthma or other respiratory diseases, were eligible for the trial. Participants were initially enrolled into group 1 (receiving the BCG Danish strain); the trial was subsequently paused because of a worldwide shortage of BCG Danish and, after protocol amendment, was restarted using the BCG Bulgaria strain (group 2). After a dose-escalation study, during which participants were sequentially allocated to receive either 1 × 103, 1 × 104, 1 × 105, 1 × 106, or 1 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) of aerosol BCG, the maximum tolerated dose was selected for the randomised controlled trial. Participants in this trial were randomly assigned (9:12), by variable block randomisation and using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes, to receive aerosol BCG (1 × 107 CFU) and intradermal saline or intradermal BCG (1 × 106 CFU) and aerosol saline. Participants were masked to treatment allocation until day 14. The primary outcome was to compare the safety of a controlled human infection model based on aerosol-inhaled BCG versus one based on intradermally administered BCG, and the secondary outcome was to evaluate BCG recovery in the airways of participants who received aerosol BCG or skin biopsies of participants who received intradermal BCG. BCG was detected by culture and by PCR. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02709278, and is complete.FindingsParticipants were assessed for eligibility between April 7, 2016, and Sept 29, 2018. For group 1, 15 participants were screened, of whom 13 were enrolled and ten completed the study; for group 2, 60 were screened and 33 enrolled, all of whom completed the study. Doses up to 1 × 107 CFU aerosol-inhaled BCG were sufficiently well tolerated. No significant difference was observed in the frequency of adverse events between aerosol and intradermal groups (median percentage of solicited adverse events per participant, post-aerosol vs post-intradermal BCG: systemic 7% [IQR 2–11] vs 4% [1–13], p=0·62; respiratory 7% [1–19] vs 4% [1–9], p=0·56). More severe systemic adverse events occurred in the 2 weeks after aerosol BCG (15 [12%] of 122 reported systemic adverse events) than after intradermal BCG (one [1%] of 94; difference 11% [95% CI 5–17]; p=0·0013), but no difference was observed in the severity of respiratory adverse events (two [1%] of 144 vs zero [0%] of 97; 1% [−1 to 3]; p=0·52). All adverse events after aerosol BCG resolved spontaneously. One serious adverse event was reported—a participant in group 2 was admitted to hospital to receive analgesia for a pre-existing ovarian cyst, which was deemed unrelated to BCG infection. On day 14, BCG was cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage samples after aerosol infection and from skin biopsy samples after intradermal infection.InterpretationThis first-in-human aerosol BCG controlled human infection model was sufficiently well tolerated. Further work will evaluate the utility of this model in assessing vaccine efficacy and identifying potential correlates of protection.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley Clinical Research Network, and TBVAC2020.",0
"BACKGROUND:Differentiating brain metastasis progression from radiation effects or radiation necrosis (RN) remains challenging. Golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI provides high spatial and temporal resolution to analyze tissue enhancement, which may differ between tumor progression (TP) and RN.OBJECTIVE:To investigate the utility of longitudinal GRASP MRI in distinguishing TP from RN after gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS:We retrospectively evaluated 48 patients with brain metastasis managed with SRS at our institution from 2013 to 2020 who had GRASP MRI before and at least once after SRS. TP (n = 16) was pathologically confirmed. RN (n = 16) was diagnosed on either resected tissue without evidence of tumor or on lesion resolution on follow-up. As a reference, we included a separate group of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer that showed favorable response with tumor control and without RN on subsequent imaging (n = 16). Mean contrast washin and washout slopes normalized to the superior sagittal sinus were compared between groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine diagnostic performance.RESULTS:After SRS, progression showed a significantly steeper washin slope than RN on all 3 follow-up scans (scan 1: 0.29 ± 0.16 vs 0.18 ± 0.08, P = .021; scan 2: 0.35 ± 0.19 vs 0.18 ± 0.09, P = .004; scan 3: 0.32 ± 0.12 vs 0.17 ± 0.07, P = .002). No significant differences were found in the post-SRS washout slope. Post-SRS washin slope differentiated progression and RN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74, a sensitivity of 75%, and a specificity of 69% on scan 1; an AUC of 0.85, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 69% on scan 2; and an AUC of 0.87, a sensitivity of 63%, and a specificity of 100% on scan 3.CONCLUSION:Longitudinal GRASP MRI may help to differentiate metastasis progression from RN.","Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine whether MRI radiomic features of key cerebral structures differ between women and men, and whether detection of such differences depends on the image resolution.Materials and Methods:Ultrahigh resolution (UHR) 3D MP2RAGE (magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo) T1-weighted MR images (voxel size, 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm3) of the brain of 30 subjects (18 women and 12 men; mean age, 39.0 ± 14.8 years) without abnormal findings on MRI were retrospectively included. MRI was performed on a whole-body 7 T MR system. A convolutional neural network was used to segment the following structures: frontal cortex, frontal white matter, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and corpus callosum. Eighty-seven radiomic features were extracted respectively: gray-level histogram (n = 18), co-occurrence matrix (n = 24), run-length matrix (n = 16), size-zone matrix (n = 16), and dependence matrix (n = 13). Feature extraction was performed at UHR and, additionally, also after resampling to 1.4 × 1.4 × 1.4 mm3 voxel size (standard clinical resolution). Principal components (PCs) of radiomic features were calculated, and independent samples t tests with Cohen d as effect size measure were used to assess differences in PCs between women and men for the different cerebral structures.Results:At UHR, at least a single PC differed significantly between women and men in 6/7 cerebral structures: frontal cortex (d = −0.79, P = 0.042 and d = −1.01, P = 0.010), frontal white matter (d = −0.81, P = 0.039), thalamus (d = 1.43, P < 0.001), globus pallidus (d = 0.92, P = 0.020), caudate nucleus (d = −0.83, P = 0.039), and corpus callosum (d = −0.97, P = 0.039). At standard clinical resolution, only a single PC extracted from the corpus callosum differed between sexes (d = 1.05, P = 0.009).Conclusions:Nonnegligible differences in radiomic features of several key structures of the brain exist between women and men, and need to be accounted for. Very high spatial resolution may be required to uncover and further investigate the sexual dimorphism of brain structures on MRI.",1
"AbstractStandard of care (SOC) for ndGBM begins with maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and maintenance temozolomide. IGV-001 is an autologous biologic-device combination immunotherapy for the treatment of ndGBM that consists of autologous GBM tumor cells and an antisense oligonucleotide against IGF-1R mRNA, irradiated and administered via biodiffusion chambers implanted in the abdomen. In a phase 1b study, IGV-001 was well tolerated without unexpected adverse events in subjects with ndGBM. Multiple efficacy signals were observed, including significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), radiographic evidence of tumor response, and changes in immune response biomarkers. Here, we present early safety data from the phase 2b randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT04485949) designed to assess efficacy and safety of IGV-001 in subjects with ndGBM across 20 sites in the United States. After surgical resection, subjects were randomized 2:1 and treated with IGV-001 or placebo followed by SOC. The primary outcome is PFS, defined as the time from randomization to first progression, as determined by blinded central radiology review, or death. Secondary outcomes include OS, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause, and safety. As of May 22, 2024, 99 subjects were randomized and 95 implanted with IGV-001 or placebo plus SOC. A total of 39/45 (86.7%) subjects had sufficient follow-up time after initiated treatment with concurrent radiation and temozolomide. Nine of 72 randomized (12.5%) discontinued treatment, including 7 who stopped during the SOC treatment period. None ceased treatment for adverse events, protocol deviations, or death. A total of 11/72 (15.3%) randomized subjects discontinued the study after randomization. A review of blinded safety data did not show any emerging risk and supports no change to the benefit-risk profile of IGV-001 versus placebo. Updated data will be presented.","Although small-molecule inhibitors with moderate efficacy targeting MYC have been previously described, to this point, research efforts have failed to bring a suitable small-molecule MYC inhibitor to the clinic. Herein, the discovery of a series of novel MYC degraders bearing VHL to target the “undruggable” MYC is presented. The molecules are based on connecting a known MYC binder to a VHL ligand or pomalidomide to induce MYC degradation in various cancer cells known to express MYC. Representative compounds from our work induced MYC degradation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Selected compounds, CSI86 and CSI107, displayed antiproliferative activity (IC50 values of 13–18 μM) against breast and prostate cancer cells. The lead molecules were further evaluated in terms of cell uptake, potential to degrade MYC, and pharmacokinetics in mice. Encouraging results presented herein suggest that the presented analogs may serve as prototype structures of future therapeutic agents for the treatment of MYC-dependent tumors. MYC protein degraders can well complement the more established inhibition approaches that have been presented in the past (for example, disruption of the MYC–MAX complex formation by small-molecule inhibitors).",0

Initial data suggest shorter survival for patients with basal tumors and differing treatment sensitivity to FOLFIRINOX (FFX) and gemcitabine nab-Paclitaxel (GnP) by transcriptional subtype.Experimental Design:We examined 8,743 patients with RNA sequencing from PCs performed at Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ). Classical and basal subtypes were identified using PurIST algorithm on RNA-sequencing and two cohorts were analyzed:  Biomarker cohort included patients with complete molecular profiling data (n = 7,250);  Outcomes cohort included patients with metastatic disease with available survival outcomes (n=5,335). 3,842 patients were shared between the two cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess patient survival.Results:In the biomarker cohort, 3,063 tumors (42.2%) were strongly classical (SC), and 2,015 tumors (27.8%) were strongly basal (SB). SC and SB tumors showed strong associations with histologic phenotypes and biopsy site. SB tumors had higher rates of KRAS, TP53, and ARID1A mutations, lower rates of SMAD4 mutation, and transcriptional evidence of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Sixty of 77 cases (78%) maintained their transcriptional subtype between temporally and/or spatially disparate lesions. In the outcomes cohort, SB subtype was associated with shorter overall survival time, regardless of whether they received FFX or GnP as first line chemotherapy. Mutant KRAS allele type was prognostic of outcomes, however this impact was restricted to SC tumors, whereas all mutant KRAS alleles had similarly poor outcomes in SB tumors.Conclusions:SB subtype is a strong independent predictor of worse outcomes, irrespective of upfront chemotherapy regimen. Clinical trials should further investigate PC transcriptional subtypes as a prognostic and predictive biomarker.",0
"BackgroundSome chemotherapy drugs have immunomodulatory effects on specific tumors. The potential of vincristine (VCR) in the R-CHOP regimen to act as both a chemotherapeutic and an immunomodulatory agent via PD-L1 in tumor cells remains unclear.MethodsIn vitro screening VCR showed that the IC50 value of VCR in the DLBCL cell lines was approximately 2 nM. Western blotting and q-PCR were used to detect the expression of PD-L1. The effect of VCR combined with PD-L1 mAb was tested in a co-culture system of LY-OCI-3 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in DLBCL xenograft mouse model. Flow cytometry was used to determine the proportion of T lymphocyte subsets. The effect of the STAT3 inhibitor nifuroxazide on VCR-induced PD-L1 expression was tested in LY-OCI-3 and SU-DHL-4 cells.ResultsVCR upregulated PD-L1 protein and mRNA expression in various DLBCL cell lines. PD-L1 Ab combined with VCR significantly increased the proportion of CD8 + Granzyme B + , INF-γ + or TNF-α + CD3 + T cells. VCR + PD-L1 Ab inhibited tumor growth more effectively than VCR monotherapy, whereas PD-L1 Ab alone had no significant effect. Survival time did not differ significantly between the PD-L1 Ab group and the control group, whereas it was significantly longer in the VCR monotherapy and combination groups which showed more longer survival compared with the former. Nifuroxazide downregulated p-STAT3 and PD-L1 protein levels.ConclusionsVCR upregulated PD-L1 expression in DLBCL cells partially by promoting the p-STAT3; VCR combined with PD-L1 Ab activated effector T cells and increased the antitumor immune response in vitro and in vivo.","PurposeProgrammed death ligand 1(PD-L1)/programmed cell death-1(PD-1) inhibitors have shown promising efficacy in unresectable patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the results are not consistent. Our goal was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors or plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody or anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of unresectable HCC.MethodsCochrane library, Embase, and PubMed were searched till August 2021. Data on progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and disease control rate (DCR) were pooled and analyzed by Stata14 software.ResultsThirteen prospective trials with 2,386 HCC patients were included. Pooled analysis estimated an ORR of about 0.21 (95% CI = 0.18–0.25) and a DCR of 0.59 (95% CI = 0.52–0.65) for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Summary PFS was 4.19 (95% CI = 3.31–5.18) months and summary OS was 13.23 (95% CI = 12.06–14.41) months. After using PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors plus anti-VEGF agents, ORR was 0.26 (95% CI = 0.20–0.33), DCR was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.69–0.81) and PFS was 6.2 (95% CI = 4.61–7.78) months. PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy achieved an ORR of 0.23 (95% CI = 0.14–0.33), an DCR of 0.44 (95% CI = 0.39–0.50) and a PFS of 1.88 (95% CI = 1.51–2.26).ConclusionsPD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors were effective and tolerable in patients with advanced HCC. Furthermore, compared with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy, PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors plus anti-VEGF agents resulted in more clinical improvements in ORR, DCR, and PFS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04057-3.",1
"Ovarian cancers are a complex and heterogenic group of malignancies that are difficult to detect, diagnose and treat. Fortunately, considerable knowledge of ovarian cancer specific biomarkers has been generated, that is pertinent to the development of novel theranostic platforms by combining therapies and diagnostics. Genomic and proteomic data has been invaluable in providing critical biomolecular targets for ovarian cancer theranostic approaches. Exploitation of the wealth of biomarker research that has been conducted offers viable targets as beacons for ovarian cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic targeting. These markers can be used in theranostics, a treatment strategy that combines therapy and diagnostics and is common in nuclear medicine, where radionuclides are used for both diagnosis and treatment. The development of theranostics has taken substantial focus in recent years in the battle against ovarian cancer. Yet to date only one theranostic technology has emerged in clinical practice. However, given the wealth of ovarian cancer biomarkers the field is poised to see the emergence of revolutionary disease treatment and monitoring outcomes through their incorporation into the development of theranostic strategies. The future of ovarian cancer treatment is set to enable precise diagnosis, targeted treatment, and vigilant monitoring. This review aims to assess the status of ovarian cancer diagnostic tools and biomarkers in practice, clinical development, or pre-clinical development, highlighting newly emerging theranostic applications.","Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a notoriously difficult disease to treat, and many of the existing TNBC chemotherapeutics lack tumor selectivity and the capability for simultaneously visualizing and monitoring their own activity in the biological context. However, TNBC cells have been known to generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). To this end, three novel small molecule theranostics 1a, 1c, and 2 consisting of both H2O2-responsive nitrogen mustard prodrug and profluorophore character have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated as targeted cancer therapeutics and bioimaging agents. The three theranostics comprise of boronate esters that deactivate nitrogen mustard functional groups and fluorophores but allow their selective activation through H2O2-specific oxidative deboronation for the release of the active drug and fluorophore. The three theranostics demonstrated H2O2-inducible DNA-alkylating capability and fluorescence turn-on properties in addition to selective anticancer activity. They are particularly effective in killing TNBC MDA-MB-468 cells with high H2O2 level while safe to normal epithelial MCF-10A cell. The conjugated boron-masked fluorophores in 1c and 2 are highly responsive towards H2O2, which enabled tracking of the theranostics in living cellular mitochondria and nucleus organelles. The three theranostics 1a, 1c, and 2 are capable of both selective release of the active drug to take effect in H2O2-rich cancer sites and simultaneously monitoring its activity. This single molecule system is of utmost importance to understand the function, efficacy, and mechanism of the H2O2-activated prodrugs and theranostics within the living recipient.",1
"PurposeRadiotherapy is an integral treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, radiation-induced toxicities such as radiation pneumonitis (RP) present a considerable challenge. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the potential of salivary metabolomics as an independent risk factor for predicting RP.MethodsThis study included 62 consecutive patients with NSCLC who underwent thoracic radiotherapy at Tokyo Medical University between September 2016 and December 2018. The median age of the patients was 75 years (range: 41–89), comprising 47 (75.8%) males and 15 (24.2%) females. Patients with stage I NSCLC received 75 Gy in 30 fractions, whereas those with stage II and III NSCLC received 66 Gy in 33 fractions. Saliva samples were collected before treatment and at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after initiating radiotherapy. Clinical RP was defined as grade 2 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events. Salivary metabolomics were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Salivary metabolites were evaluated as potential predictors of RP.ResultsClinical RP was observed in 11 patients (17.7%); no RP-related deaths were observed. Clinical RP developed at a median of 4 months (range: 2–6 months) after initiating radiotherapy. Three metabolites, butyrate, propionate, and hexanoate, collected before radiotherapy exhibited predictive ability for clinical RP. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated butyrate (P = 0.033) as a predictive factor, along with the previously known factor of lung volume irradiated with > 20 Gy (P = 0.045).ConclusionSalivary metabolite butyrate was an independent risk factor for clinical RP.","BackgroundLiver resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) while the postoperative prognosis varies greatly, with no recognized biomarker. We aimed to identify the plasma metabolomic biomarkers that could be used for preoperative risk stratification of ICC patients.Methods108 eligible ICC patients who underwent radical surgical resection between August 2012 and October 2020 were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into a discovery cohort (n = 76) and a validation cohort (n = 32) by 7:3. Metabolomics profiling of preoperative plasma was performed and clinical data were collected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, Cox regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to screen and validate the survival-related metabolic biomarker panel and construct a LASSO-Cox prediction model.Results10 survival-related metabolic biomarkers were used for construction of a LASSO-Cox prediction model. In the discovery and validation cohorts, the LASSO-Cox prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.876 (95%CI: 0.777–0.974) and 0.860 (95%CI: 0.711–1.000) in evaluating 1-year OS of ICC patients, respectively. The OS of ICC patients in the high-risk group was significantly worse than that in the low-risk group (discovery cohort, p < 0.0001; validation cohort: p = 0.041). Also, the LASSO-Cox risk score (HR 2.43, 95%CI: 1.81–3.26, p < 0.0001) was a significant independent risk factor associated with OS.ConclusionsThe LASSO-Cox prediction model has potential as an important tool in evaluating the OS of ICC patients after surgical resection and can be used as prediction tools to implement the best treatment options that could result in better outcomes.",1
"BackgroundMedical financial hardship is an increasingly common consequence of cancer treatment and can lead to food insecurity. However, food security status is not routinely assessed in the health care setting, and the prevalence of food insecurity among cancer survivors is unknown.ObjectiveThis scoping review aimed to identify the prevalence of food insecurity among cancer survivors in the United States before the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsFive databases (PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL [Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature], Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) were systematically searched for articles that reported on food security status among US patients receiving active cancer treatment or longer-term cancer survivors and were published between January 2015 and December 2020.ResultsAmong the 15 articles meeting the inclusion criteria, overall food insecurity prevalence ranged from 4.0% among women presenting to a gynecologic oncology clinic to 83.6% among patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers. Excluding studies focused specifically on Federally Qualified Health Center patients, prevalence of food insecurity ranged from 4.0% to 26.2%, which overlaps the food insecurity prevalence in the general US population during the same time period (range, 10.5% to 14.9%). Women were more likely than men to report being food insecure, and the prevalence of food insecurity was higher among Hispanic and Black patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients.ConclusionsGiven significant heterogeneity in study populations and sample sizes, it was not possible to estimate an overall food insecurity prevalence among cancer survivors in the United States. Routine surveillance of food security status and other social determinants of health is needed to better detect and address these issues.","Objective.Social determinants of health (SDOH) impact cancer outcomes. The CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) integrates scores for four neighborhood-based SDOH domains (socioeconomic status, household characteristics, minority status, and housing type/transportation) to assess neighborhood social vulnerability (NSV). While NSV has been associated with overall cancer mortality and lung, breast, colon, and endometrial cancer-specific mortality, the relationship between NSV as defined by the SVI and ovarian cancer outcomes remains unknown.Methods.We used data from 177 patients enrolled in an observational ovarian cancer cohort study from October 2012 through September 2022. All patients underwent debulking surgery and completed an entire course of standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy. Follow-up was completed through May 2024. SVI was calculated using census tract at diagnosis. High NSV was defined as SVI in the top quartile of the cohort. Cox proportional hazard models assessed the association between NSV and progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival.Results.After accounting for demographic and clinical factors, high NSV was associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:2.31 [95% CI:1.48–3.61]; P < 0.001) and OS (HR:1.79 [95% CI:1.10–2.92]; P = 0.02), with neighborhood socioeconomic status associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:2.29 [95% CI:1.47–3.56]; P < 0.001) and OS (HR:1.71 [95% CI:1.04–2.80]; P = 0.03). Neighborhood housing type/transportation was also associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:1.65 [95% CI:1.07–2.55]; P = 0.02) and trended towards worse OS (HR:1.43 [95% CI:0.80–2.33]).Conclusion and relevance.Higher neighborhood social vulnerability is associated with worse outcomes among ovarian cancer patients. Validating these results in a population-based cohort and assessing programs to reduce neighborhood social vulnerability to improve ovarian cancer outcomes is warranted.",1
"AbstractTheranostics is a new treatment modality integrating molecular imaging with targeted radionuclide therapy. Theranostic agents have received regulatory approval for some systemic cancers and have therapeutic potential in neuro-oncology. As clinical trials are developed to evaluate the efficacy of theranostic agents in brain tumors, specific considerations will have to be considered, taking into account lessons learned from previous studies examining other treatment modalities in neuro-oncology. These include the need for molecular imaging or surgical window-of-opportunity studies to confirm adequate passage across the blood-brain barrier, optimize eligibility criteria, and selection of the most appropriate response criteria and endpoints to address issues such as pseudoprogression. This review will discuss some of the issues that should be considered when designing clinical trials for theranostic agents.","ABSTRACTExtracellular Vesicles (EVs) became a focus of clinical research when experimental and pre-clinical studies showed that they mimic their parent cells’ regenerative and therapeutic effects and their cargo carries disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Since the publication of data forms an endpoint of the study, this review specifically focused on the published clinical trials done with EVs. For brevity, this review was restricted to the last 10 years. Unexpectedly, the literature search showed that very few clinical trials assessing the therapeutic applications of EVs were published in this period indicating that they have not reached their desired endpoint. Conversely, most studies showed the potential of EVs present in various biofluids as a promising source of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for various diseases, and predictive markers to assess the effectiveness of therapy. This stark difference in the numbers could perhaps be due to the time-consuming regulatory processes involved in the clinical-grade preparation and characterization of EVs, and the determination of their safety and effective dose regimens. One wonders whether fast-tracking regulatory affairs could help accelerate the therapeutic use of EVs. This aspect needs urgent attention.",1
"AbstractThe post COVID-19 pandemic era has emerged with more efficient vaccines, all based on genetic materials. However, to expand the use of nucleic components as vaccines, a new generation of nanosystems particularly constructed to increase RNA/DNA stability, half-life and facilitate administration are still required. This review highlights novel developments in mRNA and pDNA vaccines formulated into nanostructures exclusively composed by biopolymeric materials. Recent advances suggest that a new generation of vaccines may arise by adapting the structural features of biopolymers with the effectiveness of nucleic acids. The advantages offered by biopolymers, such as increased stability and targeting ability may cause a revolution in the immunization field for offering promptly adaptable and effective formulations for worldwide distribution.","CLIC5 encoded protein associates with actin-based cytoskeletal and is increasingly thought to play significant roles in human cancers. We use TCGA and GEO to explore CLIC5 expression differences, mutation and DNA methylation, TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration. We verified the mRNA expression of CLIC5 in human ovarian cancer cells by real-time PCR and detected the expression of CLIC5 as well as immune marker genes in ovarian cancer by immunohistochemistry. The pan-cancer analysis showed that CLIC5 is highly expressed in several malignant tumors. In some cancers, CLIC5 expression in tumor samples is associated with poorer overall survival. For example, patients with ovarian cancer with high expression of CLIC5 have a poor prognosis. CLIC5 mutation frequency increased in all tumor types. The CLIC5 promoter is hypomethylated in most tumors. CLIC5 was associated with tumor immunity and different immune cells of different tumor types, such as CD8 + T cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, etc. CLIC5 was positively correlated with various immune checkpoints, and TMB and MSI were correlated with dysregulation of CLIC5 in tumors. The expression of CLIC5 in ovarian cancer was detected by qPCR and IHC, and the results were consistent with the bioinformatics results. There were a strong positive correlation between CLIC5 expression and M2 macrophage (CD163) infiltration and a negative correlation with CD8 + T-cell infiltration. In conclusions, our first pan-cancer analysis offered a detailed grasp of the cancerogenic functions of CLIC5 in a variety of malignancies. CLIC5 participated in immunomodulation and performed a crucial function in the tumor microenvironment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04927-4.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown limited success in patients with solid tumors. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have shown that adrenoceptor beta-2 (ADRB2) is a novel checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. To inhibit ADRB2-mediated inhibitory signaling, we downregulated ADRB2 in CAR-T (shβ2-CAR-T) cells via RNA interference, assessed different parameters, and compared them with conventional second-generation CAR-T cells. ADRB2 knockdown CAR-T cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, by increasing CD69, CD107a, GzmB, IFN-γ, T-bet, and GLUT-1. In addition, ADRB2 deficiency led to improved proliferation, increased CD8/CD4 T cell ratio, and decreased apoptosis in CAR-T cells. shβ2-CAR-T cells expressed more Bcl-2 and led to the generation of more significant proportions of T central memory cells. Finally, the ZAP-70/NF-κB signaling axis was shown to be responsible for the improved functions of novel CAR-T cells. In tumor-bearing mice, shβ2-CAR-T cells performed better than conventional CAR-T cells in eradicating prostate tumors. The study provides the basis for future clinical and translational CAR-T cell research to focus on adrenergic stress-mediated challenges in the tumor microenvironment of stressed tumors.","ABSTRACTWilms tumor (WT) is the most common malignant tumor of the urinary system in children. Though the traditional treatment of surgery plus radiotherapy and chemotherapy achieves exciting clinical efficacy, in relapsed and refractory cases, the long-term overall survival rates are poor. Besides, chemotherapy and radiation have serious long-term toxic side effects on children. Cancer immunotherapy is a new tumor therapy that works by activating the body's immune system to allow immune cells to kill tumor cells more efficiently. Currently, cancer immunotherapy has been tested in clinical trials or basic studies in WT. This article reviews the current status of clinical trials and basic research of cancer immunotherapy in WT to promote the application of cancer immunotherapy in WT patients.",1
"BackgroundDNA-directed RNA polymerase (DDRP) related genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the development of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Therefore, we aimed to construct a DDRP-associated lncRNA model to predict the prognosis of LUAD and to evaluate its sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy.MethodsTo construct a predictive signature, we used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, as well as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. The prognostic model was verified by applying the ROC curve analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis, GO/KEGG analysis, and a predictive nomogram. Eventually, immunotherapy and drug susceptibility were examined and stemness indices were analyzed.Results24 DDRP-associated lncRNAs were found as independent prognosis factors, which may be further developed as potential therapeutic vaccines for LUAD. The area under the ROC curve and the conformance index showed that the constructed model can predict the prognosis of LUAD patients. The predicted incidences of overall survival showed perfect conformance. And there were significant changes in immunological markers between the two risk subgroups in the model. Finally, an analysis of 50% maximum inhibitory concentration between the two risk subgroups showed that the high-risk subgroup was more sensitive to certain chemotherapy drugs.ConclusionWe constructed a model that accurately predicts the outcomes of LUAD based on 24 DDRP-related lncRNAs and provided promising treatment options for the future.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05118-x.","BackgroundThe FXYD family of ion transport regulators have emerged as important modulators of cancer progression and metastasis. However, their expression and roles in ovarian cancer (OCa) have not been systematically investigated.MethodsThe expression of FXYD genes in OCa was analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as well as independent clinical samples. The prognostic values of FXYD genes were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis. To explore potential mechanisms, bioinformatics approaches including Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway analysis, GSEA and drug sensitivity correlation analysis were performed. OCa cell lines overexpressing FXYD1, FXYD5 or FXYD7 were also generated and their impacts on proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed.ResultsFXYD1 and FXYD6 were significantly downregulated while FXYD3, FXYD4 and FXYD5 were upregulated in OCa tissues compared to normal tissues. FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 were independent adverse prognostic factors for OCa patients. Pathway and drug correlation analysis revealed that FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 genes regulated diverse oncogenic signaling cascades and modulated the response to various chemotherapeutic agents. Overexpression of FXYD1, FXYD5 or FXYD7 enhanced OCa cell motility and invasiveness in vitro.ConclusionOur results demonstrate aberrant expression patterns, prognostic values, and oncogenic activities of FXYD genes in OCa. FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this disease. Targeting FXYD-mediated signaling represents a promising therapeutic strategy against OCa.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05445-z.",1
"ABSTRACTEpithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a member of the small hydrophobic membrane protein subfamily. EMP1 is aberrantly expressed in various tumor tissues and governs multiple cellular behaviors (for example, proliferation, differentiation, and migration). The resultant regulation of the cancer pathway is responsible for the metastasis of cancer cells and determines the risk of malignant tumor progression. This review provides an updated overview of EMP1 as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor contingent on the cancer type and summarizes its upstream regulators and downstream target genes. This systematic review summarizes our current understanding of the role of EMP1 in malignant tumor development, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for its potential use as the biomarker and therapeutic target.","The utilization of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, specifically anti-PD-1/L1 agents, prior to radical cystectomy is an emerging paradigm in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). In situ vaccination represents a strategy to manipulate the tumor in order to augment the immune response toward improved local and distant cancer control. The authors describe the study rationale, design and objectives for RAD VACCINE MIBC, a single-arm, single-institution, phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of combination neoadjuvant sasanlimab (humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1) with stereotactic body radiotherapy as an in situ vaccine in cisplatin-ineligible patients with MIBC. The results from this trial will establish the safety profile of this combination strategy and evaluate pathologic complete response rates.",0
"PurposeAtezolizumab has been shown to be effective and safe in randomized trial in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, there are limited real-life data on atezolizumab. In this study, we aimed to determine the real-life efficacy and safety of atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.MethodsThis trial is a retrospective multicenter study of the Turkish Oncology Group, which included extensive-stage SCLC patients who received atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy in a first-line treatment. The characteristics of the patients, treatment and response rates, and PFS and OS are presented. Factors associated with PFS and OS were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis.ResultsA total of 213 patients at the 30 oncology centers were included. The median number of chemotherapy cycle was 5 (1–8) and atezolizumab cycle was 7 (1–32). After median 11.9 months of follow-up, median PFS and OS was 6.8 months (95%CI 5.7–7.8), and 11.9 months (95%CI 11–12.7), respectively. The ORR was 61.9%. ECOG-PS (p = 0.002) and number of metastatic sites (p = 0.001) were associated with PFS and pack-year of smoking (p = 0.05), while ECOG-PS (p = 0.03) and number of metastatic sites (p = 0.001) were associated with OS. Hematological side effects were common and toxicities were manageable.ConclusionThis real-life data confirm the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have brought new hope for the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) over the past decades. However, the overall response rate is limited, and is lower than that in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This is in part because of the lack of pre-existing tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TITLs), especially cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), in the SCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in insufficient anti-tumor immune response. To unleash the full potential of ICIs, the trafficking and infiltration of TITLs to the tumor is necessary and tightly regulated, the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment blunts the infiltration and function of TITLs that reach the tumor in SCLC. Here, we review the characteristics of TITLs, the effects of various factors on T cell infiltration, and possible strategies to restore or promote T cell infiltration in the TME of SCLC.",1
"PurposeThe current evaluation methods for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly CD8 + TILs, mainly rely on semiquantitative immunohistochemistry with high variability. We aimed to construct an individualized DNA methylation-based signature for CD8 + TILs (CD8 + MeTIL) that may characterize melanoma immune microenvironment and guide therapeutic selection.MethodsThe transcriptome profiles and DNA methylation data of 457 melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed. Differential methylation analysis between groups with high and low CD8 + TILs was performed to select differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and define CD8 + MeTIL. The prognostic value of CD8 + MeTIL and its predictive value for immunotherapy response were investigated using multiple melanoma cohorts.ResultsWe successfully constructed the CD8 + MeTIL signature based on four DMPs. The survival analyses showed that higher CD8 + MeTIL score was associated with worse survival outcomes in TCGA-SKCM and GSE144487 cohorts. The ROC curve for the predictive analysis revealed that the survival prediction of CD8 + MeTIL score was superior compared with CD8 + TILs (CIBERSORT) and CD8B mRNA expression. Furthermore, we founded that tumors with higher CD8 + MeTIL score were marked with immunosuppressive characteristics, including low immune score and downregulated immune-related pathways. More importantly, the CD8 + MeTIL score showed a potential predictive value for the benefit from immunotherapy in two published cohorts. When combined CD8 + MeTIL with PD-L1 expression, the patient classification showed significantly different immunotherapy response rates and long-term survival outcomes.ConclusionsThe CD8 + MeTIL signature might be as a novel method to evaluate CD8 + TILs and guide immunotherapy approaches.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04566-1.","BackgroundLncRNAs and DNA methylation are both key regulators of tumorigenesis and immune regulation. However, the interaction between lncRNA and DNA methylation, their regulation and their clinical and immune relevance in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, we identified DNA methylation regulator-related lncRNAs through Pearson correlation analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Univariate Cox regression was used to screen DNA methylationrelated prognostic lncRNAs. Further, through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression, a prognostic model based on 13 lncRNAs was established. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis verified the accuracy of the model in predicting the survival of GC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses also confirmed that the risk score obtained from the risk model could be applied as an independent prognostic factor for patients with GC. Furthermore, based on the risk score and other clinicopathological characteristics that can be used as independent prognostic factors, we constructed a nomogram that could accurately determine the survival time of each patient. In addition, a lncRNA score was constructed using a principal component analysis algorithm to quantify the DNA methylation-related lncRNA expression patterns of individual tumors.ResultsWe found that a higher lncRNA score indicated a worse the prognosis and was associated with a reduced tumor mutation burden and immunosuppression. A low lncRNA score was related to an increase in neoantigen load and an increase in the anti-PDL1/CTLA4 immunotherapy response. Additionally, a low lncRNA score was related to a significant therapeutic advantage and clinical benefit.ConclusionsThis study describes a DNA methylation regulator-related lncRNA signature model, which provides a new approach for predicting therapeutic response and patient stratification in GC. Assessing lncRNA expression patterns in individual tumors will contribute to enhancing our understanding of tumor microenvironment infiltration and guide more effective immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05234-8.",1
"PurposeWe aimed to assess the predictive value of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) therapy using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted at Seoul National University Hospital. Patients with EGFR/ALK-wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received ICBs between December 2013 and December 2019 were enrolled. Patients with archived blood samples collected prior to ICB treatment were assigned to the ELISA cohort. In addition, those with tissue samples from sites of recurrence or metastasis were assigned to an IHC cohort. Then, we analyzed Gal-3 expression in both cohorts.ResultsFifty-six patients in the ELISA cohort were grouped into low (N = 36) and high (N = 20) groups, using the mean Gal-3 ELISA level (13.24 pg/ml) as a cutoff. The high group demonstrated trends toward reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (0.9 vs. 3.7 months, p = 0.196) and significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (1.6 vs. 12.3 months, p = 0.018) than the low group. We categorized 94 patients in the IHC cohort into negative (N = 31) and positive (N = 63) groups based on Gal-3 IHC positivity. However, the median PFS (4.6 vs. 4.6 months for the negative vs. positive IHC group, respectively, p = 0.345) and OS (16.4 vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.137) were not significantly different.ConclusionHigh blood Gal-3 levels may predict inferior survival in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with ICBs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04275-9.","Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, a novel anti-tumor strategy, can specifically eliminate tumors by activating the immune system and inhibiting tumor immune escape. However, ICI therapy can lead to notable negative outcomes known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). ICI-induced arthritis, also known as ICI arthritis, stands as the prevailing form of irAEs. The purpose of this review is to highlight the crucial functions of T cells in the progression of ICI arthritis. Under the influence of different signaling molecules, T cells could gather in large numbers within the synovial membrane of joints, releasing inflammatory substances and enzymes that harm healthy tissues, ultimately causing ICI arthritis. Moreover, considering the functions of T cells in triggering ICI arthritis, this review suggests several treatments to prevent ICI arthritis, including inhibiting the overstimulation of T cells at the synovial sac of joints, enhancing the precision of ICI medications, and directing ICI drugs specifically towards tumor tissues instead of joints. Collectively, T lymphocytes play a vital role in the onset of ICI arthritis, offering a hopeful perspective on treating ICI arthritis through the specific targeting of T cells within the affected joints.",1
"ABSTRACTBackgroundThis study analyzed the application of dual bronchodilators in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) & chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during the perioperative period.Research design and methodsA total of 100 patients with moderate to severe COPD who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy were divided into two groups. The patients in the observation group (group O) were treated with umeclidinium/vilanterol and conventional treatment (oxygen therapy, assisted expectoration, respiratory rehabilitation training) during the perioperative period. The patients in the control group (group C) received conventional treatment. Lung function, arterial blood gas values, quality of life, postoperative adverse reactions, days of postoperative chest tube placement and hospitalization were assessed.ResultsBefore surgery, group O presented higher FEV1, FVC, PEF and MVV, elevated PO2 and reduced PCO2, lower CAT scores compared with the group C (p < 0.05). The group O demonstrated fewer perioperative adverse reactions, and shorter days of postoperative chest tube and hospitalization compared with the group C (p < 0.05).ConclusionsPerioperative inhalation of umeclidinium/vilanterol can effectively protect arterial blood gas and respiratory function in patients with LC complicated with COPD.","PurposeAs a novel antiangiogenic multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved in China, anlotinib has exhibited promising anticancer efficacy and acceptable safety profile in the salvage treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in clinical trials. Here we retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third- or further-line treatment in patients with refractory SCLC.Patients and methodsA total of 40 patients with refractory SCLC treated with anlotinib monotherapy were included in this study. The clinicopathological data, treatment information, survival data and safety data were retrospectively collected. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed by log-rank testing.ResultsAltogether, 40 patients of extensive-stage SCLC or progressive limited-stage SCLC received anlotinib monotherapy as third- or further-line treatment from July 2018 to June 2020. Four patients achieved partial response (PR), 14 patients achieved stable disease (SD), no complete response (CR) was recorded, and 22 patients experienced progressive disease (PD). The disease control rate (DCR) was 45.0%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.241–3.759), and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.8 months (95% CI 3.190–12.410). The common adverse effects (AEs) included hypertension, fatigue, anorexia, cough, rash and nausea. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 3 (7.5%) patients. One patient interrupted anlotinib treatment due to repeated grade 1 epistaxis. Univariate analysis revealed that patients without liver metastases, previously treated with radiotherapy or with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0 or 1 had longer OS with anlotinib treatment. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients without liver metastases and patients with ECOG score ≤ 1 had longer PFS, while patients without liver metastases had longer OS.ConclusionAnlotinib is beneficial to refractory SCLC as third- or further-line treatment, especially in patients without liver metastasis and with better physical status. Related adverse effects are tolerable and manageable.",0
Herein we recount the legacy of Sir David Roxbee Cox (15 July 1924 – 18 January 2022) from the perspective of practicing clinicians. His pioneering work in developing the logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression models revolutionized the analysis and interpretation of categorical and time-to-event survival outcomes in modern medicine. This legacy is an inspiration for all those who follow on Sir David Cox’s path.,"AbstractBackgroundSarcomatoid carcinomas (SC) are rare tumors with both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, linked to aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Sarcomatoid carcinoma of unknown primary (SCUP) is an exceedingly rare subset with limited literature and no standardized management guidelines. This study aims to characterize the clinical presentations, treatment patterns, and genomic landscape of SCUP.Patients and MethodsData were retrospectively collected from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cancer of Unknown Primary Registry. Patients included had biopsy-proven SC with no identifiable primary tumor despite comprehensive diagnostic evaluations. Baseline characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) results, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Kaplan–Meier survival estimates, and Cox proportional hazards regression.ResultsFifty-two SCUP patients were identified, with a median age of 60 years. Most patients presented with widely metastatic disease, particularly lytic bone lesions. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was noted in nearly half of the patients. IHC showed high positivity for AE1/AE3 and OSCAR antibodies. Tumor NGS revealed 247 alterations, with TP53 being the most common mutation. Patients receiving definitive therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 72 months, significantly longer than those receiving systemic therapy (14 months). Immunotherapy was a significant prognostic factor, reducing the risk of death by 90%.ConclusionsThis study provides essential insights into the clinical and genomic characteristics of SCUP, advocating for the integration of definitive therapy and immunotherapy in treatment protocols. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and improve patient outcomes.",0
"AbstractPathogens can be involved in tumor initiation, promotion, and progression through different mechanisms, and their treatment can prevent new cancer cases, improve outcomes, and revert poor‐prognostic phenotypes. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) successfully treats different types of cancers and infections and, therefore, has a unique potential to address their combination. However, we believe this potential has been underutilized, and few researchers have investigated the impacts of PDT of both infection‐related and cancer‐related outcomes at once. This review presents the main agents behind cancer‐associated infections (CAIs), the PDT protocols that have been tested on them, and their key findings. Additionally, we discuss the key aspects of PDT that make it ideal for CAI treatment, and what knowledge gaps need to be filled in order to make it successful.","Purpose of ReviewAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal blood neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in mitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by novel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluation.Recent FindingsMetabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity to therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial metabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a breakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial complexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting these vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy in preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results limited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on drug combinations with synergistic or additive activity.SummaryIn this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies targeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the specific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to achieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that currently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or are not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells. Thus, further studies of complex metabolic rewiring of leukemia cells before and after combinatorial therapies are warranted.",0
"While anticancer drug discovery has seen dramatic innovations and successes, sequential single therapies are time-limited by resistance, and combinatorial strategies have been lagging. The number of possible drug combinations is vast. To select drug combinations the oncologist requires knowledge of the optimal combination of proteins to co-target. Currently, combinations that the oncologist considers are primarily from empirical observations and clinical praxis. Our aim is to develop a signaling-based method to discover optimal proteins for the oncologist to co-target with drug combinations, and test it on available, patient-derived data. To temper the expected resistance to single drug regimen, we offer a concept-based stratified pipeline aimed at selecting co-targets for drug combinations. Our strategy is unique in its co-target selection being based on signaling pathways. This is significant since in cancer, drug resistance commonly bypasses blocked proteins by wielding alternative, or complementary, routes to execute cell proliferation. Our network-informed signaling-based approach harnesses advanced network concepts and metrics, and our compiled, tissue-specific co-existing mutations. Co-existing driver mutations are common in resistance. Thus, to mimic cancer and counter drug resistance scenarios, our pipeline seeks co-targets that when targeted by drug combinations, can shut off cancer’s modus operandi. That is, its parallel or complementary signaling pathways would be blocked. Rotating through combinations could further lessen emerging resistance. We applied it to patient-derived breast and colorectal ESR1|PIK3CA and BRAF|PIK3CA subnetworks. Consistently, in breast cancer, our results suggest co-targeting proteins from the ESR1|PIK3CA subnetwork with an alpelisib-LJM716 combination. In colorectal cancer, they co-target BRAF|PIK3CA with alpelisib, cetuximab, and encorafenib combination. Collectively, our pipeline’s results are promising, and validated by patient-based xenografts.","BackgroundIn CLEAR, lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (L+P) significantly improved efficacy versus sunitinib in first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We report results from CLEAR biomarker analyses.MethodsPD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing assays (whole exome sequencing/RNA-sequencing) were performed on archival tumor specimens.For IHC-derived/RNA-sequencing analyses, a continuous analysis was performed adjusting by Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score for: PD-L1 CPS versus best overall response (BOR)/PFS; and each gene-signature score (T-cell inflamed gene-expression profile [TcellinfGEP]/non-TcellinfGEP signatures including proliferation and angiogenesis) versus BOR/PFS.Association between mutation status of RCC driver genes and PFS were analyzed for genes for which ≥20 patients per arm had oncogenic alterations. Association of molecular subtypes with outcome was evaluated with baseline KPS adjustments. The set of biomarkers evaluated and statistical significance criteria for PD-L1 CPS, gene signature scores, and molecular subtypes were pre-specified.ResultsWithin-arm analyses using continuous values showed no association between PD-L1 levels and BOR/PFS for either treatment.PFS hazard ratios between arms were similar regardless of mutant or wildtype subgroups of RCC driver genes (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, KDM5C).No associations between PFS and gene-signature scores were observed for L+P. With sunitinib, high proliferation and MYC signature scores showed shorter PFS; high angiogenesis and microvessel density signature scores showed longer PFS.Six new molecular subtypes were defined. Tumors of patients with favorable/intermediate risk were enriched in angiogenesis and angiogenesis/stromal clusters; those with poor risk were enriched in proliferative and unclassified (low-TcellinfGEP/low-angiogenesis/low-proliferation) clusters. No association between molecular subtypes and PFS for L+P/sunitinib was observed (after adjustment for KPS and gene signatures that were individually associated with PFS).ConclusionsImprovements in ORR and PFS for L+P versus sunitinib in aRCC were observed consistently across a range of biomarker subgroups defined using RCC driver mutations, PD-L1, gene expression signatures, and molecular subtypes.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become an indispensable part of clinical practice; however, off-label use of these agents is unknown. We aimed to define the patterns of off-label use of ICIs in a nationwide sample of patients.MethodsThe online database (Reçetem) was retrospectively searched for off-label use cases related to ICIs approved during a 6-month period. Adult patients with metastatic solid tumors were included. Ethics approval was obtained. Reasons for off-label use were recorded in eight categories and cases were assessed for adherence to current guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed with GNU PSPP version 1.5.3.ResultsFive hundred seventy-seven reasons for use were recorded for 538 cases related to 527 patients (67.5% male). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (35.9%) was the most common cancer type. Nivolumab (49%), pembrolizumab (25.5%), and atezolizumab (25%) were commonly used. The top reason for off-label use was lack of approval for the cancer type (37.1%), followed by use beyond the approved treatment line (21%). Nivolumab was more frequently used than atezolizumab and/or pembrolizumab in patients with malignant melanoma, kidney cancer, head and neck cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, p < 0.001). The guideline adherence rate was 60.5%.ConclusionOff-label use of ICIs was primarily related to (NSCLC), and most patients were treatment-naïve in contrast to the acceptance that off-label use results from exhausted treatment options. Lack of approval is a significant reason for the off-label use of ICIs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04803-1.","Purpose:In patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), ATM and BRCA2 mutations dictate differences in PARPi inhibitor response and other therapies. We interrogated the molecular features of ATM- and BRCA2-mutated mPC to explain the divergent clinical outcomes and inform future treatment decisions.Experimental Design:We examined a novel set of 1,187 mPCs after excluding microsatellite-instable (MSI) tumors. We stratified these based on ATM (n = 88) or BRCA2 (n = 98) mutations. As control groups, mPCs with mutations in 12 other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes were considered non-BRCA2/ATM HRR-deficient (HRDother, n = 193), whereas lack of any HRR mutations were considered HRR-proficient (HRP; n = 808). Gene expression analyses were performed using Limma. Real-world overall survival was determined from insurance claims data.Results:In noncastrate mPCs, only BRCA2-mutated mPCs exhibited worse clinical outcomes to AR-targeted therapies. In castrate mPCs, both ATM and BRCA2 mutations exhibited worse clinical outcomes to AR-targeted therapies. ATM-mutated mPCs had reduced TP53 mutations and harbored coamplification of 11q13 genes, including CCND1 and genes in the FGF family. BRCA2-mutated tumors showed elevated genomic loss-of-heterozygosity scores and were often tumor mutational burden high. BRCA2-mutated mPCs had upregulation of cell-cycle genes and were enriched in cell-cycle signaling programs. This was distinct from ATM-mutated tumors.Conclusions:Tumoral ATM and BRCA2 mutations are associated with differential clinical outcomes when patients are stratified by treatments, including hormonal or taxane therapies. ATM- and BRCA2-mutated tumors exhibited differences in co-occurring molecular features. These unique molecular features may inform therapeutic decisions and development of novel therapies.",0
"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to investigate and analyze the level of actual participation and perceived importance of shared decision-making on treatment and care of lung cancer patients, to compare their differences and to explore their influencing factors.MethodsA total of 290 lung cancer patients were collected from oncology and thoracic surgery departments of a comprehensive medical center in Qingdao from October 2018 to December 2019. Participants completed a cross-sectional questionnaire to assess their actual participation and perceived importance in shared decision-making on treatment and care. Descriptive analysis and non-parametric tests were carried out to assess the status quo of patients' shared decision-making on treatment and care. Binary logistic regression analysis with a stepwise back-wards was applied to predict factors that affected patients' participation in shared decision-making.ResultsThe results showed that patients with lung cancer had a low degree of participation in shared decision-making. There were significant differences between actual participation and perceived importance of shared decision-making on treatment and care. Education level, age, gender, income, marital status, personality, the course of the disease (> 6 months), and the pathological TNM staging (III) affected patient's level of participation in shared decision-making.ConclusionActual participation in shared decision-making on the treatment and care of lung cancer patients was low and considered unimportant. We could train oncology nurses to use patient decision aids to help patients and families participate in shared decision-making on patients’ value, preferences and needs.","Background:Prognosis for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL) is guarded despite aggressive therapy, and few studies have characterized outcomes after radiotherapy in relation to radiation treatment fields.Methods:Multi-institutional retrospective cohort of 293 patients with HR-NBL who received autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and EBRT between 1997–2021. LRR was defined as recurrence at the primary site or within one nodal echelon beyond disease present at diagnosis. Follow-up was defined from the end of EBRT. Event-free survival (EFS) and OS were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative incidence of locoregional progression (CILP) was analyzed using competing risks of distant-only relapse and death with Gray’s test.Results:Median follow-up was 7.0 years (range: 0.01–22.4). Five-year CILP, EFS, and OS were 11.9%, 65.2%, and 77.5%, respectively. Of the 31 patients with LRR and imaging review, 15 (48.4%) had in-field recurrences (>12 Gy), 6 (19.4%) had marginal failures (≤12 Gy), and 10 (32.3%) had both in-field and marginal recurrences. No patients receiving total body irradiation (12 Gy) experienced marginal-only failures (p=0.069). On multivariable analyses, MYCN amplification had higher risk of LRR (HR: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.06–5.50, p=0.035) and post-consolidation isotretinoin and anti-GD2 antibody therapy (HR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.19–0.94, p=0.035) had lower risk of LRR.Conclusions:Despite EBRT, LRR remains a contributor to treatment failure in HR-NBL with approximately half of LRRs including a component of marginal failure. Future prospective studies are needed to explore whether radiation fields and doses should be defined based on molecular features such as MYCN amplification, and/or response to chemotherapy.",0
ABSTRACTLatest developments in the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine compiled from publicly available information and press releases from non-academic institutions in July 2024.,"PurposeTo develop and validate a nomogram for predicting survival in intermediate- and high-risk neuroblastoma patients and to compare the accuracy of the nomogram in predicting survival with Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk stratification.MethodsA total of 885 intermediate- and high-risk neuroblastoma patients were enrolled in this study, including 243 patients from our hospital (the training set) and 642 patients from the TARGET database (the validation set). The factors related to event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in neuroblastoma were determined to construct the nomogram by Cox regression analysis. The C-index, calibration curves, and area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were used to assess the predictive performance of the nomogram.ResultsInternational Neuroblastoma Staging System stage and Mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI) were significant unfavorable factors for EFS, while MKI and MYCN status were significant unfavorable factors for OS. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.621 and 0.586 for predicting EFS, 0.650 and 0.570 for predicting OS in the training and validation sets, respectively. The calibration curves revealed good agreement in the EFS and OS predicted by the nomogram. The AUCs of the nomogram for 1-, 2-, 3-year EFS and OS were 0.633, 0.669, 0.604 and 0.672, 0.670, 0.702 in the training set, respectively. Moreover, the nomogram was able to classify patients into two groups according to risk scores, with the “high-risk” group having a lower survival rate than the “intermediate-risk” group. And the nomogram performed better than the COG risk stratification, which had a C-index of 0.537, 0.502 and 0.565, 0.572 for predicting EFS, OS in the training and validation sets, respectively.ConclusionWe developed and validated a prognostic nomogram for intermediate- and high-risk neuroblastoma patients that clinicians can use to make more informed decisions for individual patients.",0
"BackgroundThe CD-TK double suicide gene has become an effective therapy for bladder cancer. A novel molecular-targeted ultrasound (US) method has been developed to precisely guide nanobubbles loaded with this gene to regions within bladder tumor cells and is widely used due to its efficiency in delivering drugs to the target tumor.MethodsUniform nanoscaled nanobubbles loaded with CD-TK double suicide gene were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods.ResultsIn the present study, we synthesized CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded cationic nanobubbles conjugated with anti-VEGFR2 that can bind with VEGFR2-positive cells. Fluorescence and flow cytometry evidence show that CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded nanobubbles were successfully developed. CD-TK-CNBs delivered via US-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) enhanced transfection efficiency, overexpression of CD-TK double suicide gene, and tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro.ConclusionsThese CD-TK-CNBs may become a novel treatment for bladder cancer.","BackgroundOvarian cancer (OvCa) is the most lethal of the gynecologic malignancies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have revolutionized the treatment of multiple malignancies, have had limited efficacy in OvCa patients. This lack of effectiveness is partly due to the abnormal ovarian tumor microenvironment (TME), displaying a desmoplastic, highly fibrotic extracellular matrix. High extracellular matrix deposition leads to a buildup of compressive forces that cause tumor blood vessel collapse, reduced vessel perfusion, poor delivery of drugs, and compromised trafficking of cytotoxic T-cells to these tumors.MethodsUsing two syngeneic OvCa models, we tested the effect of losartan, a widely prescribed anti-hypertensive drug, on reprogramming the TME and chemosensitizing the cancer cells.ResultsLosartan treatment (i) reprograms the TME leading to increased vascular perfusion, and thus enhances drug delivery and immune effector cell intratumoral infiltration and function; and (ii) rewires the OvCa cells by suppressing the IGF-1 signaling, resulting in enhanced chemosensitivity. As a result of the combined tumor and stromal effects, losartan treatment enhances the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in OvCa models.ConclusionThe safety and low cost ( < $1-2/day) of losartan warrant rapid translation of our findings to patients with OvCa.",0
"BackgroundCopper homeostasis imbalance has been implicated in tumor progression, aggressiveness, and treatment response. However, the precise roles of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood.MethodsIn this study, we employed a consensus clustering algorithm to identify distinct molecular subtypes. We then performed Kaplan–Meier analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis to identify prognostic differentially expressed genes. The expression of these genes was subsequently validated using qPCR on fresh-frozen tissues obtained from HCC patients. Moreover, leveraging the TCGA-HCC cohort, we constructed a CRGs-related risk prediction model using the LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analysis.ResultsBy analyzing the data, we successfully established a CRGs risk prognostic model for HCC patients, comprising five differential genes (CAD, SGCB, TXNRD1, KDR, and MTND4P20). Cox regression analysis revealed that the CRGs risk score could serve as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.308, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.200 − 1.426, P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) values of the CRGs-score for predicting 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 0.785, 0.724, and 0.723, respectively. Notably, the expression levels of immune checkpoints (including PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4) significantly differed between the low- and high-risk score groups. Furthermore, the low-risk score group displayed increased sensitivity to sorafenib, cisplatin, cyclopamine, nilotinib, salubrinal, and gemcitabine, whereas the high-risk score group exhibited heightened sensitivity to lapatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the potential of the CRGs risk score as an independent and promising biomarker for clinical prognosis and immunotherapy sensitivity in HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05099-x.","ObjectiveTo search for human protein-coding genes related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and perform prognosis risk assessment.MethodsGenes related to HBV-HCC were selected through literature screening and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network database analysis. Prognosis potential genes (PPGs) were identified using Cox regression analysis. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on PPGs, and risk scores were calculated. Kaplan–Meier plots were used to analyze overall survival rates, and the results were predicted based on clinicopathological variables. Association analysis was also conducted with immune infiltration, immune therapy, and drug sensitivity. Experimental verification of the expression of PPGs was done in patient liver cancer tissue and normal liver tissue adjacent to tumors.ResultsThe use of a prognosis potential genes risk assessment model can reliably predict the prognosis risk of patients, demonstrating strong predictive ability. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the overall survival rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than that of the high-risk group. There were significant differences between the two subgroups in terms of immune infiltration and IC50 association analysis. Experimental verification revealed that CYP2C19, FLNC, and HNRNPC were highly expressed in liver cancer tissue, while UBE3A was expressed at a lower level.ConclusionPPGs can be used to predict the prognosis risk of HBV-HCC patients and play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. They also reveal their potential role in the tumor immune microenvironment, clinical-pathological characteristics, and prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04989-4.",1
This case report highlights a rare case of renal cell carcinoma metastasis to nose and paranasal sinuses in a 55-year-old male 8 years post-nephrectomy. Contrast imaging revealed a vascular mass and histopathology confirmed metastatic RCC. Partial maxillectomy was done and patient remained disease free at 6 month follow up.,"ABSTRACTTreatment of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) has evolved over the last decade. According to studies, the use of targeted therapies has significantly increased the life expectancy of patients. Moreover, ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have improved clinical outcomes.

The experts agreed that these recommendations should be part of a healthcare strategy to be implemented at the national level.",0
"AbstractIntroductionNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with large brain metastases (BrM) defined as >2 cm in diameter historically face grim prognoses. With immunotherapy emerging as a promising avenue for BrM management and being commonly used in NSCLC, its application in addressing large BrM remains underexplored.MethodsThis retrospective study conducted across the MedStar Georgetown Cancer Network aimed to assess the efficacy of immunotherapy in non-biomarker driven NSCLC patients with large BrM following initial treatment.ResultsThirty-six patients were included, all of whom underwent neurosurgery and/or radiation before commencing immunotherapy. The median intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.2 months and the median overall survival (OS) reached 31 months. Utilizing multivariable Cox penalized regression, the intracranial PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02-0.26) for patients who received at least 90 days of immunotherapy compared to those who did not. Each additional 30 days of immunotherapy was associated with an OS HR 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67-0.90).ConclusionThis real-world data highlights the potential of immunotherapy in large BrM NSCLC patients, a population often excluded from clinical trials. This study contributes insights that can inform future treatment approaches, emphasizing the need for further exploration of immunotherapy’s role in enhancing outcomes for this challenging patient population.","AbstractBackground and AimsOver the last decade, treatment options for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) have expanded. However, comparative studies between these agents are limited, especially among biologic-naive patients. We aimed to compare the persistence, effectiveness, and safety of tofacitinib and vedolizumab as the first advanced treatment for patients with UC.MethodsPatients who received either tofacitinib or vedolizumab as their first advanced therapy for UC in NHS Lothian were included. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting. The probability of treatment assignment was calculated via logistic regression using age, sex, UC duration, Montreal extent, C-reactive protein, concomitant corticosteroids, and partial Mayo score at drug commencement.ResultsWe included n = 158 patients, of whom n = 81 (51.3%) received vedolizumab and n = 77 (48.7%) tofacitinib. Median follow-up for vedolizumab patients was 3.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.6-4.8) and for tofacitinib patients 1.5 years (IQR 0.3-2.3). The cohort was 59.5% male with a median age of 41.1 years (IQR 31.5-51.8). At 2 years, vedolizumab persistence was superior to tofacitinib (p = 0.005). At Weeks 12 and 52, clinical, biochemical, and fecal biomarker steroid-free remission were comparable between groups. Primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response were 9.9% and 17.3% for vedolizumab and 23.4% and 13% for tofacitinib, respectively. The frequency of adverse events was comparable (11 [13.6%] vedolizumab vs 19 [24.7%] tofacitinib, p = 0.629).ConclusionsWe found that the persistence and tolerability of vedolizumab were superior to tofacitinib in bio-naive UC, although the rates of clinical and biomarker remission were comparable. These data may help inform the positioning of advanced therapy.",1
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that is capturing popular imagination and can revolutionize biomedicine. AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to break through existing barriers in oncology research and practice such as automating workflow processes, personalizing care, and reducing healthcare disparities. Emerging applications of AI/ML in the literature include screening and early detection of cancer, disease diagnosis, response prediction, prognosis, and accelerated drug discovery. Despite this excitement, only few AI/ML models have been properly validated and fewer have become regulated products for routine clinical use. In this review, we highlight the main challenges impeding AI/ML clinical translation. We present different clinical use cases from the domains of radiology, radiation oncology, immunotherapy, and drug discovery in oncology. We dissect the unique challenges and opportunities associated with each of these cases. Finally, we summarize the general requirements for successful AI/ML implementation in the clinic, highlighting specific examples and points of emphasis including the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration of stakeholders, role of domain experts in AI augmentation, transparency of AI/ML models, and the establishment of a comprehensive quality assurance program to mitigate risks of training bias and data drifts, all culminating toward safer and more beneficial AI/ML applications in oncology labs and clinics.","AbstractPatients with brain tumors are often admitted to the hospital at critical stages of their disease course: initial diagnosis, relapse, end-of-life, and for management of serious complications. Patients who develop neurologic complications from systemic cancers and their treatments also frequently require management in the hospital setting. Most neuro-oncologists have busy outpatient practices and limited inpatient responsibilities. Their experience with hospital workflows, bandwidth to see inpatients, and comfort level managing certain diagnoses such as immunotherapy neurotoxicities may be variable, even within a single institution. Recent literature supports the beneficial role of the Oncology Hospitalist, a physician who specializes in the care of hospitalized patients with cancer. Oncology Hospitalist care improves length of stay, cost effectiveness, and the patient and oncologist experience. To our knowledge, the role of a hospitalist who specializes in the care of patients with neuro-oncologic issues has not yet been investigated. Here we describe the responsibilities and examine the impact of a Neuro-Oncology Hospitalist at a single institution over a 2-year period, with a focus on metrics of quality and efficiency of care. Patients and cancer care systems benefit from the dedicated inpatient presence of a neuro-oncologist, supporting the development of a Neuro-Oncology Hospitalist model.",0
"Actionable mutations of RET kinase have been identified as oncogenic drivers of solid tumors, including thyroid cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and nonsmall cell lung cancer. Although multikinase inhibitors and RET selective inhibitors are used to treat patients with RET alterations, there is insufficient research addressing certain issues: which actionable mutations arise from these therapies, how to improve the clinical response rate to RET inhibitors, and how to design new inhibitors to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, the development of sophisticated tool compounds is required to investigate the molecular mechanisms of actionable mutations and to develop breakthrough therapeutics for different RET alterations. Herein, we present our investigation into the side chains of imidazopyridazine hinge binders that are capable of inducing protein–ligand interaction patterns from the gatekeeper to the waterfront regions. Extending the substituents at the second and sixth positions enhanced the IC50 up to < 0.5 nM for diverse RET alterations.","AbstractBackgroundMany patients with cancer use cannabis to help alleviate untreated cancer symptoms and side effects.MethodsWe examined associations of perceived benefits and risks and postdiagnosis cannabis use in a weighted sample of adult cancer survivors through a 1-time survey. Fifteen perceived cannabis use benefits and 19 perceived risks were operationalized as both summary scores and report of any benefits or risks. Survey-weighted logistic regression provided covariate-adjusted odds of postdiagnosis cannabis use for each benefit-risk measure.ResultsAmong the weighted population of 3785 survivors (mean [SD] age = 62.2 [13.5] years), one-third used cannabis after diagnosis. Perceiving any benefits increased the odds of postdiagnosis cannabis use more than 500%, and perceiving any risks lowered the odds by 59%. Each SD increase in endorsed benefits doubled the odds of postdiagnosis cannabis use, while each SD increase in endorsed risks reduced the odds by 36%.ConclusionAn accurate understanding of benefits and risks is critical for informed decision making.",0
"Background:Axitinib plus pembrolizumab showed superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) versus sunitinib in a randomised phase III trial in patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). We report long-term efficacy and safety of the axitinib/pembrolizumab from the phase I trial (NCT02133742), after 46–55 months from study initiation (data cut-off date, 23rd July 2019).Methods:Fifty-two treatment-naïve patients with advanced RCC were treated with oral axitinib 5 mg twice daily and intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. PFS, duration of response (DoR) and OS were summarised using the Kaplan–Meier method.Results:At a median follow-up of 42.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.1–44.1), median OS was not reached; 38 (73.1%) patients were alive. The probability of being alive at 4 years was 66.8% (95% CI: 49.1–79.5). Median PFS in the overall population was 23.5 months (95% CI: 15.4–30.4). ORR was 73.1%; five patients had complete response. Median DoR was 22.1 months (95% CI: 15.1–34.5). Grade III/IV adverse events (AEs) were reported in 38 (73.1%) patients and 20 (38.5%) discontinued treatment because of AEs: 17 (32.7%) discontinued axitinib, 13 (25.0%) discontinued pembrolizumab, and 10 (19.2%) discontinued both drugs. Common AEs included diarrhoea (84.6%), fatigue (80.8%), hypertension (53.8%), cough (48.1%) and dysphonia (48.1%). There were no new AE terms reported and no treatment-related deaths.Conclusions:In patients with advanced RCC with ~4 years of follow-up, combination axitinib/pembrolizumab continued to demonstrate clinical benefit, with no new safety signals.","AbstractIntroductionThe phase 3 LEAP-002 study (NCT03713593) of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggested improved antitumor activity of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus lenvatinib alone with manageable safety, although overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) did not reach prespecified statistical significance. This post hoc analysis assessed efficacy and safety in Japanese patients.MethodsPatients with advanced HCC without prior systemic treatment were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 8 mg (body weight <60 kg) or 12 mg (body weight ≥60 kg) oral lenvatinib once daily plus 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Dual primary end points were OS and PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary end points were objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and time to progression per RECIST v1.1 by BICR and safety.ResultsOverall, 80 patients were enrolled in Japan (lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, n = 39; lenvatinib plus placebo, n = 41). Median time from randomization to database cutoff (June 21, 2022) was 34.1 months (range: 26.9–39.6). Median OS was 31.4 months (95% CI: 21.2– not reached) for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 21.4 months (95% CI: 14.4–25.4) for lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [95% CI: 0.31–0.96]). Median PFS for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was 10.4 months (95% CI: 6.2–18.5) and 6.5 months (95% CI: 6.0–8.3) for lenvatinib plus placebo (HR = 0.54 [95% CI: 0.32–0.90]). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 26 patients (67%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 24 patients (59%) in the lenvatinib plus placebo group.ConclusionIn Japanese patients enrolled in LEAP-002, findings were consistent with the global population where OS and PFS trended toward improvement; a similar safety profile was observed.",1
"ABSTRACTCholesterol serves as a vital lipid that regulates numerous physiological processes. Nonetheless, its role in regulating cell death processes remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of cholesterol trafficking in immunogenic cell death. Through cell-based drug screening, we identified two antidepressants, sertraline and indatraline, as potent inducers of the nuclear translocation of TFEB (transcription factor EB). Activation of TFEB was mediated through the autophagy-independent lipidation of MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3). Both compounds promoted cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes, resulting in lysosomal membrane permeabilization, disruption of autophagy and cell death that could be reversed by cholesterol depletion. Molecular docking analysis indicated that sertraline and indatraline have the potential to inhibit cholesterol binding to the lysosomal cholesterol transporters, NPC1 (NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1) and NPC2. This inhibitory effect might be further enhanced by the upregulation of NPC1 and NPC2 expression by TFEB. Both antidepressants also upregulated PLA2G15 (phospholipase A2 group XV), an enzyme that elevates lysosomal cholesterol. In cancer cells, sertraline and indatraline elicited immunogenic cell death, converting dying cells into prophylactic vaccines that were able to confer protection against tumor growth in mice. In a therapeutic setting, a single dose of each compound was sufficient to significantly reduce the outgrowth of established tumors in a T-cell-dependent manner. These results identify sertraline and indatraline as immunostimulatory agents for cancer treatment. More generally, this research shed light on novel therapeutic avenues harnessing lysosomal cholesterol transport to regulate immunogenic cell death.Abbreviation: ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG13: autophagy related 13; DKO: double knockout; ICD: immunogenic cell death; KO: knockout; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; LGALS3: galectin 3; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; LMP: lysosomal membrane permeabilization; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MTX: mitoxantrone; NPC1: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1; NPC2: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2; TFE3: transcription factor E3; TFEB: transcription factor EB; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), resulting in poor clinical outcomes and high mortality. The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Punicalagin (PCG), a polyphenol obtained from the Punica granatum, against TNBC. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of PCG in TNBC (MDA-MB-231, BT-20) and ER + (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. A dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was observed with PCG (12.5–100 μM). However, only 50 and 100 μM doses of PCG inhibited the growth of BT-20 and MCF-7 cells. PCG significantly increased mitochondrial ROS in TNBC cells and induced autophagy across all cell lines, as evidenced by an increase in autophagic vacuoles and a decrease in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. PCG suppressed PI3K/Akt and activated phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) signaling. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that PCG is capable of significantly inhibiting the proliferation of TNBC cells through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway as well as the initiation of the JNK pathway. PCG could thus be potentially useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of TNBC.Graphical abstract",1
"PurposeOur study intended to explore the correlation between HER2 alterations and 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and their prognostic value in EGFR-negative non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS).MethodsNGS assay was performed in 1737 NSCLC patients, a total of 88 HER2 alterations and 176 negative HER2 with EGFR-negative patients were randomly selected for this study.ResultsWhen the HER2 status with EGFR-negative group was analyzed, multivariate analysis showed that smoking status, primary tumor SUVmax (pSUVmax) < 13.03 and stage were the independent deterministic factors of HER2 alterations. Multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that HER2 status, age, smoking status and stage were independent risk factors for overall survival (OS) in EGFR-negative NSCLC patients with different HER2 status. When the HER2 alterations group was separately analyzed, multivariate analysis demonstrated that low pSUVmax < 15.32 and histology were the independent deterministic factors of HER2 mutation. Multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that pSUVmax, smoking status, nodal involvement and treatment methods were independent risk factors for OS in EGFR-negative NSCLC patients with HER2 alterations.ConclusionThe study revealed that low pSUVmax was associated with HER2 alterations in EGFR-negative NSCLC patients, moreover HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification exhibited distinct 18F-FDG metabolic and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, it explored the prognostic value of HER2 alterations and 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters of pSUVmax in EGFR-negative NSCLC patients.","BackgroundCombination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chemotherapy (ICI + chemotherapy) has become the standard first line treatment for driver oncogene-negative advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it may be more toxic compared to monotherapy, which limits its use. Moreover, the feasibility of the combination therapy in clinical practice remains unknown.MethodsWe conducted a cohort study to determine the implementation rate of ICI + chemotherapy in clinical practice. We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from advanced NSCLC patients who received systemic therapy at 13 institutions between December 2018 and December 2020.ResultsAfter excluding 154 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene alterations, a total of 919 NSCLC patients were included. Among them, 442 were treated with ICI + chemotherapy (48%), whereas 477 were treated with other therapies (52%). Among these 477 patients, 340 did not receive ICI + chemotherapy because of intolerance (71%); thus, more than one-third of the advanced NSCLC patients do not benefit from the combination therapy due to intolerance. Among the 659 NSCLC patients for whom PD-L1 was < 50% or unknown, only 342 received the ICI + chemotherapy combination (52%) even though it is considered preferable to either therapy alone; the remaining 318 patients were treated with other therapies (48%). Among the 318 patients who did not receive ICI + chemotherapy, 274 were intolerant to it (86%).ConclusionOur results revealed that a substantial proportion of advanced NSCLC patients did not benefit from ICI + chemotherapy due to intolerance. As treatments for NSCLC are moving toward combinations for greater efficacy, their feasibility in clinical practice must be taken into consideration.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04415-1.",1
"BackgroundUrothelial adenocarcinoma (UA) is a rare subtype of primary urothelial carcinoma, which is more common in women and has a poor prognosis. Because of their low incidence, most of the existing literature is based on case reports and there is a lack of comprehensive literature on this type of tumor.PurposeThis article provides a comprehensive and systematic review of the epidemiology, pathological types, treatment, and prognosis of UA. Especially in the treatment section, we reviewed the various treatment methods including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. This review aims to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical diagnosis and management of UA.MethodsWe reviewed the relevant literature of UA from Pubmed.ConclusionThere is no standard treatment for UA. Multidisciplinary therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, is the current trend. Immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapy will also become viable options for the treatment of UA in future.","AbstractBACKGROUNDThe paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are an uncommon phenomenon with diverse clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of PNS is often challenging because of the broad range of clinical manifestations and the difficulties in the detection of antibodies (AB) that are confirmatory for the diagnosis. Recently published Updated Diagnostic Criteria for PNS improved the efficacy and accuracy of clinical practice but leaves a “gray zone”. The utilization of immunotherapy is rapidly expanding, but the safety and the efficacy of the immunotherapy in PNS patients are unclear as well. Managing PNS is challenging, as there is no consensus on the type of immunomodulatory therapy and the indications for advanced treatment lines. MATERIAL AND METHODSWe retrospectively evaluated the data about the case of PNS treated in the neurology department and Neuro-oncology unit at Sheba MC Israel. RESULTS68 years old male was hospitalized at July 2022 with C7-T3 myelopathy syndrome. The evaluation was negative excluding protein 75 mg/dl and mild pleocytosis, but negative cytology. There was clinical improvement after Methylprednisolon treatment. At March 2023 the patient admitted with acute onset of Lt. hemiparesis and Lt. hemihypoesthesia that developed three weeks after COVID-19 infection. PNS panels of high-risk and low-risk AB in serum and CSF were negative. The Brain MRI showed Rt. thalamic and internal capsule lesion that was hyperintense in FLAIR sequence and homogeneously enhanced by contrast in T1 sequence. The lesion was diagnosed as TUMEFACTIVE demyelinating lesion. Transient clinical and radiological response on steroids treatment was reached. The systemic evaluation revealed the Rt. axillary mass that was diagnosed as BRAF V600E mutated melanoma and case was diagnose as probable PNS. The treatment by BRAF and MEK inhibitors was started and sustained clinical and radiological neurological improvement and oncological complete response were reached.CONCLUSIONMany questions arise while making therapeutic decisions that relate to PNS. One of those is the question of if cancer therapy alone is sufficient and if it is possible to skip the advanced immunomodulatory treatment lines, because immunosuppression constitutes an aggravating prognostic factor for oncological outcome. New targeted oncological therapies have a short time to response which makes this therapeutic approach possible and our case illustrates the concept.",0
"AbstractBackgroundPediatric nail disorders encompass a broad range of conditions. This article aimed to consolidate current knowledge on pediatric nail disorders to enhance diagnostic proficiency and clinical management among healthcare professionals.SummaryPediatric nail disorders present a diagnostic challenge due to their diverse nature. Non-syndromic congenital nail disorders encompass various anomalies such as anonychia/hyponychia, congenital malalignment of the great toenail, and racket thumbs, each with distinct clinical presentations and genetic associations. Syndromic congenital nail disorders, often part of complex syndromes, are characterized by unique features and associated abnormalities. Acquired nail diseases in children, like Beau’s lines and onychomadesis, typically result from trauma or infection, while melanonychia, although rare in children, requires careful monitoring for potential malignant alterations, with consideration for biopsy in cases with concerning features.Key Messages Pediatric nail disorders may pose diagnostic challenges and require a comprehensive understanding of nail anatomy and development.  Congenital nail disorders encompass isolated anomalies and syndromic associations, necessitating thorough evaluation for associated systemic conditions.  Acquired nail diseases may indicate underlying trauma or systemic illness and require careful assessment. Melanonychia in children requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation, emphasizing the importance of consistent follow-up and histopathological examination when necessary.","Aim: Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx (COCO) often exhibit signs of immunosuppression, affecting their prognosis. Understanding the dynamics of humoral immunity in these patients during chemoradiation therapy is crucial for developing effective treatments.Materials & methods: This prospective study included 105 COCO patients undergoing different treatment regimens, with or without alpha/beta-defensins therapy. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, IgA and salivary sIgA were analyzed. Patients were divided into five groups based on treatment protocols.Results & conclusion: Treatment variations impacted serum immunoglobulin levels, notably in Group III, whose patients received radiation treatment and immunotherapy with higher alpha/beta-defensins doses. Significant IgG changes correlated with oral mucositis risk and outcomes. Further trials are necessary for validation and clinical application.",0
"PurposeApatinib, an antiangiogenic drug, has shown beneficial effects only in a fraction of advanced gastric cancer (GC) patients. Given the recent success of immunotherapies, combination of apatinib with immune checkpoint inhibitor may provide sustained and potent antitumor responses.MethodsImmunocompetent mice with subcutaneous MFC tumors grown were given a combination of apatinib and anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy. GC tissues from patients undergoing curative resection in China were collected, and the density of HEVs, MSI status and tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining.ResultsCombined apatinib and PD-L1 blockade therapy synergistically delayed tumor growth and increased survival in MFC-bearing immunocompetent mice. The combination therapy promoted antitumor immunity by increasing the ratio of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells to Foxp3+ Treg cells, the accumulation of CD20+ B cells and the Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio (IFN-γ/IL-10). The combination therapy induced the formation of HEVs through activation of LTβR signaling, thus promoting CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and CD20+ B cell infiltration in tumors. In clinical GC samples, the density of HEVs positively correlated with the intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and CD20+ B cells. MSI-high GC showed a higher density of HEVs, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and CD20+ B cells than MSS/MSI-low GC. GC patients with high densities of HEVs, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and CD20+ B cells had an improved prognosis with superior overall survival.ConclusionCombining apatinib with PD-L1 blockade treatment synergistically enhances antitumor immune responses and promotes HEV formation in GC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03633-3.","PurposeLymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) has previously been used as a prognostic predictor in various solid tumors. This research aims in comparing the prognostic predictive Please check and conability of several inflammatory parameters and clinical parameters to validate further the excellent prognostic value of LMR in patients with gastric cancer treated with apatinib.MethodsMonitor inflammatory, nutritional parameters and tumor markers. Cutoff values of the parameters concerned were identified with the X-tile program. Subgroup analysis was made via Kaplan–Meier curves, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to find independent prognostic factors. The nomogram of logistic regression models was constructed according to the results.ResultsA total of 192 patients (115 divided into training group and 77 into validation group) who received the second- or later-line regimen of apatinib were retrospectively analyzed. The optimal cutoff value for LMR was 1.33. Patients with high LMR (LMR-H) were significantly longer than those with low LMR (LMR-L) in progression-free survival (median 121.0 days vs. median 44.5 days, P < 0.001). The predictive value of LMR was generally uniform across subgroups. Meanwhile, LMR and CA19-9 were the only hematological parameters with significant prognostic value in multivariate analysis. The area under the LMR curve (0.60) was greatest for all inflammatory indices. Adding LMR to the base model significantly enhanced the predictive power of the 6-month probability of disease progression (PD). The LMR-based nomogram showed good predictive power and discrimination in external validation.ConclusionLMR is a simple but effective predictor of prognosis for patients treated with apatinib.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04976-9.",1
"AbstractGenome editing is a technology to make specific changes in the DNA of a cell or an organism. It has significantly altered the landscape of life sciences, facilitating the establishment of exceedingly customized genetic modifications. Among various genome editing technologies, the CRISPR/Cas9 system, a specific endonuclease induces a double stranded DNA break and enabling modifications to the genome, has surfaced as a formidable and adaptable instrument. Its significance cannot be overstated, as it not only allows for the manipulation of genomes in model organisms but also holds great potential for revolutionary advances in medicine, particularly in treating genetic diseases. This review paper explores the remarkable journey of CRISPR/Cas9, its natural function, mechanisms, and transformative impact on genome editing and finally the use of artificial intelligence and other intelligent manufacturing tools used. The introduction provides the background on genome editing, emphasizing the emergence and significance of CRISPR/Cas9. Subsequent sections comprehensively elucidate its natural function, disease modeling, agriculture, and biotechnology, address therapeutic applications, and ongoing clinical trials while also discussing prospects and ethical implications. We summarized the key findings, indicating that CRISPR/Cas9 has empowered the creation of disease-specific animal models. This provides invaluable insights into pathogenic mechanisms and opens new avenues for drug discovery, reaffirming the transformative impact of CRISPR/Cas9 on genome editing. Finally we discussed the importance of continued research and collaboration for comprehensive utilization of the inherent capabilities of this molecular precision tool in shaping forthcoming advancements.","BackgroundThe choice between immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) and chemo-/immunotherapy (CIT) in patients with NSCLC stage IV is often discussed. There are some data that the effect of CPI therapy is impaired by antimicrobial therapy (AMT). Little is known about the influence of AMT on CIT.Patients and methodsWe retrospectively analysed 114 patients (age 68 ± 8.5 years) with NSCLC stage IV. Patients were treated according to the guidelines with either CPI alone (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, cemiplimab) or CIT (Carboplatin/Pemetrexed/Pembrolizumab, Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Pembrolizumab). We registered patients’ characteristics including presence and timing of AMT. Group 1 consisted of 42 patients with AMT in the month before CPI or CIT, group 2 were 49 patients with AMT during CPI or CIT, and group 3 were 64 patients without AMT and CPI or CIT.ResultsGroup 1–3 showed comparable patients characteristics. Using cox-regression analysis, we found that AMT in the month before CPI resulted in a decreased progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients with CPI and no AMT (14 ± 1.02 vs. 4 ± 1.02 months, p = 0.002, 95% CI 1.88–9). In patients, who were treated with CIT, there was no difference in PFS in those with or without AMT in the month before therapy (10 ± 2.5 vs. 6 ± 1.2 months, p = 0.7). Interestingly, AMT during CIT or CPI therapy showed no effect on PFS.ConclusionsIn a real-life setting, we found that AMT reduces PFS when given in the month before CIT therapy. AMT before or during CIT does not seem to influence PFS. As a consequence, AMT before start of therapy might be a factor that could lead to a preference of CIT instead of CPI in NSCLC stage IV patients.",0
"PurposeLong intergenic non-coding RNA LINC01088 is a newly discovered long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Its biological function in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown.MethodsHere, 36 paired CRC and para-cancerous tissues were collected. In vitro, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, qPCR, western blotting analysis and cellular functional experiments, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and dual-luciferase reporter system analysis were performed. In vivo, xenograft tumor mouse models were generated. Besides, patient-derived intestinal organoid (PDO) was generated ex vivo.ResultsWe found that LINC01088 was significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues and CRC cell lines compared to adjacent normal tissues and colonic epithelial cells. High LINC01088 levels were correlated with adverse outcomes in patients with CRC. LINC01088 was mainly located in the cytoplasm. LINC01088 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and immune escape of colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, LINC01088 bound directly to miR-548b-5p and miR-548c-5p that were significantly upregulated Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins 1 (G3BP1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, altering CRC cell phenotypes. In mouse xenograft models, LINC01088 knockdown restrained CRC tumor growth and lung metastasis. Furthermore, G3BP1 overexpression reversed LINC01088-knockdown-mediated inhibitory effects on tumor growth. Notably, LINC01088 knockdown downregulated PD-L1 expression, while G3BP1 overexpression restored PD-L1 expression in xenograft tumors. Besides, LINC01088 knockdown repressed CRC organoid growth ex vivo.ConclusionOverall, these findings suggested that LINC01088 directly targeted miR-548b-5p and miR-548c-5p, promoting G3BP1 and PD-L1 expression, which facilitated colorectal cancer progression and immune escape.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03981-8.","PurposePolypharmacy is a common problem among older adults. However, its prevalence and impact on the clinical outcomes of anticancer treatment, such as survival and adverse events, in older patients with advanced cancer have not been well investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from Japanese patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 2016 and 2019.ResultsAmong 157 older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients, the prevalence of polypharmacy, defined as ≥ 5 medications, was 59.9% (94/157). The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use, according to the screening tool of older people’s prescription (STOPP) criteria version 2, was 38.2% (60/157). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 3.7 and 5.5 months, respectively (P = 0.0017). The median overall survival (OS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 9.5 and 28.1 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between polypharmacy and OS, but no significant associations between polypharmacy and PFS. Polypharmacy was not associated with immune-related adverse events but was associated with higher rate of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment (59.6% vs. 31.7%, P < 0.001).ConclusionPolypharmacy is an independent prognostic factor in older patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI. Also, polypharmacy could be utilized as a simple indicator of patients’ comorbidities and symptoms or as a predictive marker of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03252-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"Over the years, nanotechnology has gained popularity as a viable solution to address gene and drug delivery challenges over conventional methods. Extensive research has been conducted on nanosystems that consist of organic/inorganic materials, drugs, and its biocompatibility become the primary goal of improving drug delivery. Various surface modification methods help focus targeted and controlled drug release, further enabling multidrug delivery also. This newer technology ensures the stability of drugs that can unravel the mechanisms involved in cellular processes of disease development and its management. Tailored medication delivery provides benefits such as therapy, controlled release, and reduced adverse effects, which are especially important for controlling illnesses like cancer. However, multifunctional nanocarriers that possess high viscoelasticity, extended circulation half-life, biocompatibility, and biodegradability face some challenges and limitations too in human bodies. To produce a consistent therapeutic platform based on complex three-dimensional nanoparticles, careful design and engineering, thorough orthogonal analysis methods, and reproducible scale-up and manufacturing processes will be required in the future. Safety and effectiveness of nano-based drug delivery should be thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical trials, especially when considering biodistribution, targeting specific areas, and potential immunological toxicities. Overall, the current review article explores the advancements in nanotechnology, specific to nanomaterial-enabled drug delivery systems, carrier fabrication techniques and modifications, disease management, clinical research, applications, limitations, and future challenges. The work portrays how nanomedicine distribution affects healthcare with an emphasis on the developments in drug delivery techniques.","Multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) can be achieved using different commercially available platforms, often making use of conjugated antibodies detected in iterative cycles. A growing portfolio of pre-conjugated antibodies is offered by the providers, as well as the possibility for in-house conjugation. For many conjugation methods and kits, there are limitations in which antibodies can be used, and conjugation results are sometimes irreproducible. The conjugation process can limit or slow down the progress of studies requiring conjugation of essential markers needed for a given project. Here, we demonstrate a protocol combining manual indirect immunofluorescence (IF) of primary antibodies, followed by antibody elution and staining with multiplexed panels of commercially pre-conjugated antibodies on the PhenoCycler platform. We present detailed protocols for applying the workflow on fresh frozen and formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. We also provide a ready to use workflow for coregistration of the images and demonstrate this for two examples.",0
"Bispecific antibodies are an important tool for the management and treatment of acute leukemias. As a next step toward clinical translation of engineered plasma cells, we describe approaches for secretion of bispecific antibodies by human plasma cells. We show that human plasma cells expressing either fragment crystallizable domain-deficient anti-CD19 × anti-CD3 (blinatumomab) or anti-CD33 × anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies mediate T cell activation and direct T cell killing of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro. We demonstrate that knockout of the self-expressed antigen, CD19, boosts anti-CD19-bispecific secretion by plasma cells and prevents self-targeting. Plasma cells secreting anti-CD19-bispecific antibodies elicited in vivo control of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived xenografts in immunodeficient mice co-engrafted with autologous T cells. In these studies, we found that leukemic control elicited by engineered plasma cells was similar to CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells. Finally, the steady-state concentration of anti-CD19 bispecifics in serum 1 month after cell delivery and tumor eradication was comparable with that observed in patients treated with a steady-state infusion of blinatumomab. These findings support further development of ePCs for use as a durable delivery system for the treatment of acute leukemias, and potentially other cancers.","The crucial role of steroid hormones in health and diseases merits their high-throughput, accurate and affordable measurements in biological specimens. Despite advances in analytical methods, sensing and quantifying steroid hormones remains challenging. Immunoassays offer excellent sensitivity but are inherently labour-intensive, costly, and prone to false positives. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been increasingly utilised, with the main hurdle being the isobaric tendencies of similar analytes, which complicates their separation and accurate quantification. This study compares ultrahigh-performance supercritical fluid chromatography separation (UHPSFC) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) for MS detection. It optimises the column chemistry, temperature, and pressure to provide an operational protocol for the resolution and quantification of analytes. It presents the systematic characterisation of UHPSFC-MS performance by investigating spiked blood samples using Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) and describes the matrix effects associated with MS measurements. Although both separation methods showed adequate resolution, specificity, and retention time, UHPSFC-MS was superior for five out of seven columns tested. With added high-throughput capacities, UHPSFC-MS, thus, offers an optimal solution for the analysis of steroid hormones for research, medical chemistry, and clinical diagnostics.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDImmunotherapy is an effective personalized treatment for several cancers. Radiogenomics in glioblastoma patients may serve as pre-operative biomarkers of the tumor-host immune apparatus. Validated biomarkers would have the potential to stratify patients during immunotherapy clinical trials, and if trials are beneficial, facilitate personalized neo-adjuvant treatment. The aim of the study is to identify machine learning based radiological biomarkers that can predict immune status within the tumor microenvironment of IDH wildtype glioblastoma. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis is a retrospective multicentre machine learning based study utilizing open access anonymized matched radiogenomic data of TCGA-GBM, CPTAC, Ivy GAP and REMBRANDT datasets. REMBRANDT data acted as a hold out dataset for validation. Imaging data consisted of pre-operative MRI based radiomics features extracted from deep learning based segmented tumours. Transcriptomic data-based overall immune scores and cell-specific (T cells and tumour associated macrophages-TAMS) scores were extracted using CIBERSORTx. Outliers were identified and filtered using principal component analysis. Combat and neuroCombat were utilized for data harmonization of genomic and imaging data respectively. Radiomic feature selection was performed using LASSO technique with cross validation. Support vector machine (SVM) was trained and tested with 80:20 radiomic data split, and binary labels based on  overall immune scores, and  immune cell-specific scores. Data query and analysis was performed using python. RESULTSOne hundred and one patients with 15 in the hold out dataset were included in the study. Trained SVM models predicted the labels for immune score and cell-specific scores (T cells -CD4, CD8; TAMS - M0, M1, M2) with AUC of 0.93, 0.79, 0.86, 0.81, 0.95, 0.76; balanced accuracy of 0.72, 0.82, 0.93, 0.80, 0.86, 0.71 respectively. In the holdout set, the models predicted the labels with robust prediction sensitivity for overall immune scores (100%) and M2 (M2 pro-tumour subtype macrophages) scores (75%) and with robust prediction specificity for T cell scores (CD4: 100%, CD8: 90%) along with M0 (M0 precursor pro-tumour macrophages) (62.5%) and M1 (M1 anti-tumour subtype macrophages) (83%) scores. The radiomic signature employed for prediction models were a group of first order and second order radiomic features obtained after feature selection. CONCLUSIONA radiogenomic SVM model non-invasively predicted immune status in wildtype glioblastoma microenvironment with good accuracy. This model has the potential to be utilized in a prospective glioblastoma clinical trial for immunotherapy.","BackgroundTo date, no comprehensive analysis of gallbladder cancer (GBC) management has been reported. We aimed to identify the publication characteristics and research trends in managing GBC over the past three decades.MethodsWe selected the 100 most cited articles and performed a bibliometric analysis to summarize the publication characteristics, explore research hotspots, and identify research trends in the management of GBC.ResultsThe total citations of the included articles ranged from 123 to 1822. Period II (2001–2010) yielded the highest number of included articles, whereas the lowest was in Period III (2011–2020). The United States and Japan published the most papers, in which the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center and Nagoya University were the leading institutions, respectively. The most influential authors were Blumgart LH and Fong YM from the United States. Cooperation among countries, institutions, and authors was weak. The Annals of Surgery contributed the most articles with the highest number of total citations. The most researched topic was surgery, followed by systemic therapy and adjuvant therapy. Since Period I, the percentage of surgery-related publications continuously decreased (Periods II and III versus Period I, both p < 0.001), with a concomitant increase in those of adjuvant therapy (Period III versus Period I, p = 0.004) and systemic therapy (Period II versus Period I, p = 0.004; Period III versus Period I, p = 0.002).ConclusionsSurgery remains the preferred treatment, while there is a tendency toward adjuvant and systemic therapy in GBC management. An increase in local and international collaboration for managing GBC is required.",0
"BackgroundCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an essential component of the tumor immune microenvironment that are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We aim to investigate the characteristics of CAFs in prostate cancer and develop a biochemical recurrence (BCR)-related CAF signature for predicting the prognosis of PCa patients.MethodsThe bulk RNA-seq and relevant clinical information were obtained from the TCGA and GEO databases, respectively. The infiltration scores of CAFs in prostate cancer patients were calculated using the MCP counter and EPIC algorithms. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was downloaded from the GEO database. Subsequently, univariate Cox regression analysis was employed to identify prognostic genes associated with CAFs. We identified two subtypes (C1 and C2) of prostate cancer that were associated with CAFs via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. In addition, the BCR-related CAF signatures were constructed using Lasso regression analysis. Finally, a nomogram model was established based on the risk score and clinical characteristics of the patients.ResultsInitially, we found that patients with high CAF infiltration scores had shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) times. Subsequently, CAFs in four pairs of tumors and paracancerous tissues were identified. We discovered 253 significantly differentially expressed genes, of which 13 had prognostic significance. Using NMF clustering, we divided PCa patients into C1 and C2 subgroups, with the C1 subgroup having a worse prognosis and substantially enriched cell cycle, homologous recombination, and mismatch repair pathways. Furthermore, a BCR-related CAFs signature was established. Multivariate COX regression analysis confirmed that the BCR-related CAFs signature was an independent prognostic factor for BCR in PCa. In addition, the nomogram was based on the clinical characteristics and risk scores of the patient and demonstrated high accuracy and reliability for predicting BCR. Lastly, our findings indicate that the risk score may be a useful tool for predicting PCa patients’ sensitivity to immunotherapy and drug treatment.ConclusionNMF clustering based on CAF-related genes revealed distinct TME immune characteristics between groups. The BCR-related CAF signature accurately predicted prognosis and immunotherapy response in prostate cancer patients, offering a promising new approach to cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05011-7.","PurposeTo enhance the antitumor effects of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibodies, it is important to reverse cancer-induced immunosuppression. We previously reported that a localized renin–angiotensin system in the tumor microenvironment inhibited tumor immunity via macrophages. In this study, we analyzed the underlying mechanism through which fibroblasts express tumor immunity influenced by the angiotensin receptor.MethodsWe used an angiotensin receptor inhibitor (ARB) to inhibit renin–angiotensin system. Furthermore, angiotensin receptors were knocked out from mice fibroblasts, which were then collected. The fibroblasts and a malignant melanoma were then transfused into a mouse model and tumor immunity response was analyzed.ResultsFibroblasts produced CC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) on renin–angiotensin system stimulation, and this production decreased after ARB administration. In mice with transplanted malignant melanoma, ARB administration resulted in decreased CCL5 concentration in the blood, increase in tumor-infiltrating T cells, decrease in regulatory T cells, as well as an increase in tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. The mice in which the angiotensin receptor knockout fibroblasts and malignant melanoma were transplanted showed a similar decrease in CCL5 concentration and increased tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. Furthermore, ARB and anti-PD-1 antibody were administered in combination, which resulted in significantly better tumor growth inhibition over monotherapy.ConclusionInhibiting renin–angiotensin system restored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibited anti-PD-1 antibodies. Thus, this could be considered a valid approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies.",1
"PurposeItraconazole is an antifungal drug that has been clinically used for over 30 years. In recent years, scholars have discovered that it possesses an anticancer effect. Moreover, its mechanism has been clarified to some degree. What deserves to be mentioned is that itraconazole acting on the Hedgehog pathway has made a new progress in the treatment of cancers. While interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the Hedgehog pathway is largely activated in different cancer cells.ResultThis review tries to highlight the effect of itraconazole on smoothened receptor (SMO) in the Hedgehog pathway, thereby reducing the glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) release and finally exhibiting a range of anticancer effects, promoting apoptosis of cancer cells, and inhibiting proliferation by indirect inhibition of NF-κB pathway and inflammation, moreover, promoting the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, inhibiting the expression of target genes transcribed by GLI such as BCL-2 and Cyclin-D1. Besides, itraconazole increases the number of Bnip3, subsequently, inducing the dissociation of the Beclin-1/BCL-2 binding complex, as a result of ultimately promoting autophagy of cancer cells.ConclusionAs a new anticancer drug, whether itraconazole eventually entering clinical application requires the joint eforts of all scholars. In any case, an in-depth study on itraconazole will bring new hope for cancer patients in the near future.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in Korea. A majority of CRCs are caused by progressive genomic alterations referred to as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The factors that may increase the risk of CRC include obesity and consumption of a high-fat diet, red meat, processed meat, and alcohol. Recently, the role of gut microbiota in the formation, progression and treatment of CRCs has been investigated in depth. An altered gut microbiota can drive carcinogenesis and cause the development of CRC. Studies have also shown the role of gut microbiota in the prevention of CRC and the impact of therapies involving gut microbiota on CRC. Herein, we summarize the current understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in the development of CRC and its therapeutic potential, including the prevention of CRC and in enhancing efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",0
"ABSTRACTBreast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms affecting women worldwide, and it remains a leading cause of both mortality and morbidity. While genetic predisposition plays a critical role in the development of this neoplasm, significant epigenetic dysregulations accompany existing variants. The emergence of acquired drug resistance to current chemotherapeutics poses a significant challenge in managing therapy. However, progress has been made in developing novel agents that directly target epigenetic modifications. These agents, called “epi-drugs,” can be used alone in the clinic or in combination with current treatment regimens, offering the potential to create diversified effects on the disease’s predictive process. Within the scope of this review, general information about the major epigenetic dysregulations in breast cancer will be provided, and their effects on the molecular mechanisms in the carcinogenesis process will be discussed. Furthermore, current treatment approaches for breast cancer will be explored, classifying these epi-drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), histone acetyltransferases (HATIs), and others that have been developed to target these mechanisms. Predictions regarding the future prospects of these epi-drugs are highlighted, and their contributions to the field of personalized medicine are emphasized based on the results obtained from clinical studies.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly detected cancer with a serious global health issue. The rates for incidence and mortality for CRC are alarming, especially since the prognosis is abysmal when the CRC is diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage. Both type of (modifiable/ non-modifiable) types of risk factors are established for CRC. Despite the advances in recent technology and sophisticated research, the survival rate is still meager due to delays in diagnosis. Therefore, there is urgently required to identify critical biomarkers aiming at early diagnosis and improving effective therapeutic strategies. Additionally, a complete understanding of the dysregulated pathways like PI3K/Akt, Notch, and Wnt associated with CRC progression and metastasis is very beneficial in designing a therapeutic regimen. This review article focused on the dysregulated signaling pathways, genetics and epigenetics alterations, and crucial biomarkers of CRC. This review also provided the list of clinical trials targeting signaling cascades and therapies involving small molecules. This review discusses up-to-date information on novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies alongside specific clinical trials.",1
"The study investigated the efficacy of Campomanesia xanthocarpa infusions on human melanoma cells (SK-MEL-28). The phytochemical profile revealed 18 phenolic compounds in the leaf infusion and 9 in the fruit infusion. After 24 h of treatment, the infusions demonstrated antineoplastic effects, reducing cell viability at all tested concentrations for the leaf infusion. For the fruit infusion, a significant reduction in cell viability was observed specifically at the 800 μg/mL concentration. Fluorescence microscopy and mitochondrial membrane potential results indicated that the leaf infusion was more effective in reducing cell viability and mitochondrial function in SK-MEL-28 cells, possibly due to its greater variety of phenolic compounds compared to the fruit infusion. The leaf infusion also induced higher production of intracellular reactive oxygen species compared to the fruit infusion. Protein sulfhydryl levels were reduced for the leaf infusion. Epigallocatechin gallate, Isoquercitrin, Rutin, Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, Chlorogenic acid, and Ellagic acid were identified as the main compounds with activity against SK-MEL-28 cells. Molecular docking analysis underscored factors such as affinity, cavity size, binding mode, and contact residues with specific compounds chosen for their favorable properties in targeting BRAF, CDK4, CDK6, MEK1, and MEK2. The variability in binding affinities may directly influence the compounds' ability to inhibit different signaling pathways related to cancer cell growth and proliferation. The results suggest that phenolic compounds from C. xanthocarpa extracts have therapeutic potential and could contribute to melanoma therapies.Supplementary informationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00286-1.","ObjectiveThis investigation seeks to explore the mechanism of quercetin in oral cancer by incorporating network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking.MethodsFirst, we use the network pharmacology analysis to discover possible core targets for quercetin and oral cancer. We subsequently utilized the docking of molecules techniques to calculate the affinities of critical targets and quercetin for verification.ResultsTCMSP and the Swiss Target Prediction database found 190 quercetin action targets, while GeneCards, OMIM, PharmGkb, and the Therapeutic Target Database found 8971 oral cancer-related targets. Venny 2.1.0 online software conducted an intersection analysis of quercetin-related target information with information about oral cancer, and 172 putative quercetin-anti-oral cancer targets were examined. Six prospective core targets for quercetin treatment of oral cancer were identified from the PPI network topology analysis of 172 putative therapeutic targets. These targets include AKT1, PIK3R1, MYC, HIF1A, SRC, and HSP90AA1. GO enrichment function analysis showed that 2372 biological processes, 98 cell components, and 201 molecular functions were involved. Through enrichment analysis of the KEGG pathway, 172 signal pathways were obtained. A few examples are PI3K-AKT, HIF-1, IL-17, and other signaling pathways. The molecular docking scores of quercetin and the primary therapeutic targets AKT1, HIF1A, HSP90AA1, MYC, PIK3R1, and SRC are all less than -0.7 points, demonstrating good compatibility between the medicine and small molecules and suggesting that quercetin may affect oral cancer through the primary target.ConclusionThis study explores quercetin’s mechanism and possible targets for oral cancer treatment, offering novel approaches. Quercetin may be a multitarget medication against oral cancer in the future.",1
"PurposeBecause patients younger than 40 years are rarely enrolled in clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their survival benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) needs to be clarified.MethodsThe National Cancer Database was queried for patients who were diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC between 2016 and 2018. ICIs were administered in the first-line setting. The overall survival (OS) of patients with stage IV NSCLC according to the receipt of ICIs was compared in different age groups (< 40, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years). Multivariate analyses identified the clinical characteristics predictive of OS. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to reduce the biases arising from clinical characteristics.ResultsThis study included 126,476 patients with stage IV NSCLC. In univariate analysis, ICI treatment was not associated with a survival benefit in patients younger than 40 years with stage IV NSCLC relative to their ICI-naïve counterparts after PSM (median OS: 24.2 months vs. 24.0 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81–1.27, P = 0.9031). Multivariate analysis revealed that ICI use was not an independent predictor of OS in patients with stage IV NSCLC < 40 years old (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.76–1.21, P = 0.7230). Sequential improvement of the HR was observed with increasing age.ConclusionOur study suggested a poor survival benefit of ICIs in stage IV NSCLC patients younger than 40 years old, which should be validated in prospective studies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05167-2.","PurposeProgrammed death ligand 1(PD-L1)/programmed cell death-1(PD-1) inhibitors have shown promising efficacy in unresectable patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the results are not consistent. Our goal was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors or plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody or anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of unresectable HCC.MethodsCochrane library, Embase, and PubMed were searched till August 2021. Data on progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and disease control rate (DCR) were pooled and analyzed by Stata14 software.ResultsThirteen prospective trials with 2,386 HCC patients were included. Pooled analysis estimated an ORR of about 0.21 (95% CI = 0.18–0.25) and a DCR of 0.59 (95% CI = 0.52–0.65) for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Summary PFS was 4.19 (95% CI = 3.31–5.18) months and summary OS was 13.23 (95% CI = 12.06–14.41) months. After using PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors plus anti-VEGF agents, ORR was 0.26 (95% CI = 0.20–0.33), DCR was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.69–0.81) and PFS was 6.2 (95% CI = 4.61–7.78) months. PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy achieved an ORR of 0.23 (95% CI = 0.14–0.33), an DCR of 0.44 (95% CI = 0.39–0.50) and a PFS of 1.88 (95% CI = 1.51–2.26).ConclusionsPD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors were effective and tolerable in patients with advanced HCC. Furthermore, compared with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy, PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors plus anti-VEGF agents resulted in more clinical improvements in ORR, DCR, and PFS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04057-3.",1
"AbstractSonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a novel cancer treatment type showing the advantages of high tissue penetration ability, non‐invasion, low systemic toxicity, and high selectivity. However, SDT depends on ultrasound (US) irradiation; once US is turned off, the sonosensitizer will stop producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, most sonosensitizers generate oxygen‐dependent ROS, that is, singlet oxygen (1O2), significantly limiting the therapeutic effect of SDT in treating deep and hypoxic tumor. Therefore, combining SDT with other treatment modalities is essential. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of cisplatin‐coordinated copolythiophenes (CPT‐Pts), simultaneously generating 1O2, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals for synergistic chemotherapy and SDT of tumor. The sonodynamic toxicity and cytotoxicity of CPT‐Pts were accurately regulated by tuning the monomer ratio of the polythiophene. This copolymerization strategy avoids the side effects originating from the high‐dose chemotherapy drug while making up for limiting SDT relying on ultrasonic activation, effectively inhibiting cancer cells and tumors.","Innate immunity, cell death and inflammation underpin many aspects of health and disease. Upon sensing pathogens, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or alarmins, the innate immune system activates inflammatory cell death, such as pyroptosis and PANoptosis. These genetically-defined, regulated cell death pathways not only contribute to the host defense against infectious disease, but also promote pathological manifestations leading to cancer and inflammatory diseases. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms has grown rapidly in recent years. However, how dying cells, cell corpses, and their liberated cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory signalling molecules are further sensed by innate immune cells, and their contribution to further amplify inflammation, trigger antigen presentation, and activate adaptive immunity, is less clear. Here, we discuss how pattern-recognition and PANoptosome sensors in innate immune cells recognize and respond to cell-death signatures. We also highlight molecular targets of the innate immune response for potential therapeutic development.",0
"IntroductionIncreasing evidence indicates an important role of microbiota in cancer development and progression, while little is known about the correlation between microbiota and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Thus, we performed this study to profile the intratumoral microbiota possibly associated with RCC.Materials and methodsPaired RCC and adjacent normal tissue samples were collected from 24 patients with RCC. V3-V4 variable region of microbial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing reads were processed using QIIME. Differentially abundant bacterial taxa between groups were identified by LEfSe, and their potential functions were inferred by PICRUSt.ResultsDecreased species diversity was presented in RCC tissues (Simpson index, P = 0.0340), and the composition of the bacterial community in RCC tissues was significantly distinct from that in normal tissues (unweighted UniFrac distance, P = 0.026; weighted UniFrac distance, P = 0.017). Compared with normal tissues, 25 taxa increased and 47 reduced taxa were identified in RCC tissues. Among these taxa, the class Chloroplast (AUC = 0.91, P < 0.0001) and the order Streptophyta (AUC = 0.89, P < 0.0001) showed high indication accuracy to discriminate RCC tissues from normal tissues. Furthermore, nine altered pathways were identified in RCC tissues to reveal the potential microbial function.ConclusionsOur results have uncovered the presence of distinct microbiota in RCC and adjacent normal tissues and provided a better understanding of the possible role of the intratumoral microbiota in RCC. Further studies are required to confirm our results and determine the real correlation between microbiota and RCC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03462-w) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer with a significant impact on loss of life. In 2020, nearly 1.9 million new cases and over 9,35,000 deaths were reported. Numerous microbes that are abundant in the human gut benefit host physiology in many ways. Although the underlying mechanism is still unknown, their association appears to be crucial in the beginning and progression of CRC.SummaryDiet has a significant impact on the microbial composition and may increase the chance of getting CRC. Increasing evidence points to the gut microbiota as the primary initiator of colonic inflammation, which is connected to the development of colonic tumors. However, it is unclear how the microbiota contributes to the development of CRCs. Patients with CRC have been found to have dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, which can be identified by a decline in commensal bacterial species, such as those that produce butyrate, and a concurrent increase in harmful bacterial populations, such as opportunistic pathogens that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. We believe that using probiotics or altering the gut microbiota will likely be effective tools in the fight against CRC treatment.PurposeIn this review, we revisited the association between gut microbiota and colorectal cancer whether cause or effect. The various factors which influence gut microbiome in patients with CRC and possible mechanism in relation with development of CRC.ConclusionThe clinical significance of the intestinal microbiota may aid in the prevention and management of CRC.Graphical abstract",1

"IntroductionOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent malignant condition. This study aimed to investigate the role of mTORC1 signaling and develop a prognostic model for OSCC.Materials and MethodsThe single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was utilized to calculate the Z-Score of Hallmarks in OSCC, followed by univariate Cox regression analysis to identify processes associated with prognosis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed using transcriptomic data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) cohort to identify genes correlated with mTORC1 signaling. A six-gene prognostic model was constructed using multifactorial Cox regression analysis and validated using an external dataset.ResultsThe study uncovered a strong linkage between mTORC1, glycolysis, hypoxia, and the prognosis of OSCC. mTORC1 signaling emerged as the most significant risk factor, negatively impacting patient survival. Additionally, a six-gene prognostic risk score model was developed which provided a quantitative measure of patients' survival probabilities. Interestingly, within the context of these findings, TP53 gene mutations were predominantly observed in the high-risk group, potentially underlining the genetic complexity of this patient subgroup. Additionally, differential immune cell infiltration and an integrated nomogram were also reported.ConclusionThis study highlights the importance of mTORC1 signaling in OSCC prognosis and presents a robust prognostic model for predicting patient outcomes.","ObjectiveTo facilitate immunotherapy and prognostic assessment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we established a novel immunogenomic classification to provide valid identification criteria.MethodsThe immune enrichment scores were calculated by single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and clustered into Immunity_L and Immunity_H, and the reliability of this classification was demonstrated. Immune microenvironment score and immune cell infiltration analysis of NSCLC were also performed. Randomly divided into training group and test group, a prognosis-related immune profile was developed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and stepwise COX proportional hazards model to construct a prognostic mode.ResultsThe risk score for this immune profile was identified as an independent prognostic factor and can be used as a powerful prognostic tool to refine tumor immunotherapy. Our study identified two NSCLC classifications based on immunomic profiling, Immunity_H and Immunity_L.ConclusionIn conclusion, Immunogenomic classification can distinguish the immune status of different types of NSCLC patients and contribute to the immunotherapy of NSCLC patients.",1
"PurposeAnlotinib is an oral small-molecule multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor that hampers neovascularization thus providing antitumor effect. The ALTER 0303 trial was a multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The ALTER 0303 results showed that patients in the anlotinib group had a median progression-free survival of 5.4 months, a significant improvement compared with 1.4 months in the placebo group; however, median overall survival was only extended by 3.3 months (9.6 vs 6.3 months). The problem of anlotinib resistance cannot be ignored, and an in-depth exploration of biomarkers of anlotinib treatment response is urgently needed to further improve the efficacy of anlotinib in the treatment of NSCLC. This study aimed to identify plasma exosome markers that could be used to monitor the efficacy of anlotinib.MethodsWe enrolled 5 patients with advanced NSCLC, and 15 blood samples were collected before anlotinib treatment, when the treatment was effective, and when the treatment was ineffective. The plasma exosomal RNA profiles were analyzed by whole-transcriptome sequencing at three different stages. The expression of dysregulated exosomal RNAs in 43 additional patients was also verified by real-time quantitative PCR.ResultsIn the plasma exosomal RNA profiles of the 5 patients with advanced NSCLC during treatment with anlotinib, 7 miRNAs, 3 lncRNAs, and 83 mRNAs were significantly dysregulated. The regulation trend was opposite when the treatment was effective and ineffective, showing dynamic changes. After validation, we finally found that plasma exosomal lnc-SNAPC5-3:4 was significantly upregulated when anlotinib treatment was effective, and it was significantly downregulated when the treatment failed (p < 0.05). Thus, it can be used as a potential biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of anlotinib.ConclusionOur results demonstrate the potential of plasma exosomal lnc-SNAPC5-3:4 as a biomarker for monitoring anlotinib efficacy.","AbstractINTRODUCTIONStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a cornerstone in the treatment of brain metastasis (BM), despite a known risk of distant intracranial failure (DIF). Recent imaging advances, specifically, sensitive 3D-FSE sequences, have started to be incorporated into SRS practice; however, comparisons of outcomes to historical imaging approaches are limited. We evaluated the impact of adding 3D-FSE to MPRAGE in BM detection and prolongation of DIF in a histology-agnostic patient group. METHODSOutcomes of patients treated with SRS for BM between 01/2019-01/2024 were evaluated. MPRAGE sequences were obtained for all; 3D-FSE sequences were implemented in 02/2020. Median times to DIF were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS215 patients underwent 332 SRS courses for 1456 BM imaged with MPRAGE and 3D-FSE (primary cohort), compared to the control cohort (92 patients, 135 SRS courses, 462 BM). MPRAGE sequences revealed 1636 lesions in 307 patients (462 in 92 control cohort, 1174 in 215 primary cohort). In the primary cohort, an additional 282 lesions were identified with 3D-FSE (24% increase) by neuroradiologists and multidisciplinary review. There was a statistically significant prolongation in the median time to DIF between the cohorts (11.4 vs. 6.8 months, p=0.029), most pronounced in the 1-4 metastases subgroup (14.7 vs. 8.1 months, p=0.008) and in those with a single BM (36.4 vs. 10.9 months, p=0.001). While patients relapsing on immunotherapy or targeted therapy did not significantly benefit from 3D-FSE (7.2 vs. 5.7 months, p=0.280), those who relapsed on chemotherapy or were off systemic therapy at least four weeks prior to SRS (including synchronous metastases) exhibited a trend towards longer time to DIF with 3D-FSE (14.7 vs. 7.9 months, p=0.057). CONCLUSIONS3D-FSE added to MPRAGE lengthens time to DIF via improving BM detection, especially for limited BM, and those relapsing on systemic therapy with limited intracranial penetration or no systemic therapy.",0
"Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is a rare, biologically aggressive variant of endometrial cancer with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. HER2 overexpression (3+ positivity) by IHC and/or FISH ERBB2 gene amplification is detected in approximately one-third of patients with USC. Clinical trials incorporating trastuzumab with standard chemotherapy have recently demonstrated improved progression-free and overall survival in advanced-stage or recurrent USC that overexpresses HER2. However, a large number of patients with USC eventually developed resistance to trastuzumab. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a novel HER2-directed antibody–drug conjugate with a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for multiple tumor indications. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of T-DXd in primary USC cell lines and xenografts with different HER2 expression. T-DXd-induced cell growth suppression in HER2-overexpressing cell lines in vitro, increased early and late apoptosis as assessed by annexin and propidium iodide staining, and, similarly to trastuzumab, T-DXd-induced significant antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in the presence of peripheral blood lymphocytes. While negligible activity was detected against USC cell lines with low HER2 expression, T-DXd demonstrated significant bystander killing against USC tumors with low/negligible HER2 when such cells were admixed with HER2 3+ tumor cells in vitro. T-DXd showed tumor growth suppression in in vivo USC PDX models that overexpress HER2 at 3+ levels, prolonging survival when compared with controls, with minimal toxicity. Future clinical trials are warranted in patients with USC failing trastuzumab treatment.","BackgroundTumor vaccines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an area of intense interest. Tremendous clinical trials have been conducted globally, but the efficacy and security of tumor vaccines are elusive. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and security of tumor vaccines.MethodsAll relevant studies were identified in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science and Cochrane Library databases. Objective response rate (ORR), median overall survival (OS), or median progression-free survival (PFS) and 95% CI were meta-analyzed based on the random-effects model. The individual-level data of OS, PFS were pooled by conducting survival analysis. All observed adverse events were collected.Results31 studies containing 35 eligible cohorts with 932 HCC patients were included. The pooled ORR were 7% (95% CI 3–14%), while ORR of dendritic cell (DC) vaccine (19%, 95% CI 11–29%) were highly significant than ORR of peptide vaccine (1%, 95% CI 0–5%). The pooled median OS and PFS were 13.67 months (95% CI 8.20–22.80) and 6.19 months (95% CI 2.97–12.91), respectively. The pooled median OS (DC vaccine: median OS = 21.77 months, 95% CI 18.33–25.86; Peptide vaccine: median OS = 10.08 months, 95% CI 5.23–19.44) and PFS (DC vaccine: median PFS = 11.01 months, 95% CI 5.25–23.09; Peptide vaccine: median PFS = 1.97 months, 95% CI 1.53–2.54) of DC vaccine were also longer than that of peptide vaccine. HBV-related HCC may acquire more benefits from tumor vaccines than HCV-related HCC. In almost all studies, the observed toxicities were moderate even tiny.ConclusionsTumor vaccines for HCC, especially DC vaccine, are safe and worth exploring. More high-quality prospective studies are warranted.",0

However, clinical translation of first-generation inhibitors has shown little success. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of HYL001, a potent inhibitor of TGFβ receptor 1 (ALK5), that is approximately 9 times more efficacious than the structurally related compound galunisertib, while maintaining a favorable safety profile. HYL001 in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1) eradicates liver metastases generated in mice by microsatellite stable, aggressive colorectal cancer tumors at doses where galunisertib is ineffective.","High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive and non-ionizing sonic energy-based therapeutic technology for inducing thermal and non-thermal effects in tissues. Depending on the parameters, HIFU can ablate tissues by heating them to >55 °C to induce denaturation and coagulative necrosis, improve radio- and chemo-sensitizations and local drug delivery from nanoparticles at moderate hyperthermia (∼41–43 °C), and mechanically fragment cells using acoustic cavitation (also known as histotripsy). HIFU has already emerged as an attractive modality for treating human & veterinary cancers, infectious diseases, and neuromodulation. Herein, we comprehensively review the role of HIFU in enhancing drug delivery and immunomodulation in soft and calcified tissues. Specifically, the ability of HIFU to improve adjuvant treatments from various classes of therapeutic agents are described. These crucial insights highlight the opportunities and challenges of HIFU technology and its potential to support new clinical trials and translation to patients.",0
"Bispecific antibodies are an important tool for the management and treatment of acute leukemias. As a next step toward clinical translation of engineered plasma cells, we describe approaches for secretion of bispecific antibodies by human plasma cells. We show that human plasma cells expressing either fragment crystallizable domain-deficient anti-CD19 × anti-CD3 (blinatumomab) or anti-CD33 × anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies mediate T cell activation and direct T cell killing of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro. We demonstrate that knockout of the self-expressed antigen, CD19, boosts anti-CD19-bispecific secretion by plasma cells and prevents self-targeting. Plasma cells secreting anti-CD19-bispecific antibodies elicited in vivo control of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived xenografts in immunodeficient mice co-engrafted with autologous T cells. In these studies, we found that leukemic control elicited by engineered plasma cells was similar to CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells. Finally, the steady-state concentration of anti-CD19 bispecifics in serum 1 month after cell delivery and tumor eradication was comparable with that observed in patients treated with a steady-state infusion of blinatumomab. These findings support further development of ePCs for use as a durable delivery system for the treatment of acute leukemias, and potentially other cancers.","AbstractBackgroundEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ and EBV- primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) carry distinct mutational landscapes, but their transcriptional and epigenetic profiles have not been integrated and compared. This precludes further insights into pathobiology and molecular differences, relevant for classification and targeted therapy.MethodsTwenty-three EBV- and 15 EBV+ PCNSL, histologically classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, were subjected to RNA-sequencing and EPIC methylation arrays. Unsupervised clustering analyses were performed. Differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes were identified and integrated.ResultsTwo distinct transcriptional clusters were found, which separated EBV- and EBV+ PCNSL (P < .0001). The EBV+ transcriptional signature contained genes (GPR15, FCER2/CD23, SLAMF1/CD150) closely regulated by EBV oncogenes in B cells. Pathway enrichment analysis uncovered enhanced B-cell receptor (BCR) and WNT/beta-catenin signaling in EBV- lymphomas, whereas Interleukin-10, NOTCH, and viral life cycle pathways were upregulated in EBV+ PCNSL. Correspondingly, BCR-associated SYK kinase activity was enriched in EBV- tumors while JAK2 was overrepresented in EBV+ PCNSL. Epigenetic profiling revealed reduced global promoter methylation in EBV+ PCNSL. Two methylation clusters were recognized, which separated EBV- and EBV+ PCNSL (P < .0001). Epigenetic profiles were distinct from 2,788 other brain tumor and nonmalignant reference samples. Promoter region hypermethylation of CD79B, a BCR subunit critical for sustained proliferation in EBV- disease, highly correlated (R = −0.7) with its transcriptional downregulation in EBV+ PCNSL.ConclusionsEBV+ and EBV- PCNSL harbor distinct transcriptional and epigenetic profiles, corroborating them as distinctive biological subtypes. Uncovered differences provide novel insights into their pathobiology, may guide molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies.",0
"ABSTRACTNosocomial infections during immunotherapy pose a dilemma in the treatment of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, where a lack of consensus guidelines for this rare disease marks a significant gap in the existing knowledge. This case reports about an 18-year-old female diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who was found to be refractory to first- and second-line treatment. During her hospital stay, the patient encountered nearly six episodes of infection, which delayed the use of next-line intervention. It was observed that switching over to the next line of treatment during infections may produce sub-therapeutic outcomes. Thereby, the case highlights the need for de-escalation and appropriate selection of immunosuppression therapy during nosocomial infections and how monotherapy with the patient-tolerated first-line agent can be appropriate during infection.","AbstractPurposeThis narrative review summarizes the evidence for nutrition, exercise, and multimodal interventions to maintain weight and muscle mass and prevent malnutrition from meta-analysis, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials published within the last 5 years, and in comparison to future research priority areas identified by international guidelines.Recent findingsDietary counseling with oral nutrition support (ONS), escalated to enteral nutrition if weight loss continues, is the gold standard treatment approach to maintaining weight and preventing malnutrition. Recent ONS trials with dietary counseling show promising findings for weight maintenance, extending the literature to include studies in chemoradiotherapy, however, change in body composition is rarely evaluated. Emerging trials have evaluated the impact of isolated nutrients, amino acids, and their derivatives (ie, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate) on muscle mass albeit with mixed effects. There is insufficient evidence evaluating the effect of exercise interventions on unintentional weight loss, muscle mass, and malnutrition, however, our knowledge of the impact of multimodal nutrition and exercise interventions is advancing. Prehabilitation interventions may attenuate weight and muscle loss after surgery, particularly for patients having gastrointestinal and colorectal surgery. Multimodal trials that commence during treatment show mixed effects on weight and muscle mass when measured.SummaryThis review highlights that the evidence for preventing unintentional weight loss and malnutrition from cancer treatment is strong within nutrition. Multimodal interventions are emerging as effective interventions to prevent unintentional weight loss. Promising interventions are demonstrating improvements in muscle mass, however further exploration through studies designed to determine the effect on muscle is required.",0
"AbstractBackgroundUsing immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO) is a promising approach to maximize clinical benefits for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-L1 expression serves as a predictive factor for treatment outcomes with IO. However, the high cost of this treatment creates significant barriers to access. Substantial evidence demonstrates the sustained clinical benefits experienced by patients who respond to immunotherapy. While IOs show promise in NSCLC treatment, their high cost poses access barriers.AimThis study focused on a prospective cost analysis conducted at a high-specialty health facility to assess the economic implications of implementing a risk-sharing agreement (RSA) for atezolizumab in NSCLC.MethodsThe study included 30 patients with advanced NSCLC, with the pharmaceutical company funding the initial cycles. If patients responded, a government program covered costs until disease progression.ResultsA median progression-free survival of 4.67 months across populations, rising to 9.4 months for responders. The 2-year overall survival rate for the response group was 64%, significantly higher than for non-response. Without an RSA, a total treatment cost of $881 859.36 ($29 395.31/patient) was reported, compared to $530 467.12 ($17 682.24/patient) with an RSA, representing a 40% cost reduction. In responders, the average cost per year of life per patient dropped by 22%. Risk-sharing, assessed through non-parametric tests, showed a statistically significant difference in pharmacological costs (P < .001).ConclusionImplementing RSAs can optimize resource allocation, making IO treatment more accessible, especially in low-income countries.","AbstractMicrosatellite instability (MSI) is an important biomarker in cancer. While routine methods can detect MSI in certain tumor types, in other tumor types the results may be incorrect due to differences in the MSI loci pattern. Here, we report the case of a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with confirmed MSI by two independent next-generation sequencing tests, but not by routine methods, who had progression on pembrolizumab. Comparison of the patient’s MSI loci patterns with MSI+ colorectal adenocarcinoma samples showed a lower fraction of unstable loci, low resolution of a second peak in the repeat length spectrum of unstable short tandem repeats in the patient's sample, and a lower length of indels (3.7 vs 4.5 base pairs, p < 0.01).",1
"Aim: Studies on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related potential neurological adverse events (pNAEs) in Korean lung cancer (LC) patients are scarce. We aimed to examine ICI prescription trends from 2018 to 2022, patient characteristics and factors associated with ICI prescription or concurrent pNAEs in LC.Research design & methods: This observational, cross-sectional study of Korean LC patients investigated four ICIs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab). The annual ICI prescription rate was calculated by dividing the number of LC patients prescribed ICIs with the total annual number of LC patients. Factors associated with ICI prescriptions or concurrent pNAEs were assessed.Results: The annual ICI prescription rate increased from 3.29% to 9.74% (average: 6.20%). Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were associated with more ICI prescriptions (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.08). Targeted therapy was associated with fewer prescriptions (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.41–0.49). The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) prescription rate was higher in patients with concurrent pNAEs than those without pNAEs (53.09% vs. 50.84%), and this was associated with higher pNAEs prevalence (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03–1.18).Conclusion: ICI prescription for LC has increased in Korea, CCI and anti-PD-1 increased pNAEs prevalence.","A significant clinical challenge in lung cancer treatment is management of the inevitable acquired resistance to third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs), such as osimertinib, which have shown remarkable success in the treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations, in order to achieve maximal response duration or treatment remission. Apoptosis is a major type of programmed cell death tightly associated with cancer development and treatment. Evasion of apoptosis is considered a key hallmark of cancer and acquisition of apoptosis resistance is accordingly a key mechanism of drug acquired resistance in cancer therapy. It has been clearly shown that effective induction of apoptosis is a key mechanism for third generation EGFR-TKIs, particularly osimertinib, to exert their therapeutic efficacies and the development of resistance to apoptosis is tightly associated with the emergence of acquired resistance. Hence, restoration of cell sensitivity to undergo apoptosis using various means promises an effective strategy for the management of acquired resistance to third generation EGFR-TKIs.",1
"Background:Axitinib plus pembrolizumab showed superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) versus sunitinib in a randomised phase III trial in patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). We report long-term efficacy and safety of the axitinib/pembrolizumab from the phase I trial (NCT02133742), after 46–55 months from study initiation (data cut-off date, 23rd July 2019).Methods:Fifty-two treatment-naïve patients with advanced RCC were treated with oral axitinib 5 mg twice daily and intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. PFS, duration of response (DoR) and OS were summarised using the Kaplan–Meier method.Results:At a median follow-up of 42.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.1–44.1), median OS was not reached; 38 (73.1%) patients were alive. The probability of being alive at 4 years was 66.8% (95% CI: 49.1–79.5). Median PFS in the overall population was 23.5 months (95% CI: 15.4–30.4). ORR was 73.1%; five patients had complete response. Median DoR was 22.1 months (95% CI: 15.1–34.5). Grade III/IV adverse events (AEs) were reported in 38 (73.1%) patients and 20 (38.5%) discontinued treatment because of AEs: 17 (32.7%) discontinued axitinib, 13 (25.0%) discontinued pembrolizumab, and 10 (19.2%) discontinued both drugs. Common AEs included diarrhoea (84.6%), fatigue (80.8%), hypertension (53.8%), cough (48.1%) and dysphonia (48.1%). There were no new AE terms reported and no treatment-related deaths.Conclusions:In patients with advanced RCC with ~4 years of follow-up, combination axitinib/pembrolizumab continued to demonstrate clinical benefit, with no new safety signals.","Background:The COVID-19 vaccine was initially offered to frontline health care workers (HCWs), due to high risk of contracting COVID-19 through occupational exposure to patients. Low HCW vaccine uptake can impact overall community level vaccine uptake. This study used the diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory to understand factors related to COVID-19 vaccine uptake in HCWs.Methods:We surveyed Pennsylvanian HCWs (excluding Philadelphia) from August 2022 - February 2023. Survey questions inquired about demographics, COVID-19 vaccination status, reasons for receiving/declining the COVID-19 vaccine, and sources of information about the vaccine.Results:Participants (n=3490) were 85% female, 89% White, and 93% (n=3255) reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. HCWs were categorized into adopter categories of the DOI theory: innovators (56%), early adopters (9%), early majority (11%), late majority (7%), and laggards (17%). The major reason that prompted participants to get the vaccine were to protect them against COVID-19 infection (78%), while the major reason for declining the vaccine was due to concern about possible side effects from the vaccine (78%).Conclusion:Our findings suggest that increasing awareness, education, and trust in government and health officials regarding the COVID-19 vaccine may further promote and increase vaccine uptake.",0
"AbstractTherapies shown to improve outcomes in patients with recurrent cancers are commonly used in the neoadjuvant setting to optimize surgery, reduce radiation fields, and treat micrometastatic disease. While the use of pre-radiation chemotherapy (PRC) has flourished in systemic cancers, it has not seen the same level of use in glioblastomas. This review documents these trajectories and highlights the potential of PRC to rapidly and safely screen cytotoxic drugs for efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.Prospective trials of adults with newly diagnosed systemic and brain cancers treated with PRC published between 1980 and 2023 were identified in PubMed. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were used to document the standard use of PRC in patients with systemic and brain cancers.Over 5000 prospective PRC trials in solid tumors were identified. These accrued >1 million patients and resulted in neoadjuvant therapies being the standard of care in ~28 systemic cancers. Only 50 similar trials (2206 patients) were identified in high-grade gliomas. In 13 trials containing PRC temozolomide (n = 846), radiographic responses ranged from 6 to 53% with a median survival of ~13 months. Glioblastoma PRC trials were not associated with unexpected toxicities or major negative impacts on survival. Pre-radiation chemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma appears safe and feasible. The pre-radiation window is ideally suited to rapidly screen cytotoxic agents for efficacy. It permits radiographic response as a primary outcome, small sample sizes, and initiation of standard therapies a few months after diagnosis. Pre-radiation chemotherapy may be most appropriate for patients with glioblastoma who are unlikely to benefit from temozolomide.","AbstractBackgroundThe discovery of glioblastoma (GBM)-initiating cells (GICs) has impacted GBM research. These cells are not only tumorigenic but also exhibit resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize GICs thoroughly and identify new therapeutic targets. In a previous study, we successfully identified epithelial-V–like antigen 1 (EVA1) as a novel functional factor specific to GICs.MethodsHybridoma cells were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with EVA1-Fc fusion protein. The reactivity of the supernatant from these hybridoma cells was examined using EVA1-overexpressing cells and GICs. Candidate antibodies were further selected using Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis and 2 cytotoxicity assays—antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Among the antibodies, the cytotoxicity of the B2E5-antibody drug conjugate (B2E5-ADC) was evaluated by both adding it to cultured GICs and injecting it into GIC tumor-bearing brains.ResultsB2E5 demonstrated a high affinity for human EVA1 and effectively killed both EVA1-expressing cell lines and GICs in culture through ADCC and CDC. B2E5-ADC also exhibited strong cytotoxicity to GICs in culture and prevented their tumorigenesis in the brain when administered intracranially to the tumor-bearing brain.ConclusionOur data indicate that B2E5-ADC is a new and promising therapeutic strategy for GBM.",1
"Background and aimAccording to previous reports, GTPase of immunity-associated protein 6 (GIMAP6) is essential for autophagy. However, it is unclear how GIMAP6 affects the development and tumor immunity of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).MethodsIn the present study, the role of GIMAP6 in vivo and in vitro was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting, and Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and Transwell assays. Datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were thoroughly analyzed using R software. A nomogram was created using GIMAP6 and prognostic characteristics. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were applied to explore the potential mechanism of GIMAP6 in lung cancer. The link between GIMAP6 and the immunological landscape was studied using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0 and Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub.ResultsPatients with high GIMAP6 expression had improved overall and disease-specific survival compared with those patients with low GIMAP6 expression. According to the receiver operating characteristic and calibration curve, the nomogram based on T stage, N stage and GIMAP6 had predictive value for prognosis. According to functional enrichment analysis, GIMAP6 was primarily involved in T-cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction. GIMAP6 was shown to be favorably linked with the infiltration of immune cells and immune-related molecules, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, programmed death-ligand 1, and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, by single-cell sequencing and TIMER2.0 analysis. The role of GIMAP6 in lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and immunity was experimentally verified.ConclusionThese findings confirmed that GIMAP6 was an effective prognostic molecule that was involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment of LUAD, and may become a predictor for the efficacy of immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04980-z.","BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. The progression of numerous malignancies has been linked to abnormal vesicle-mediated transport-related gene (VMTRG) expression. The prognostic importance of VMTRGs in HCC is uncertain nonetheless.MethodsUtilizing HCC data from TCGA and ICGC, we employed univariate cox analysis, unsupervised clustering, and lasso analysis to construct molecular subtypes and prognostic signature of HCC based on the prognostic-associated VMTRGs expression levels. Subsequently, we validated the expression levels of the signature genes. We investigated the probable pathways using gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Six methods were utilized to compare immune cell infiltration between two risk groups. Moreover, the “pRRophetic” algorithm was utilized to test the drug sensitivity of both groups.ResultsWe identified two distinct subtypes with divergent biological behaviors and immune functionality through unsupervised clustering. Subtype C1 demonstrated a poorer prognosis. A prognostic signature incorporating two VMTRGs (KIF2C and RAC1) was formulated. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analyses unveiled a significant upregulation of these pivotal genes within HCC tissues. The prognosis was worse for the high-risk group, which also had a higher clinicopathological grade, higher levels of tumor mutation burden (TMB), a higher immunological infiltration of CD8 + T cells, a higher expression of immune checkpoints, and enhanced immunotherapy efficacy. These two risk groups also have varied chemotherapy drug sensitivities.ConclusionsBased on VMTRGs, we have developed a signature that assists in accurate prognosis prediction and formulating personalized treatment strategies for HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05079-1.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with poor clinical outcomes due to challenges in early detection and limited efficacy of current treatments such as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy. HCC exhibits significant heterogeneity at both histopathological and molecular levels, complicating its management but offering potential for personalized therapeutic approaches. This review outlines the morpho-molecular heterogeneity of HCC and summarizes various histological subtypes, including steatohepatitic, clear cell, macrotrabecular-massive, scirrhous, lymphocyte-rich, and fibrolamellar HCCs. Each subtype possesses distinct clinical, histological, and molecular features; for instance, steatohepatitic HCC is associated with metabolic dysfunction and shows IL-6/JAK/STAT activation, while clear cell HCCs often have IDH1 mutations and favorable prognosis. The macrotrabecular-massive subtype is linked to poor outcomes and TP53 mutations, whereas scirrhous HCCs express stemness markers and have TSC1/TSC2 mutations. Lymphocyte-rich HCCs are characterized by immune cell infiltration and better prognosis. CTNNB1-mutated HCCs show specific morphological features and may benefit from targeted therapies. Understanding these subtypes and associated molecular alterations is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including potential predictive biomarkers and personalized treatments. Additionally, the identification of patterns like vessels-encapsulating-tumor-clusters offers prognostic implications and may guide therapeutic decisions. Recent molecular studies have enhanced our comprehension of HCC heterogeneity, laying the groundwork for more personalized approaches. Pathologists play a vital role in recognizing these subtypes, aiding in prognosis prediction and treatment planning. Advances in digital pathology and artificial intelligence may further facilitate biomarker research, ultimately improving patient outcomes in HCC management.","Introduction:Glioblastoma patients have a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and systemic immunosuppression that comprise a major barrier to immune checkpoint therapy. Based on the production of endocannabinoids by glioblastomas, we explored involvement of endocannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), encoded by the CNR2 gene, which is predominantly expressed by immune cells, in glioblastoma-related immunosuppression.Materials & Methods:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases was used to correlate enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, as well as CB2Rs, with patient overall survival. Intrastriatal administration of luciferase-expressing, murine GL261 glioblastoma cells was used to establish in in vivo glioblastoma model for characterization of tumor growth and intratumoral immune cell infiltration, as well as provide immune cells for in vitro co-culture experiments. Involvement of CB2Rs was determined by treatment with CB2R agonist (GW405833) or CB2R antagonist (AM630). ELISA, FACS, and immunocytochemistry were used to determine perforin, granzyme B, and surface marker levels.Results:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases showed high expression of CB2R and elevated endocannabinoid production correlated with poorer prognosis, and involved immune-associated pathways. AM630treatment of GL261 glioblastoma-bearing mice induced a potent antitumor response, with survival plateauing at 50% on Day 40, when all control mice (median survival 28 days) and mice treated with GW405833 (median survival 21 days) had died. Luciferase tumor imaging revealed accelerated tumor growth by GW405833 treatment, but stable or regressing tumors in AM630-treated mice. Notably, in spleens, AM630 treatment caused an 83% decrease in monocytes/macrophages, and 1.8- and 1.6-fold increases in CD8+ and CD4+ cells, respectively. Within tumors, there was a corresponding decrease in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increase in CD8+ T cells. In vitro, lymphocytes from AM630-treated mice showed greater cytotoxic function (increased percentage of perforin- and granzyme B-positive CD8+ T cells).Discussion:These results suggest that inhibition of CB2R enhances both immunosuppressive TAM infiltration and systemic T-cell suppression through CB2R activation, and that inhibition of CB2Rs can potently counter both the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, as well as systemic immunosuppression in glioblastoma.",0
"Breast cancer has a high incidence and high heterogeneity among women worldwide, but its lack of highly consistent in vitro research models has limited the translation of experimental results into clinical applications. The emergence of tumor organoids in the new era has aroused great interest among scientists. Organoids possess multi-omics characteristics highly preserved from parental tumors and offer advantages such as long-term and stable passaging and visualization in vitro. Thus, they have overcome multiple defects of two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). However, the lack of inter-organoid homogeneity, vascular-like fluid system and complex microenvironment has affected their wider applications, making it urgent to introduce new approaches for developing a more comprehensive functionality of this model. In recent years, the combination of tumor organoids with other innovative technologies has provided some relevantly important solutions and made it an optimal high-throughput and high-fidelity in vitro model. Here, we provide an overview of the development and optimization of breast cancer organoids, discuss how they have been integrated with several emerging technologies, and further summarize their applications in functional precision oncology. We believe that the intersection of new technologies has great potential in breast cancer translational research, which may finally provide new insights into organoid-guided breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment.","BackgroundTertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) impact cancer outcomes, including in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where their role in immune modulation during neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is underexplored.MethodsThis study employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining, and radiomic techniques to evaluate TLSs and the tumour microenvironment (TME) in TNBC patient samples before and after NAT.ResultsThe presence of TLSs in TNBC was associated with B-cell maturation and T-cell activation. Compared with TLS-low TNBC, TLS-high TNBC showed significantly greater expression of immunoglobulin family genes (IGHM and IGHG1) in B cells and greater cytotoxicity of neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells (neoTCR8). Additionally, mIF revealed notable differences between TLSs and the TME in TNBC. Although CD8 + T-cell levels do not predict the NAT response effectively, TLS maturity strongly correlated with better NAT outcomes and prognosis (P < 0.05). An imaging biomarker scoring system was also developed to predict TLS status and NAT efficacy.ConclusionOur results demonstrated changes in TLSs and the TME in TNBC patients post-NAT. These findings confirm the predictive value of mature TLSs (mTLSs) and support the use of personalised immunotherapy based on post-NAT immune characteristics, thereby improving clinical outcomes.",1

Patterns of recurrence/progression and overall survival were compared using multivariable analyses of the entire cohort and a propensity score-matched cohort.ResultsOf 170 patients included, 119 underwent hepatectomy and 51 received systemic treatment. Surgically treated patients had a more favourable pattern of recurrence with most recurrences limited to a single site, whereas diffuse progression was more common among patients who received systemic treatment (19 versus 44%; P = 0.002). Surgically treated patients had longer median overall survival (35 versus 20 months; P < 0.001). Hepatectomy was independently associated with better OS than systemic treatment alone (HR 0.37, 95% c.i. 0.21 to 0.65). In the propensity score-matched cohort, surgically treated patients had longer median overall survival (28 versus 20 months; P < 0.001); hepatectomy was independently associated with better overall survival (HR 0.47, 0.25 to 0.88).Conclusion BRAF V600E mutation should not be considered a contraindication to surgery for patients with resectable, liver-only CRLMs.",0
"Aging is a complex and universal process marked by gradual functional declines at the cellular and tissue levels, often leading to a range of aging-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Delaying the aging process can help prevent, slow down, and alleviate the severity of these various conditions, enhancing overall health and well-being. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are a class of widely used antidiabetic drugs that inhibit alpha-glucosidase in the small intestinal mucosa, delaying carbohydrate absorption and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. Beyond their roles in diabetes treatment, AGIs have shown potential in extending lifespan and effectively treating aging-related diseases by modulating oxidative stress, gut microbiota, inflammatory responses, and nutrient-sensing pathways. This review summarizes recent advancements in the application of AGIs for preventing and treating aging and aging-related diseases, with a focus on their mechanisms and roles in these processes.","CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily and is specific for CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12, also known as SDF-1), which makes CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. CXCR4 interacts with its ligand, triggering downstream signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation chemotaxis, migration, and gene expression. The interaction also regulates physiological processes, including hematopoiesis, organogenesis, and tissue repair. Multiple evidence revealed that CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is implicated in several pathways involved in carcinogenesis and plays a key role in tumor growth, survival, angiogenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Several CXCR4-targeting compounds have been discovered and used for preclinical and clinical cancer therapy, most of which have shown promising anti-tumor activity. In this review, we summarized the physiological signaling of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and described the role of this axis in tumor progression, and focused on the potential therapeutic options and strategies to block CXCR4.",0
"Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) limits therapeutic effectiveness by interacting with the PD-1 receptor on host immune cells. Targeting the secretion of sEV PD-L1 has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy. However, the lack of small-molecule inhibitors poses a challenge for clinical translation. In this study, we developed a target and phenotype dual-driven high-throughput screening strategy that combined virtual screening with nanoflow-based experimental verification. We identified ibuprofen (IBP) as a novel inhibitor that effectively targeted sEV PD-L1 secretion. IBP disrupted the biogenesis and secretion of PD-L1+ sEVs in tumor cells by physically interacting with a critical regulator of sEV biogenesis, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate. Notably, the mechanism of action of IBP is distinct from its commonly known targets, cyclooxygenases. Administration of IBP stimulated antitumor immunity and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma mouse models. To address potential adverse effects, we further developed an IBP gel for topical application, which demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy when combined with anti-PD-1 treatment. The discovery of this specific small inhibitor provides a promising avenue for establishing durable, systemic antitumor immunity.","AbstractInvasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) of lung is a unique subset of adenocarcinomas characterized by an intrapulmonary aerogenous spread resulting in multicentric, multilobar, and bilateral lesions with a low frequency of distant metastasis. The treatment options for IMA are limited, and advanced IMA has a poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than a year. Lung transplantation performed in a handful of selected patients showed improved survival outcomes and clinical improvement. However, high postoperative recurrence rates have been observed and recurrence appeared to originate from the primary tumor in many cases. Techniques, such as non-sequential double lung transplantation utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass, have been performed to reduce recurrence. Here, we present the first case of bilateral lung transplantation employing cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient with stage ⅣA lung-limited IMA without lymph node or distant metastasis. At 15 months post-transplantation, the patient remains stable with no evidence of disease recurrence or organ rejection. Additionally, we describe the classification, clinical outcomes, protein expression, and genetic characteristics of IMA. IMA was previously classified as a subset of bronchioalveolar carcinoma (BAC), which is invasive and mucinous with goblet or columnar cells secreting mucin. We reviewed and summarized the lung transplantation cases reported to date for BAC. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival have been reported approximately 50% (range, 39-100) and 50% (range, 35–100), respectively. The literature shows these outcomes are comparable to bilateral lung transplantation performed for non-cancerous pulmonary disease.",0
"PurposeThe combination of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors has a good efficacy in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). The multi-target TKI lenvatinib and NGS-guided targeted therapy are also promising in BTC treatment. This study aimed to explore the performance of GemOX plus sintilimab and TKI (either lenvatinib or by NGS-guided targeted therapy) for local advanced or metastatic BTCs.MethodsThis prospective single-arm study included patients with local advanced or metastatic BTCs and applied intravenous infusion of standard GemOX plus sintilimab and lenvatinib (no targetable gene alterations) or targeted therapy based on NGS (olaparib for BRCA1/2 mutation, dasatinib for IDH1/2 mutation, afatinib for EGFR amplification, lenvatinib for PDGFR and KIT mutation, and lenvatinib for FGFR/KIT mutation).ResultsFrom November 2020 to December 2021, 22 patients BTCs (6 GBC, 14 iCCA, 1 pCCA and 1 dCCA cases) were enrolled, with an average age of 58.4 years. Partial response (PR) was achieved in 10 cases, stable disease (SD) in 9 cases and progression disease (PD) in 3 cases (13.6%). The objective response rate (ORR) was 45.5%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 86.4%. During the treatment, the incidence of adverse reactions was 81.8%, and the incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was 9.09%. For 14 patients with NGS, 5 patients were treated by targeted therapy and there were 1 SD and 4 PR cases. For four patients with positive PD-L1 expression, the ORR was 100%. While among the three patients with super-progression markers such as RET, MDM2 and FGF14/STK24, there were two SD and one PD cases.ConclusionIn patients with advanced BTCs, the combination of GemOX plus sintilimab and lenvatinib or NGS-guided targeted therapy showed promising ORR and DCR, especially for the patients with positive PD-L1 expression and targetable gene alterations.","BackgroundQingre huazhuo tang (QRHZT) is a traditional Chinese medicine decoction that has been used clinically by traditional Chinese medicine masters for more than 50 years with good results. However, its mechanism is unknown, and further elucidation is necessary.Aim of the studyTo verify the mechanism by which QRHZT regulates IgA nephropathy through immune checkpoints and ferroptosis by combining network pharmacology, single-cell sequencing and experimental studies.Materials and methodsThe single-cell sequencing data obtained from podocytes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) patients were screened, and the QRHZT target information was obtained from the ETCM database. Moreover, the KEGG, GSEA, immune checkpoint and ferroptosis data were analyzed and plotted using R language. Finally, the relevant immune checkpoint and ferroptosis targets were validated experimentally.ResultsQRHZT can regulate IgAN through the immune checkpoints FIT, FTH1, AKR1C3, and IL6 and the ferroptosis-related genes PVR and IFNG.ConclusionQRHZT has the potential to regulate IgAN, and omics strategies combined with network pharmacology is a feasible method for exploring the mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicines.",0
"Evolving evidence indicates that tumor cells can transdifferentiate between distinct transcriptionally-determined cell states with changes in resultant phenotypes, a phenomenon known as cellular plasticity. These transitions are not driven by genetic mutations and typically in contrast to normal developmental processes, may proceed bidirectionally. Here, we review the role of cellular plasticity in the aggressive childhood solid tumor, neuroblastoma. We discuss the detection of two cell states, termed mesenchymal (MES) and adrenergic (ADRN), their properties and the transcriptional circuitries that control them, their relation to the normal embryogenesis of the sympathetic nervous system and their potential role in drug resistance, escape from therapy and development of relapse.","PurposeNeuroblastoma is a challenging pediatric tumor with a need for improved treatment strategies. This study explores the role of disulfidptosis, a form of cell death induced by intracellular disulfide accumulation, in neuroblastoma and its implications for prognosis and immune infiltration.MethodsWe subgrouped neuroblastoma samples based on disulfidptosis-related gene expression and constructed a disulfidptosis potential index (DPI) to quantify disulfidptosis levels in neurobalstoma. The correlation between DPI, outcome, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity were explored.ResultsCombing RNA-seq and single-cell dataset, we found that higher disulfidptosis potential index (DPI) is associated with poorer outcomes in neuroblastoma patients, indicating the detrimental impact of enhanced disulfide stress and cellular dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that higher DPI is correlated with reduced immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an immunosuppressive milieu in high DPI neuroblastomas. The DPI-high neuroblastoma may benefit from the estrogen pathway related drug fulvestrant.ConclusionOverall, this study highlights the significance of disulfidptosis as a potential therapeutic target and underscores the importance of integrating immune modulation strategies, offering new avenues for improved management of neuroblastoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05392-9.",1
"ABSTRACTAdoptive cell therapy (ACT) is on the horizon as a thrilling therapeutic plan for cancer. However, widespread application of ACT is often restricted by several challenges, including complexity of priming tumor-specific T cells and poor trafficking in solid tumors. The convergence of nanotechnology and cancer immunotherapy is coming of age and could address the limitations of ACT. Recent studies have provided evidence on the application of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to generate smart immune cells and to bypass problems associated with conventional ACT. Herein, we review current progress in the application of MNPs to improve preparing, guiding and tracking immune cells in cancer ACT. Besides, we comment on the challenges ahead and strategies to optimize MNPs for clinical settings.","BackgroundResistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a pervasive barrier in TKIs therapy for EGFR/ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy has exhibited an encouraging anti-tumor activity in high-selected EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to TKI therapy. However, the effect of ICI plus chemotherapy therapy on those with brain metastases in this subset of patients is still unknown.MethodsFrom April 2019 to August 2021, EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who progressed after previous EGFR/ALK-TKIs with brain metastases and received ICI plus chemotherapy ± bevacizumab at Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) were included. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy, toxicity and progression site after ICI treatment.ResultsA total of 19 patients were included in the study, including 16 (84.4%) patients with EGFR mutations, 2 (10.5%) with ALK translocations and 1 (5.3%) with RET rearrangement. All of the patients progressed after previous TKI therapy and had brain metastatic lesions when received ICI combination therapy. The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 15.8 and 57.9%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.7 months (95% confidence interval CI 0.43–8.96) and 19.2 months (95% CI 15.08–23.29), respectively. The intracranial ORR was 10.5% and extracranial ORR was 15.8%, and the intracranial and extracranial DCR were 68.4 and 63.2%, respectively. The most common progression pattern was extracranial failure, and primary lesions enlargement rather than new sites metastases accounted for the vast majority of progressions. The most common grade 3–4 adverse event (AE) was leukopenia (31.6%), followed by neutropenia (26.3%), thrombocytopenia (10.5%) and rash (5.3%) successively. No grade 5 AE and discontinuation of ICI therapy for severe AEs were observed.ConclusionsICI combined with chemotherapy ± bevacizumab might be effective and safe for EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC patients who progressed after previous TKI therapy, and synergistic anti-tumor activity for brain metastases was also observed.",0
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious, progressive, and irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid β-protein (Aβ) to form senile plaques and abnormal phosphorylation of intracellular tau protein to form neuronal fiber tangles. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and there are several hypotheses, primarily including the Aβ cascade hypothesis, the neurofibrillary tangle hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, and the cholinergic hypothesis. It has been suggested that the dysregulation of multiple energy metabolic pathways, especially mitochondria metabolism, may be related to the severity of AD pathology and disease symptoms in the brain. The modification of histone (lysine) methylation, an actively regulated and reversible process, is closely related to energy metabolism and plays a crucial role in AD development. In summary, histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD restricted and regulated each other. Here, we review the advances in the correlation between histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD. This can provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and its control.","BackgroundAbnormal tau proteins are independent contributors to cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, not all individuals exposed to high-level tau pathology will develop cognitive dysfunction. We aimed to construct a model to predict cognitive trajectory for this high-risk population.MethodLongitudinal data of 181 non-demented adults (mean age= 73.1; female= 45%), who were determined to have high cerebral burden of abnormal tau by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of phosphorylated tau (ptau181) or total tau, were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Cognitive decline was defined as Mini-Mental State Examination scores decline ≥ 3 over three years. A predictive nomogram was constructed using stepwise backward regression method. The discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were evaluated. The model was validated in another 189 non-demented adults via a cross-sectional set (n=149, mean age = 73.9, female = 51%) and a longitudinal set (n= 40, mean age = 75, female = 48%). Finally, the relationships of the calculated risk scores with cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's disease were examined during an extended 8-year follow-up.ResultLower volume of hippocampus (odds ratio [OR] = 0.37, p< 0.001), lower levels of CSF sTREM2 (OR = 0.76, p = 0.003), higher scores of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (OR = 1.15, p = 0.001) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (OR = 1.16, p = 0.016), and number of APOE ε4 (OR = 1.88, p = 0.039) were associated with higher risk of cognitive decline independent of the amyloid status and were included in the final model. The nomogram had an area of under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 for training set, 0.93 for cross-sectional validation set, and 0.91 for longitudinal validation set. Over the 8-year follow-up, the high-risk group exhibited faster cognitive decline (p< 0.001) and a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia (HR= 6.21, 95% CI= 3.61–10.66, p< 0.001).ConclusionAPOE ε4 status, brain reserve capability, neuroinflammatory marker, and neuropsychological scores can help predict cognitive decline in non-demented adults with high burden of tau pathology, independent of the presence of amyloid pathology.",1
"ABSTRACTBiliary tract cancers are a rare diagnosis with a rising incidence. Up to 20% of patients have peritoneal metastases, resulting in symptoms of ascites, abdominal pain and potential bowel obstruction. A standard of care systemic treatment comprises gemcitabine, cisplatin and durvalumab (gem/cis/durva). However, the clinical benefit among patients with peritoneal metastases remains unknown. Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy (PIPAC) delivers chemotherapy directly to the peritoneal space, which could potentially improve efficacy with minimal systemic toxicity. We describe the design of a Phase I study investigating PIPAC with nab-paclitaxel plus systemic gem/cis/durva among biliary tract cancer patients with peritoneal metastases who have not received prior systemic treatment. The primary end point is safety of PIPAC with nab-paclitaxel in combination with systemic gem/cis/durva.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05285358 (ClinicalTrials.gov)","With the development of antitumor therapies, different treatment methods including monotherapy and combined therapy have achieved clinical efficacy in advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

However, potential distinct mechanisms are found from several dimensions including molecular structures, biological behaviors, concomitant mutations, resistance mechanisms and tumor mutation burdens. More evidence indicates the prognostic difference of EGFR subgroups. This review focused on the progress of potential distinct mechanisms and outcomes in clinical trials of advanced NSCLC patients with ex19del or exon 21 L858R mutation.",0
"AbstractBackground:Neoadjuvant therapy enhances the possibility of achieving radical resection and improves the prognosis for locally advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal extent of resection for locally advanced proximal GC after neoadjuvant therapy.Methods:In this study, 330 patients underwent resection in Peking University Cancer Hospital, with curative intent after neoadjuvant therapy for histologically confirmed proximal GC from January 2009 to December 2022.Results:In this study, 45 patients underwent proximal gastrectomy (PG), while 285 underwent total gastrectomy (TG). After propensity-score matching, 110 patients (71 TG and 39 PG) were included in the analysis. No significant differences between PG and TG regarding short-term outcomes and long-term prognosis were found. Specifically, PG demonstrated comparable overall survival to TG (P = 0.47). Subgroup analysis revealed that although not statistically significant, PG showed a potential advantage over TG in overall survival for patients with tumor-long diameters less than 4 cm (P = 0.31). However, for those with a long diameter larger than 4 cm, TG had a better survival probability (P = 0.81). No substantial differences were observed in baseline characteristics, surgical safety, postoperative recovery, and postoperative complications.Conclusion:For locally advanced proximal GC with objective response to neoadjuvant therapy (long diameter <4 cm), PG is an alternative surgical procedure.","PurposeMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory molecules capable of positively or negatively regulating signaling pathways, and are involved in tumorigenesis as well as various aspects of cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression levels of miR-133a, miR-637, and miR-944 in serum and tumor tissues as well as their relationship with the expression level of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase-B (AKT) genes and proteins along with their clinical significance in breast cancer. MethodsThe expressions of miR-133a, miR-637, miR-944, PI3K, and AKT genes were examined in the tumor and tumor margin tissues of 40 patients with breast cancer, as well as the serum levels of miR-133a, miR-637, and miR-944 in these patients and 40 healthy groups by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). PI3K and AKT proteins expression in tumor and tumor margin tissues were detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC).ResultsThe expression levels of miR-133a and miR-637 in the tumor tissue and serum of patients were lower than those in the tumor margin tissue and serum of the healthy group, respectively. In addition, the expression level of miR-944 in the tumor tissue was lower than that in the tumor margin tissue, but its expression increased in the serum of cancer patients compared to that in the healthy group. The expression of miR-637 was correlated with tumor location and Her2 receptors, and the expression of miR-944 was correlated with tumor location and family history. PI3K and AKT mRNA and protein levels were higher in the tumor tissues than in the tumor margin tissues (p < 0.05).ConclusionThe results of our study revealed that miR-637 has a better diagnostic value in breast cancer than miR-133a and miR-944.",0
"Imaging plays a pivotal role in the precise diagnosis of a variety of diseases. Various imaging modalities have long secured their place in clinics. However, a lot of these techniques come with their own set of secondary complications and side effects, like ionization radiation in X-rays or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Unlike those, magnetically guided imaging modalities have an advantage as they do not pose any critical hazard to the body tissues while operating within acceptable thresholds. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been thoroughly investigated as a versatile platform as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nanotracers for magnetic particle imaging (MPI), due to their unique physical properties (that is, super-paramagnetism) at nanoscale dimensions, and ability to function at the molecular level in biological interactions. Based on the underlying mechanism of these techniques, various parameters like shape, size, anisotropy, magnetization, and surface chemistry, become deciding factors in enhancing the performances of MNPs. Focusing on magnetically guided biomedical imaging, this review discusses the fundamental principles of MRI and MPI and their nanoscale imaging agents. This review also summarizes the existing strategies to enhance the performances and significance of MNPs, and new advances in updating current clinical diagnostics and precision nanomedicine.","ABSTRACTHS-1793 is a novel derivative of resveratrol, a compound known for its numerous beneficial effects, including anticancer activity, anti-inflammatory response, antimicrobial, antiaging, anti-cardiovascular disease activity, neuroprotective activity, etc. Despite its wide and interesting properties, resveratrol suffers from a crucial flaw because it is low bioavailable. For this reason, many other derivatives were explored and among them, HS-1793 has caught the attention of researchers. HS-1793 is a synthetic derivative of resveratrol discovered in 2007 that has been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the compound showed a positive profile in metabolic processes, with adequate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

"Shotgun microbiome sequencing analysis presents several challenges to accurately and consistently depict sample composition and functional potential. Here we present a two-part framework – JAMS (Just a Microbiology System) – whereby with raw fastq files and metadata as input, meaningful analysis within a sample and between a sample can be performed with ease for either shotgun or 16S sequences. JAMS is the first package to provide seamless deconvolution of functions into their taxonomic contributors.

"A larger percentage of our population is aging healthily and living on to a ripe old age. 60 years of age is taken as cut-off for identifying geriatric population for the purpose of specialized healthcare. The incidence of cancer is increasing and its expected more so in the geriatric population. At present , there are a limited cancer centres where specialized geriatric clinic is being conducted.Some of the the key unmet needs are — lack of resources and time for dedicated geriatric screening, lack of validated interventions and lack of awareness about the field of geriatric oncology. Some of the proposed solutions are increasing orientation and exposure of trainees and early career oncologists as well as carrying out country specific research to find useful interventions in this field.","Aging is a complex and universal process marked by gradual functional declines at the cellular and tissue levels, often leading to a range of aging-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Delaying the aging process can help prevent, slow down, and alleviate the severity of these various conditions, enhancing overall health and well-being. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are a class of widely used antidiabetic drugs that inhibit alpha-glucosidase in the small intestinal mucosa, delaying carbohydrate absorption and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. Beyond their roles in diabetes treatment, AGIs have shown potential in extending lifespan and effectively treating aging-related diseases by modulating oxidative stress, gut microbiota, inflammatory responses, and nutrient-sensing pathways. This review summarizes recent advancements in the application of AGIs for preventing and treating aging and aging-related diseases, with a focus on their mechanisms and roles in these processes.",1
"Rationale:Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a successful treatment for B-cell malignancies associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Cardiovascular toxicities have also been reported in this setting. However, there is scarce data regarding development of autonomic disorders after CAR-T cell therapy.Patient concerns:We report a case with a patient with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, refractory to 2 prior lines of immunochemotherapy, treated with CAR-T therapy.Diagnoses:Orthostatic hypotension secondary to autonomic dysfunction was diagnosed as manifestation of ICANS.Interventions:The patient received metilprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily for 3 days and anakinra 100 mg IV every 6h.Outcomes:The vast majority of autonomic symptoms ceased and 4 months after CAR-T therapy, autonomic dysfunction was resolved.Lessons:New-onset autonomic dysfunction can occur as manifestation of ICANS in patients who experience persistent neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms after resolution of acute neurotoxicity and should be early recognized. Differences in differential diagnosis, mechanisms and treatment approaches are discussed.","With expansion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and broader utilization of anti-cytokine directed therapeutics for toxicity mitigation, the routine assessment of cytokines may enhance understanding of toxicity profiles, guide therapeutic interventions, and facilitate cross-trial comparisons. As specific cytokine elevations can correlate with and provide insights into CAR T cell toxicity, mitigation strategies, and response, we explored the reporting of cytokine detection methods and assessed for the correlation of cytokines to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) across clinical trials. In this analysis, we reviewed 21 clinical trials across 60 manuscripts that featured a US Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR T cell construct or one of its predecessors. We highlight substantial variability and limited reporting of cytokine measurement platforms and panels used across CAR T cell clinical trials. Specifically, across 60 publications, 28 (46.7%) did not report any cytokine data, representing 6 of 21 (28.6%) clinical trials. In the 15 trials reporting cytokine data, at least 4 different platforms were used. Furthermore, correlation of cytokines with ICANS, CRS, and CRS severity was limited. Considering the fundamental role of cytokines in CAR T cell toxicity, our manuscript supports the need to establish standardization of cytokine measurements as a key biomarker essential to improving outcomes of CAR T cell therapy.",1
"BackgroundCutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) has the worst prognosis among skin cancers, especially metastatic CMM. Predicting its prognosis accurately could direct clinical decisions.MethodsThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was screened to collect CMM patients’ data. According to diagnosed time, patients were subdivided into three cohorts, train cohort (diagnosed between 2010 and 2013), validation cohort (diagnosed in 2014), and test cohort (diagnosed in 2015). Train cohort was used to train deep learning survival model for cutaneous malignant melanoma (DeepCMM). DeepCMM was then evaluated in train cohort and validation cohort internally, and validated in test cohort externally.ResultsDeepCMM showed 0.8270 (95% CI, confidence interval, CI 0.8260–0.8280) as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in train cohort, 0.8274 (95% CI 0.8286–0.8298) AUC in validation cohort, and 0.8303 (95% CI 0.8289–0.8316) AUC in test cohort. Then DeepCMM was packaged into a Windows 64-bit software for doctors to use.ConclusionDeep learning survival model for cutaneous malignant melanoma (DeepCMM) can offer a reliable prediction on cutaneous malignant melanoma patients’ overall survival.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05421-7.","The P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated ion channel which belongs to the P2X receptor family, plays critical roles in recognizing extracellular adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) and is widely expressed in most tumor cells as well as inflammatory cells. Previously, the P2X7 receptor has been demonstrated to modulate the progression of various malignancies, including glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. However, the biological function and prognostic values of P2X7 receptor in hepatocellular carcinoma remain to be determined. Here, we investigated the expression level of P2X7 receptor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Then MTS and EdU assays were carried out to study the role of P2X7 receptor blockade in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, the underlying mechanism was further elucidated by bulk RNAseq. Compared to the control group, the P2X7 receptor was significantly up-regulated in the hepatocellular carcinoma group. Interestingly, A740003 and A438079, two selective antagonists at P2X7 receptor, significantly blocked Ca2+ influx and decreased the proliferative rate of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the expression level of chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CHSY1), an enzyme that mediates the polymerization step of chondroitin sulfate, was reduced by both A740003 and A438079. In conclusion, inhibition of the P2X7 receptor attenuated the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and this process was largely modulated by CHSY1. Thus, our findings reveal a previously unknown role for P2X7 receptor in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and imply that the P2X7 receptor may represent a new target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11302-024-10064-5.",0
"BackgroundTrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells and many malignant tumor cells. However, data on TROP2 expression in advanced lung cancer are insufficient, and its changes have not been fully evaluated.MethodsWe assessed the prevalence and changes in TROP2 expression in patients with lung cancer who received anti-cancer treatments using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with an anti-TROP2 antibody (clone: SP295). IHC scores were graded from 0 to 3; grade ≥ 2 was considered positive for TROP2 expression. We defined a difference in IHC score, before and after anti-cancer treatments, as the change in TROP2 expression.ResultsBefore anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 89% (143/160) of the patients and was significantly more common in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma than in neuroendocrine carcinoma (P < 0.001). After anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 87% (139/160) of the patients. The distribution of TROP2 expression in post-treatment samples was analogous to that in pre-treatment samples when compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P = 0.509). However, an increase in TROP2 expression was seen in 19 (12%), and a decrease in 20 (13%) patients. Patients treated with targeted therapy showed significantly higher changes in TROP2 expression (P = 0.019) and thoracic radiotherapy was more likely to increase TROP2 expression than chemotherapy alone.ConclusionAlthough some anti-cancer treatments might alter the TROP2 expression, TROP2 was expressed in most lung cancer specimens before and after anti-cancer treatments. These results support the development of TROP2-directed therapy against advanced lung cancer in various treatment lines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03784-3.","Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant disease in the world which has a profound effect on human health and life quality.

"AbstractBackgroundGuidelines for the management of patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP), who have metastatic disease without an identified primary tumor site, have evolved. We sought to describe the diagnostic work-up and outcomes of patients with CUP in Canada over the last decade. We also sought to identify factors associated with improved prognosis in CUP, including primary tumor site identification, identification of “favorable subtypes,” and concordance with published guidelines.MethodsWith ethics board approval, patients with histologically confirmed CUP between 2012 and 2021 in 3 Canadian cancer centers were reviewed and clinicopathological variables retrospectively collected. The primary endpoint was to describe significant trends in CUP diagnosis and management over the decade using linear regression models. Univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) logistic regression analyses identified variables correlated with primary site identification and overall survival (OS). Kaplan–Meier curves with the log-rank test were used to compare OS outcomes.ResultsIn total, 907 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 5.1 months. There was an increase in both 5-year survival and identification of primary tumors over the decade. Diagnostic tests including next-generation sequencing were independently associated with primary site identification on UVA. However, primary site identification was not found to be predictive of survival; instead, patients with “favorable subtypes” of CUP had significantly longer OS.ConclusionsSurvival in patients with CUP in Canada has been increasing over the last decade. Identifying the primary site does not influence survival, and efforts should be focused on discovering novel “favorable subtypes” which have superior outcomes.","Increasing evidence indicates that Calumenin (CALU), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is significantly associated with tumor progression. However, the effect of CALU on patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unknown. By integrating multi-omics data and molecular biology experiments, we found that CALU expression was significantly increased in tumors compared with normal tissues, and the pathological grade and prognosis of patients were correlated with CALU expression. Next, knockdown or ectopic expression of CALU could affect the proliferative and invasive abilities of ccRCC cells. Moreover, immune landscape characterization revealed that CALU expression was positively associated with neutrophils and macrophages, whereas it was negatively associated with natural killer T cells and CD8+ T cells. Single-cell sequencing showed that the localization and binding targets of CALU mainly involved monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Sensitivity analysis of common chemotherapeutic drugs showed that high expression of CALU could sensitize chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol, AMG-706 and Cytarabine, but could lead to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as Embelin, Salubrinal and Tipifarnib. We demonstrated a significant correlation between high CALU expression and poor patient survival. Further, we demonstrated a correlation between CALU expression, tumor microenvironment, and the sensitivity of patients to common chemo- and immuno-therapy drugs. Thus, our results indicate that CALU could be a biomarker and designing personalized treatment approaches for ccRCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00169-7.",0

First, we investigated the tumor-suppressive effect of cordycepin on the regulation of biological functions in murine colorectal cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, we evaluated the in vivo antitumor potential of cordycepin using a mouse preclinical tumor model, and further explored the antitumor mechanism.ResultsOur findings revealed that cordycepin effectively inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of murine colon cancer cells. Moreover, there is a substantial reduction in the expression of PD-L1 observed in tumor cells, in response to cordycepin treatment. Collectively, these results demonstrate the significant tumor-suppressive attributes of cordycepin against colorectal cancer. Consequently, our study lays a solid foundation for the potential clinical utilization of cordycepin in cancer therapy.ConclusionCordycepin inhibits the biological functions of colorectal cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth by reducing the expression of PD-L1.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05460-0.","BackgroundAlthough neoadjuvant immunotherapy is being widely studied, there is no consensus on its efficacy in microsatellite-stable (MSS) or mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate studies on neoadjuvant immunotherapy for advanced CRC to assess its efficacy and provide new clinical guidelines.MethodsWe searched literature databases to identify studies that assessed the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced CRC. The outcomes evaluated were pathological complete response (pCR), major pathological response (MPR), R0 resection, and anal preservation rates. Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed by sensitivity analysis, and publication bias was evaluated using Begg and Egger tests.ResultsEleven articles were included in the analysis. The pCR, MPR, R0 resection, and anal preservation rates reported in these studies were 39 and 49, 97, and 76%, respectively. The MSI-H and MSS groups had pooled pCR rates of 70 and 24%, respectively. The pCR rates for the induction, consolidation, and concurrent immuno-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) subgroups were 43, 33, and 27%, respectively, and those for the single and double immunotherapy subgroups were 34 and 40%, respectively.ConclusionNeoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with CRT is effective in treating MSI-H/dMMR advanced CRC. It could also be a new first-line therapeutic option for MSS/pMMR advanced CRC.",1
"AbstractMost patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have limited treatment options following standard-of-care therapy. VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05425940 (ClinicalTrials.gov)","Actionable mutations of RET kinase have been identified as oncogenic drivers of solid tumors, including thyroid cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and nonsmall cell lung cancer. Although multikinase inhibitors and RET selective inhibitors are used to treat patients with RET alterations, there is insufficient research addressing certain issues: which actionable mutations arise from these therapies, how to improve the clinical response rate to RET inhibitors, and how to design new inhibitors to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, the development of sophisticated tool compounds is required to investigate the molecular mechanisms of actionable mutations and to develop breakthrough therapeutics for different RET alterations. Herein, we present our investigation into the side chains of imidazopyridazine hinge binders that are capable of inducing protein–ligand interaction patterns from the gatekeeper to the waterfront regions. Extending the substituents at the second and sixth positions enhanced the IC50 up to < 0.5 nM for diverse RET alterations.",1
"Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer management, but many tumors, particularly immunologically “cold” tumors, remain resistant. Combination of conventional systemic immunotherapies with locoregional interventional radiology approaches is being explored to transform these “cold” tumors into immunologically active “hot” ones. The present article uses the example of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC), a renal cell carcinoma subtype resistant to current systemic immunotherapies, to address practical and conceptual challenges that have to date prevented the activation of clinical trials specifically designed for this malignancy. The practical framework discussed herein can help overcome logistical and funding limitations and facilitate the development of biology-informed clinical trials tailored to specific rare diseases such as ChRCC.","Purpose:This study aimed to compare accuracy and efficiency of a convolutional neural network (CNN)–enhanced workflow for pancreas segmentation versus radiologists in the context of interreader reliability.Methods:Volumetric pancreas segmentations on a data set of 294 portal venous computed tomographies were performed by 3 radiologists (R1, R2, and R3) and by a CNN. Convolutional neural network segmentations were reviewed and, if needed, corrected (“corrected CNN [c-CNN]” segmentations) by radiologists. Ground truth was obtained from radiologists’ manual segmentations using simultaneous truth and performance level estimation algorithm. Interreader reliability and model’s accuracy were evaluated with Dice-Sorenson coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard coefficient (JC). Equivalence was determined using a two 1-sided test. Convolutional neural network segmentations below the 25th percentile DSC were reviewed to evaluate segmentation errors. Time for manual segmentation and c-CNN was compared.Results:Pancreas volumes from 3 sets of segmentations (manual, CNN, and c-CNN) were noninferior to simultaneous truth and performance level estimation–derived volumes [76.6 cm3 (20.2 cm3), P < 0.05]. Interreader reliability was high (mean [SD] DSC between R2-R1, 0.87 [0.04]; R3-R1, 0.90 [0.05]; R2-R3, 0.87 [0.04]). Convolutional neural network segmentations were highly accurate (DSC, 0.88 [0.05]; JC, 0.79 [0.07]) and required minimal-to-no corrections (c-CNN: DSC, 0.89 [0.04]; JC, 0.81 [0.06]; equivalence, P < 0.05). Undersegmentation (n = 47 [64%]) was common in the 73 CNN segmentations below 25th percentile DSC, but there were no major errors. Total inference time (minutes) for CNN was 1.2 (0.3). Average time (minutes) taken by radiologists for c-CNN (0.6 [0.97]) was substantially lower compared with manual segmentation (3.37 [1.47]; savings of 77.9%–87% [P < 0.0001]).Conclusions:Convolutional neural network–enhanced workflow provides high accuracy and efficiency for volumetric pancreas segmentation on computed tomography.",0
"PurposeCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common and debilitating long-term side effect of cancer and its treatment. While exercise has been shown to effectively reduce CRF, the underlying mechanisms are not fully clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of a 4-month walking exercise program on fatigue severity and to explore potential underlying physiological, behavioral, and psychological mechanisms of action.MethodsWe included 27 cancer survivors (59 ± 15 years, 37% female) with variable cancer diagnoses who were at least moderately fatigued and finished treatment between 6 and 36 months ago. This study with a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series design compared a 4-month walking intervention period with a 4-month control period. Measurements of fatigue and physiological, behavioral, and psychological factors were performed, supplemented with participants’ perceptions on how exercise influenced their fatigue.ResultsA significant and clinically relevant decrease in fatigue severity was found over time (β = − 8.1, 95% CI = − 12.1; − 4.2), but could not be attributed directly to the walking exercise intervention. Increases in muscle strength (β = − 0.07, 95% CI = − 0.12; − 0.02), physical activity (β = − 0.1, 95% CI = − 0.2; − 0.04), and sleep quality (β = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.3; 1.9), as well as decreases in muscle relaxation times (β = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.02; 0.16) and psychological distress (β = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.8; 1.3) were associated with reductions in fatigue severity. Resilience and physical well-being were perceived as most important constructs explaining the walking exercise effects on fatigue.ConclusionOur findings reveal potential physiological, behavioral, and psychological mechanisms underlying the multidimensional effects of exercise on fatigue severity.Implications for Cancer Survivors.Incorporating resistance exercise and addressing resilience and physical well-being might improve the efficacy of exercise interventions for cancer survivors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11764-024-01537-y.","PurposeCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a devastating complication with limited recognized clinical risk factors. We examined characteristics among solid and liquid cancers utilizing Machine learning (ML) approaches for predicting CRF.MethodsWe utilized 2017 National Inpatient Sample database and employed generalized linear models to assess the association between CRF and the outcome of burden of illness among hospitalized solid and non-solid tumors patients. And further applied lasso, ridge and Random Forest (RF) for building our linear and non-linear ML models.ResultsThe 2017 database included 196,330 prostate (PCa), 66,385 leukemia (Leuk), 107,245 multiple myeloma (MM), and 41,185 cancers of lip, oral cavity and pharynx (CLOP) patients, and among them, there were 225, 140, 125 and 115 CRF patients, respectively. CRF was associated with a higher burden of illness among Leuk and MM, and higher mortality among PCa. For the PCa patients, both the test and the training data had best areas under the ROC curve [AUC = 0.91 (test) vs. 0.90 (train)] for both lasso and ridge ML. For the CLOP, this was 0.86 and 0.79 for ridge; 0.87 and 0.84 for lasso; 0.82 for both test and train for RF and for the Leuk cohort, 0.81 (test) and 0.76 (train) for both ridge and lasso.ConclusionThis study provided an effective platform to assess potential risks and outcomes of CRF in patients hospitalized for the management of solid and non-solid tumors. Our study showed ML methods performed well in predicting the CRF among solid and liquid tumors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05197-w.",1
"G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, comprised of α and βγ subunits, to convert extracellular signals into activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Canonically, GPCR-mediated activation results in the exchange of GDP for GTP on G protein α subunits (Gα) and the dissociation of Gα-GTP and G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ), both of which can regulate a variety of signaling pathways. Hydrolysis of bound GTP by Gα returns the protein to Gα-GDP and allows reassociation with Gβγ to reform the inactive heterotrimer. Naturally occurring mutations in Gα have been found at conserved glutamine and arginine amino acids that disrupt the canonical G protein cycle by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis, rendering these mutants constitutively active. Interestingly, these dysregulated Gα mutants are found in many different cancers due to their ability to sustain aberrant signaling without a need for activation by GPCRs. This review will highlight an increased recognition of the prevalence of such constitutively activating Gα mutations in cancers and the signaling pathways activated. In addition, we will discuss new knowledge regarding how these constitutively active Gα are regulated, how different mutations are biochemically distinct, and how mutationally activated Gα are unique compared with GPCR-activated Gα. Lastly, we will discuss recent progress in developing inhibitors directly targeting constitutively active Gα mutants.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTConstitutively activating mutations in G protein α subunits (Gα) widely occur in and contribute to the development of many human cancers. To develop ways to inhibit dysregulated, oncogenic signaling by these mutant Gα, it is crucial to better understand mechanisms that lead to constitutive Gα activation and unique mechanisms that regulate mutationally activated Gα in cells. The prevalence of activating mutations in Gα in various cancers makes Gα proteins compelling targets for the development of therapeutics.","PurposeOur study intended to explore the correlation between HER2 alterations and 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and their prognostic value in EGFR-negative non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS).MethodsNGS assay was performed in 1737 NSCLC patients, a total of 88 HER2 alterations and 176 negative HER2 with EGFR-negative patients were randomly selected for this study.ResultsWhen the HER2 status with EGFR-negative group was analyzed, multivariate analysis showed that smoking status, primary tumor SUVmax (pSUVmax) < 13.03 and stage were the independent deterministic factors of HER2 alterations. Multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that HER2 status, age, smoking status and stage were independent risk factors for overall survival (OS) in EGFR-negative NSCLC patients with different HER2 status. When the HER2 alterations group was separately analyzed, multivariate analysis demonstrated that low pSUVmax < 15.32 and histology were the independent deterministic factors of HER2 mutation. Multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that pSUVmax, smoking status, nodal involvement and treatment methods were independent risk factors for OS in EGFR-negative NSCLC patients with HER2 alterations.ConclusionThe study revealed that low pSUVmax was associated with HER2 alterations in EGFR-negative NSCLC patients, moreover HER2 mutation and HER2 amplification exhibited distinct 18F-FDG metabolic and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, it explored the prognostic value of HER2 alterations and 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters of pSUVmax in EGFR-negative NSCLC patients.",0
"Although major progress has been made in the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for hematological malignancies, this method is ineffective against solid tumors largely because of the limited infiltration, activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells. To overcome this issue, we engineered CAR-T cells with synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors, which induce local tumor-specific secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading enzymes at the tumor site. SynNotch CAR-T cells achieve precise ECM recognition and robustly kill targeted tumors, with synNotch-induced enzyme production enabling the degradation of components of the tumor ECM. In addition, this regulation strongly increased the infiltration of CAR-T cells and the clearance of solid tumors, resulting in tumor regression without toxicity in vivo. Notably, synNotch CAR-T cells also promoted the persistent activation of CAR-T cells in patient-derived tumor organoids. Thus, we constructed a synthetic T-cell system that increases the infiltration and antitumor function of CAR-T cells, providing a strategy for targeting ECM-rich solid tumors.","BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is characterized by abnormally fibrotic mesenchyme, which notably influences on the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Low-dose arsenic trioxide (ATO, 1.0 μM) can inhibit the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and affect fibrosis, which is a potential strategy for enhancing the sensitivity to immunotherapy.MethodsExtracellular matrix (ECM) models were employed to assess the regulatory effects of ATO on ECM and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Orthotopic C57BL/6J models were utilized to evaluate the influence of ATO on CD8+T cell infiltration and immunotherapy in PC. Additionally, nanomaterials loaded with ATO designed to specifically target PSCs (scAbFAP-α-HMSNs-PAA-ATO) were produced to enhance targeting effects of ATO.ResultsLow-dose ATO (1.0 μM) suppressed PSCs activation, exhibiting potential for synergistic immunotherapy. Under low-dose ATO intervention, ECM underwent remodeling, leading to increases in CD8+T cell infiltration, thereby enhancing anti-PD-L1 therapy effect. We further demonstrated that low-dose ATO remodeled ECM by regulating the expression of LOXL3 in PSCs. scAbFAP-α-HMSNs-PAA-ATO exhibited improved targeting capabilities, and enhanced capacity to inhibit fibrosis and sensitize immunotherapy.ConclusionsOur research reveals that low-dose ATO, by regulating LOXL3, remodels the ECM and enhances CD8+T cell infiltration, thus sensitizing the efficacy of immunotherapy, which provides a novel strategy for comprehensive treatment to PC.",1
"Copper is an essential element for critical cellular functions such as mitochondrial respiration, cholesterol biosynthesis and immune response. Altered copper homeostasis has been associated with various disorders, including cancer. The copper overload is known to contribute to tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis, and recently it has been suggested that the elevated level of this element may also create vulnerability to a novel cell death mechanism, named cuproptosis. Excessive amount of copper in mitochondria binds to lipoylated enzymes of the TCA cycle and forms insoluble oligomers. The aggregation of these oligomers and subsequent iron–sulfur cluster protein loss results in proteotoxic stress and eventual cell death. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common malignancy with a low survival rate, despite the available treatment options. The discovery of cuproptosis led many researchers to explore its potential use in hepatocellular cancer therapy due to the rich mitochondria content of hepatic cells. In this regard, a number of genomic studies were conducted to discover several cuproptosis-related genes and explored their association with prognosis, survival and immunotherapy response. This review brings together the available data on the relationship between cuproptosis and hepatocellular cancer for the first time, and highlights some of the potential biomarkers or target molecules that may be useful in the treatment.","BackgroundDNA-directed RNA polymerase (DDRP) related genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the development of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Therefore, we aimed to construct a DDRP-associated lncRNA model to predict the prognosis of LUAD and to evaluate its sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy.MethodsTo construct a predictive signature, we used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, as well as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. The prognostic model was verified by applying the ROC curve analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis, GO/KEGG analysis, and a predictive nomogram. Eventually, immunotherapy and drug susceptibility were examined and stemness indices were analyzed.Results24 DDRP-associated lncRNAs were found as independent prognosis factors, which may be further developed as potential therapeutic vaccines for LUAD. The area under the ROC curve and the conformance index showed that the constructed model can predict the prognosis of LUAD patients. The predicted incidences of overall survival showed perfect conformance. And there were significant changes in immunological markers between the two risk subgroups in the model. Finally, an analysis of 50% maximum inhibitory concentration between the two risk subgroups showed that the high-risk subgroup was more sensitive to certain chemotherapy drugs.ConclusionWe constructed a model that accurately predicts the outcomes of LUAD based on 24 DDRP-related lncRNAs and provided promising treatment options for the future.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05118-x.",1
"Objective.To evaluate MR features and clinical course of malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumor (MMNST), previously known as melanotic schwannoma and considered indolent and rarely metastasizing.Materials and Methods.This IRB-approved retrospective study searched 31 patients (20 male : 11 female, mean age 48; range 15–76) with histologically confirmed MMNST in a single tertiary cancer center over 22 years. Pre-treatment MR was available in 12 patients and evaluated by two radiologists in consensus regarding lesion location, size, morphology, signal characteristics, contrast enhancement, local invasion, and presence of classic signs of peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Clinical outcomes, including local recurrence, metastasis and survival, were examined in 12 patients for whom follow-up was available.Results.The spine was the most frequent site (13/31) amongst all identified cases. In 12 cases with MR, lesions were well-circumscribed in 11/12 cases, with a mean size of 4.5 cm (2.3–13.0 cm). Ten of 12 cases showed T1 hyperintensity. In 5/9 spinal MRI, tumor involved multiple levels. All lesions showed contrast enhancement, and local bone invasion in >50%. A dumb-bell shape was common to all spinal lesions. Classical signs of nerve sheath tumors were uncommon. Amongst 12 patients with a mean follow-up of 4.8 years (range 1.3–10.2 years), six were disease-free, while two had recurrence or metastases, and four had died of metastases.Conclusion.MMNST usually presents as a T1 hyperintense enhancing dumb-bell shaped mass in the spine. Multi-level involvement and bone invasion are common. MMNST is clinically aggressive with high rates of metastases and death.","AbstractIntroductionImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are fundamental in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Considering previous reports implied varied responses among patient subgroups, such as patients with different hepatitis etiologies, we planned this meta-analysis to identify specific populations that might derive greater survival benefits from ICIs as a first-line treatment.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed and the Cochrane Library for phase III clinical trials comparing ICIs and multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) as first-line therapies for advanced HCC. We extracted and synthesized hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival across different patient subgroups mainly using the random-effect model.ResultsOur analysis included nine phase III trials involving ICIs, either alone or in combination with other treatments, compared with MKIs. The synthesized HRs for patients with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and nonviral etiologies were 0.74, 0.77, and 0.86, respectively, showing no significant differences (p = 0.13). Such finding remained when we only analyzed clinical trials with positive results. HRs consistently favored ICIs across various demographics such as age, sex, geographic region, performance status, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and disease stage or extent. Notably, patients with extrahepatic spread showed a trend toward better outcomes (HR 0.73) compared to those without (HR 0.85, p = 0.07).ConclusionThe efficacy of ICIs as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC was consistent across diverse patient subgroups, regardless of hepatitis etiology or other demographic factors. These findings do not support using these characteristics to determine the use of ICI therapy in advanced HCC.",0
"AbstractCentral to immune recognition is the glycocalyx, a glycan-rich coat on all cells that plays a crucial role in interactions that enable pathogen detection and activation of immune defenses. Pathogens and cancerous cells often display distinct glycans on their surfaces, making these saccharide antigens prime targets for vaccine development. However, carbohydrates alone generally serve as poor immunogens due to their often weak binding affinities, inability to effectively recruit T cell help, and reliance on adjuvants to iboost immune activation. The introduction of glycoconjugate vaccines, initially involving the covalent coupling of carbohydrate antigens to carrier proteins, marked a pivotal advancement by facilitating neutralizing antibody production against carbohydrate targets. Despite successes in generating glycoconjugate vaccines against certain bacterial diseases, challenges persist in creating effective vaccines against numerous intracellular pathogens and non-communicable diseases such as cancer. In this review, we highlight new developments in conjugate vaccine platforms aim to overcome these limitations by optimizing the display of glycan and T cell epitopes as well as incorporating defined carbohydrate adjuvants to direct tailored immune responses. These advancements promise to improve the effectiveness of carbohydrate-based vaccines and broaden their coverage against a wide range of diseases.","ABSTRACTD2 surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy has been established as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer in Asian countries.

"IntroductionThe regulatory role of miR-182 in breast cancer malignancy and macrophage reprogramming is well established. However, the mechanisms through which miR-182 overexpression in tumor cells influences macrophage polarization remain elusive.Material and methodsAfter transfection with miR-182-5p mimics, inhibitors, and controls for 24 h, exosomes were extracted by differential centrifugation from transfected MDA-MB-231. Macrophages were co-cultured with these exosomes to illustrate the regulative effects of exo-miR-182-5p reprogram macrophage. Furthermore, breast cancer cells were co-cultured with exo-miR-182-5p reprogrammed M2 macrophages to demonstrate the effects of reprogrammed M2 macrophages to influence breast cancer progression. After all, these findings were validated in a cell-derived xenograft (CDX) BALB/C nude-mouse model.ResultsThis study demonstrated that exosome-derived miR-182-5p from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells reprograms M2 macrophage polarization through direct combination with Notch1, thereby enhancing breast cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. When co-cultured with exosomes from TNBC cells transfected with miR-182-5p mimics or inhibitors, macrophages showed altered Notch1/Hes1 pathway expression, leading to M2 polarization and subsequent changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation, and other biochemical markers. Furthermore, breast cancer cells co-cultured with exosome-reprogrammed macrophages exhibited increased colony formation, migration, and invasion, as well as reduced apoptosis. These findings were validated in a BALB/C nude-mouse model.ConclusionsThis study pioneers the elucidation of the feedback loop mechanism between breast cancer cells and macrophages mediated by the exosome-derived miR-182-5p/Notch1 pathway, highlighting its role in macrophage reprogramming. Although the therapeutic application of miR-182-5p inhibitors as anticancer agents remains in the early stages, targeting macrophage polarization represents a promising avenue for breast cancer therapy.","CLIC5 encoded protein associates with actin-based cytoskeletal and is increasingly thought to play significant roles in human cancers. We use TCGA and GEO to explore CLIC5 expression differences, mutation and DNA methylation, TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration. We verified the mRNA expression of CLIC5 in human ovarian cancer cells by real-time PCR and detected the expression of CLIC5 as well as immune marker genes in ovarian cancer by immunohistochemistry. The pan-cancer analysis showed that CLIC5 is highly expressed in several malignant tumors. In some cancers, CLIC5 expression in tumor samples is associated with poorer overall survival. For example, patients with ovarian cancer with high expression of CLIC5 have a poor prognosis. CLIC5 mutation frequency increased in all tumor types. The CLIC5 promoter is hypomethylated in most tumors. CLIC5 was associated with tumor immunity and different immune cells of different tumor types, such as CD8 + T cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, etc. CLIC5 was positively correlated with various immune checkpoints, and TMB and MSI were correlated with dysregulation of CLIC5 in tumors. The expression of CLIC5 in ovarian cancer was detected by qPCR and IHC, and the results were consistent with the bioinformatics results. There were a strong positive correlation between CLIC5 expression and M2 macrophage (CD163) infiltration and a negative correlation with CD8 + T-cell infiltration. In conclusions, our first pan-cancer analysis offered a detailed grasp of the cancerogenic functions of CLIC5 in a variety of malignancies. CLIC5 participated in immunomodulation and performed a crucial function in the tumor microenvironment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04927-4.",0
SummaryThis article describes a case of a man in his early 40s who was diagnosed with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PPC). PPCs are rare and aggressive forms of lung cancer. Chemotherapy is of limited efficacy. We present a case that has seemingly recurred shortly after adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy following an R0 resection for localised disease. Biopsy however was negative for recurrence. PPCs may bear actionable mutations and tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used when appropriate. Immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy is emerging as the mainstay for metastatic disease despite a lack of evidence from randomised clinical trials.,"ABSTRACTPatients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have very poor long-term outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can potentially cure some of these patients who are able to achieve a second or greater remission with salvage chemotherapy. Unfortunately, several barriers exist to transplantation and not all patients with r/r AML are able to proceed to allo-SCT. Therefore, novel therapies to decrease the risk of relapse in these patients are urgently needed. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein has emerged as an encouraging vaccine target in AML due to its overexpression in leukemic blast cells and near absence in normal hematopoietic cells. Maintenance therapy with galinpepimut-S, a multivalent heteroclitic WT1 peptide vaccine, holds promise in early phase trials, in patients with AML by inducing a strong innate immune response against the WT1 antigen, leading to the design of this international, open-label, randomized clinical trial, named REGAL.

"PurposeTo investigate oncological outcomes and patterns of recurrence of patients undergoing adjuvant “sandwich” chemo-radio-chemotherapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer.MethodsThis is a multi-institutional retrospective study evaluating chart of consecutive patients undergoing chemo-radio-chemotherapy for FIGO stage III–IVA endometrial caner.ResultsThe study population included 45 patients who had adjuvant sandwich regimen. Median age of the study population was 66 years. The majority of patients were diagnosed with endometrioid histology and with stage III disease. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 15 patients developed recurrent disease. Three-year disease-free and overall survivals was 45% and 81%, respectively. Three-years site-specific disease-free survival was 85%, 92% and 48% for local, loco-regional, and distant recurrence, respectively. All patients included in the study had nodal dissection. Nodal assessment included: sentinel node mapping, sentinel node mapping plus backup lymphadenectomy and lymphadenectomy in 15, 6 and 24 patients, respectively. The latter group included four patients detected by suspected enlarged nodes, intraoperatively. Even after the exclusion of patients with enlarged nodes, the type of nodal assessment did not impact on survival outcomes (p > 0.2). Positive peritoneal cytology was the only factor associated with an increased risk of developing (any site) recurrence and distant-specific recurrence, independently. No factor predicted for overall survival.ConclusionAdjuvant “sandwich” chemo-radio-chemotherapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer guarantee promising local and loco-regional controls, but distant failure rate is high, thus suggesting the need for applying other systemic treatment strategies for these patients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03339-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","SummarySomatic mutations commonly occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Some mutant clones outgrow through clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and produce mutated immune progenies shaping host immunity. Individuals with CH are asymptomatic but have an increased risk of developing leukemia, cardiovascular and pulmonary inflammatory diseases, and severe infections. Using genetic engineering of human HSCs (hHSCs) and transplantation in immunodeficient mice, we describe how a commonly mutated gene in CH, TET2, affects human neutrophil development and function. TET2 loss in hHSCs produce a distinct neutrophil heterogeneity in bone marrow and peripheral tissues by increasing the repopulating capacity of neutrophil progenitors and giving rise to low-granule neutrophils. Human neutrophils that inherited TET2 mutations mount exacerbated inflammatory responses and have more condensed chromatin, which correlates with compact neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production. We expose here physiological abnormalities that may inform future strategies to detect TET2-CH and prevent NET-mediated pathologies associated with CH.",0
"AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.","AbstractBackgroundThe comparative effects of specific blood pressure (BP) lowering treatments on patient‐important outcomes following kidney transplantation are uncertain. Our 2009 Cochrane review found that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) improved graft function and prevented graft loss, while the evidence for other BP‐lowering treatments was limited. This is an update of the 2009 Cochrane review.ObjectivesTo compare the benefits and harms of different classes and combinations of antihypertensive drugs in kidney transplant recipients.Search methodsWe contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 3 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating any BP‐lowering agent in recipients of a functioning kidney transplant for at least two weeks were eligible.Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently assessed the risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised using the random‐effects model and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) processes. The primary outcomes included all‐cause death, graft loss, and kidney function.Main resultsNinety‐seven studies (8706 participants) were included. One study evaluated treatment in children. The overall risk of bias was unclear to high across all domains.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, CCBs probably reduce all‐cause death (23 studies, 3327 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) and graft loss (24 studies, 3577 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). CCBs may make little or no difference to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (11 studies, 2250 participants: MD 1.89 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 4.48; I2 = 48%; low certainty evidence) and acute rejection (13 studies, 906 participants: RR 10.8, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). CCBs may reduce systolic BP (SBP) (3 studies, 329 participants: MD ‐5.83 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐10.24 to ‐1.42; I2 = 13%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (DBP) (3 studies, 329 participants: MD ‐3.98 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐5.98 to ‐1.99; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). CCBs have uncertain effects on proteinuria.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) may make little or no difference to all‐cause death (7 studies, 702 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.21; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), graft loss (6 studies, 718 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.13; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), eGFR (4 studies, 509 participants: MD ‐2.46 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐7.66 to 2.73; I2 = 64%; low certainty evidence) and acute rejection (4 studies, 388 participants: RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.04; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). ACEi may reduce proteinuria (5 studies, 441 participants: MD ‐0.33 g/24 hours, 95% CI ‐0.64 to ‐0.01; I2 = 67%; low certainty evidence) but had uncertain effects on SBP and DBP.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may make little or no difference to all‐cause death (6 studies, 1041 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.31; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), eGRF (5 studies, 300 participants: MD ‐1.91 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐6.20 to 2.38; I2 = 57%; low certainty evidence), and acute rejection (4 studies, 323 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.29; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). ARBs may reduce graft loss (6 studies, 892 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.84; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), SBP (10 studies, 1239 participants: MD ‐3.73 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐7.02 to ‐0.44; I2 = 63%; moderate certainty evidence) and DBP (9 studies, 1086 participants: MD ‐2.75 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐4.32 to ‐1.18; I2 = 47%; moderate certainty evidence), but has uncertain effects on proteinuria.The effects of CCBs, ACEi or ARB compared to placebo or standard care alone on cardiovascular outcomes (including fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke) or other adverse events were uncertain.The comparative effects of ACEi plus ARB dual therapy, alpha‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists compared to placebo or standard care alone were rarely evaluated.Head‐to‐head comparisons of ACEi, ARB or thiazide versus CCB, ACEi versus ARB, CCB or ACEi versus alpha‐ or beta‐blockers, or ACEi plus CCB dual therapy versus ACEi or CCB monotherapy were scarce. No studies reported outcome data for cancer or life participation.Authors' conclusionsFor kidney transplant recipients, the use of CCB therapy to reduce BP probably reduces death and graft loss compared to placebo or standard care alone, while ARB may reduce graft loss. The effects of ACEi and ARB compared to placebo or standard care on other patient‐centred outcomes were uncertain. The effects of dual therapy, alpha‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists compared to placebo or standard care alone and the comparative effects of different treatments were uncertain.",1
"Uveal melanoma (UM) is a common health challenge worldwide as a prevalent intraocular malignancy because of its high mortality rate. However, clinical workers do not have an accurate prognostic tool now. Immune function is closely related to tumor development. Interestingly, researchers have identified that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are tightly associated with biological processes at the cellular level, particularly their involvements in immune response and its regulation of the growth of tumor cells. Hence, lncRNAs may be involved in the progression of uveal melanoma. UM patients’ RNA expression matrices were extracted from TCGA database. The targeted immune genes were filtered by weighted correlation network analysis and the immune-related lncRNAs with a high prognostic relevance were obtained by Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. Each sample was scored according to those lncRNA expression and divided into high-risk and low-risk group. We confirmed the sensitivity and independence of our risk model compared to the tumor mutation burden score. Finally, we demonstrated the clinical relevance of our model by examining its sensitivity to different drugs. The risk score based on our risk model was significantly independent of other clinical parameters in either univariate (hazard ratio = 109.852 [15.738–766.749], P value < .001) or multivariate (hazard ratio = 114.075 [15.207–855.735], P value < .001) analyses. The ROC curves of this model imply high predictive accuracy for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival (1-year area under the curve [AUC] = 0.849, 3-years AUC = 0.848, and 5-years AUC = 0.761). Our study revealed that immune-related lncRNAs are significant in the clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of UM patients. We successfully constructed a lncRNA-based prognostic risk model which may serve as a future reference for the diagnosis and prognosis of UM. Based on this model we also validated the sensitivity of some cancer drugs, which has implications for the future immunotherapy and drug development.","BackgroundLncRNAs and DNA methylation are both key regulators of tumorigenesis and immune regulation. However, the interaction between lncRNA and DNA methylation, their regulation and their clinical and immune relevance in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, we identified DNA methylation regulator-related lncRNAs through Pearson correlation analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Univariate Cox regression was used to screen DNA methylationrelated prognostic lncRNAs. Further, through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression, a prognostic model based on 13 lncRNAs was established. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis verified the accuracy of the model in predicting the survival of GC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses also confirmed that the risk score obtained from the risk model could be applied as an independent prognostic factor for patients with GC. Furthermore, based on the risk score and other clinicopathological characteristics that can be used as independent prognostic factors, we constructed a nomogram that could accurately determine the survival time of each patient. In addition, a lncRNA score was constructed using a principal component analysis algorithm to quantify the DNA methylation-related lncRNA expression patterns of individual tumors.ResultsWe found that a higher lncRNA score indicated a worse the prognosis and was associated with a reduced tumor mutation burden and immunosuppression. A low lncRNA score was related to an increase in neoantigen load and an increase in the anti-PDL1/CTLA4 immunotherapy response. Additionally, a low lncRNA score was related to a significant therapeutic advantage and clinical benefit.ConclusionsThis study describes a DNA methylation regulator-related lncRNA signature model, which provides a new approach for predicting therapeutic response and patient stratification in GC. Assessing lncRNA expression patterns in individual tumors will contribute to enhancing our understanding of tumor microenvironment infiltration and guide more effective immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05234-8.",1
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy that is often resistant to standard therapy. An immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and oncogenic mutations in KRAS have both been implicated as drivers of resistance to therapy. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) inhibition has not yet shown clinical efficacy, likely due to rapid acquisition of tumor intrinsic resistance. However, the unique PDAC TME also be a key driver in resistance. Herein, we found that long-term FAK inhibitor treatment leads to hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway in PDAC cells in both mouse models and tissues from treated human PDAC patients. Concomitant inhibition of both FAK (with VS-4718) and RAF-MEK (with avutometinib) induced tumor growth inhibition and increased survival across multiple PDAC mouse models. In the TME, we found that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) impaired the downregulation of cMyc by RAF-MEK inhibition in PDAC cells, resulting in resistance. By contrast, FAK inhibition reprogramed CAFs to suppress the production of FGF1, which can drive resistance to RAF-MEK inhibition. The addition of chemotherapy to combined FAK and RAF-MEK inhibition led to tumor regression, decrease in liver metastasis and improved long-term survival in KRAS-driven PDAC mouse models. Combination of FAK and RAF-MEK inhibition alone improved anti-tumor immunity and priming of T-cell responses in response to chemotherapy. These findings provided the rationale for the ongoing clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of avutometinib and defactinib in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in PDAC patients (RAMP 205; NCT05669482) and may suggest further paths for combined stromal and tumor targeting therapies.","AbstractAsthma exacerbation is a common clinical occurrence. The causal factors are not fully understood yet. Environmental pollution is linked to asthma exacerbation. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (MNP), an environmental pollutant, in asthma exacerbation. In this study, an airway allergy mouse model was established with ovalbumin as a specific antigen with or without the presence of MNP. The results showed that, in a mouse model, the intensity of airway allergy was significantly increased by exposure to MNP. RNAseq results showed an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated molecules and the Osm expression in airway epithelial cells of mice with airway allergy. Exposure of epithelial cells to MNP in culture induced the expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and ER stress associated molecules. The OSM receptor was expressed by macrophages. OSM could drive macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Inhibition of PERK, one of the key molecules of ER stress, or depletion of OSM receptor in macrophages, could effectively attenuate the MNP/ovalbumin protocol induced airway allergy. To sum up, by promoting ER stress, environmental pollutant MNP can cause airway epithelial cells to produce OSM. The latter induces macrophages to produce TNF-α, which can exacerbate airway allergy.",0
"PurposeThe application of platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents is the traditional treatment paradigm for advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma, which has changed with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ICI therapy versus chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma.MethodsA systematic literature search of Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed by two independent investigators. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs).ResultsThe patients treated with ICI monotherapy had no significant difference in OS than those treated with chemotherapy monotherapy (HR: 0.965, 95% CI 0.865–1.076, p = 0.518). However, the patients treated with ICI monotherapy had a higher ORR and lower incidence of high-grade (≥ grade 3) AEs than those treated with chemotherapy monotherapy (OR: 0.568, 95% CI 0.479–0.675, p < 0.001; OR: 0.614, 95% CI 0.446–0.845, p = 0.003). The patients treated with ICI in combination with chemotherapy had significantly better OS and PFS than those treated with chemotherapy alone (HR: 0.862, 95% CI 0.776–0.957, p = 0.006; HR: 0.788, 95% CI 0.707–0.879, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in ORR or the incidence of grade 3 or higher AEs (OR: 0.951, 95% CI 0.582–1.554, p = 0.841; OR: 0.942, 95% CI 0.836–1.062, p = 0.328).ConclusionICI monotherapy did not show statistically significant difference in OS but demonstrated higher ORR and lower incidence of high-grade (≥ grade 3) AEs. And a statistically significant OS and PFS benefit was found in patients treated with first-line ICI in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone.",The COSMIC-313 phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) tested the triplet combination of cabozantinib with nivolumab and ipilimumab in comparison with nivolumab plus ipilimumab control as fist-line systemic therapy in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The first results presented at the 2022 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress are a milestone for the renal cell carcinoma field because they signal the advent of triplet combinations as potential treatment options for our patients. The present commentary highlights some considerations and potential next steps based on these first impressions.,0
"IntroductionThymomas are uncommon tumors that originate from epithelial cells of thymus and may have varying clinical course.Materials and MethodsA retrospective review of medical records of thymoma patients treated between January 2012 and April 2022 at our institute was conducted.Results There were a total of 23 patients (12 males and 11 females) with median age of 52 years (range, 33–77 years). Eleven patients (47.8%) had associated paraneoplastic syndromes of which 10 (43.5%) had myasthenia gravis and 1 (4.3%) had pure red cell aplasia. Average maximal tumor diameter was 62 mm (28–160 mm). Masaoka-Koga stage distribution was as follows: stage I ( n = 2, 8.7%), IIA ( n = 4, 17.4%), IIB ( n = 1, 4.3%), IIIA ( n = 2, 8.7%), IIIB ( n = 4, 17.4%), IVA ( n = 7, 30.4%), and IVB ( n = 3, 13.1%). The World Health Organization type B2 was the commonest histology ( n = 12, 52.17%), followed by B3 ( n =7, 30.4%), B1 ( n = 2, 8.7%), AB ( n = 1,4.3%), and A ( n = 1, 4.3%). Six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide regimen, 22 (95.6%) underwent surgery, and 1 patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. R0 resection was attained in 20 (91%) patients, R1 resection in 1 (4.5%) patient, and R2 in 1 (4.5%) patient. All operated patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy (45–60 Gy in 25–30 fractions). Four patients relapsed at a median duration of 14 months (2–26 months). At a median follow-up of 6 years, 5-year overall survival was 67.1% and 5-year progression-free survival was 66.6%. Local control at 5 years was 86.6%. ConclusionDespite majority of our patients presenting at an advanced stage, the local control rates are encouraging and reinforce multimodality approach.","Background and Clinical Significance: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but may underlie diverse and potentially life-threatening immune-related adverse events (irAEs). They may cause various conditions leading to respiratory failure, including myasthenic syndromes and myositis. However, diaphragmatic paralysis (DP) has rarely been reported. To describe patients with diaphragmatic paralysis in a pharmacovigilance registry, we searched the prospective REISAMIC registry at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center (Villejuif, France) for cases of diaphragmatic palsy (DP) occurring from September 2014 to December 2021. Case Presentation: We identified three patients, in whom DP was confirmed by diaphragmatic ultrasonography, pulmonary function tests, and/or diaphragmatic electroneuromyogram. Diaphragmatic palsy was life-threatening in all patients, as it caused respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In all cases, a pre-existing subclinical paraneoplastic syndrome was detected. Onconeural antibodies (anti-titin and anti-VGCC) were detected in these patients before and after the initiation of ICI therapy, suggesting a mixed paraneoplastic syndrome with features overlapping those of myasthenic syndrome (myasthenia gravis in one patient and Lambert–Eaton syndrome in another) and myositis. Conclusions: Diaphragmatic palsy is a severe irAE potentially resulting from different mechanisms, including myositis and neuromuscular junction involvement (myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton). Antineuronal antibodies associated with such conditions were already present in our patients prior to immunotherapy initiation, suggesting ICIs could trigger flare-ups of pre-existing silent paraneoplastic autoimmune conditions.",1
"BackgroundImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has become a first-line treatment option for metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) patients who do not meet the criteria of cisplatin. Still, only a few people can benefit from it, so useful predictive markers are needed.MethodsDownload the ICB-based mUC and chemotherapy-based bladder cancer cohorts, and extract the expression data of pyroptosis-related genes (PRG). The LASSO algorithm was used to construct the PRG prognostic index (PRGPI) in the mUC cohort, and we verified the prognostic ability of PRGPI in two mUC and two bladder cancer cohorts.ResultsMost of the PRG in the mUC cohort were immune-activated genes, and a few were immunosuppressive genes. The PRGPI composed of GZMB, IRF1, and TP63 can stratify the risk of mUC. In IMvigor210 and GSE176307 cohorts, the P-values of Kaplan Meier analysis was < 0.01 and 0.002, respectively. PRGPI could also predict ICB response, and the chi-square test of the two cohorts had P-values of 0.002 and 0.046, respectively. In addition, PRGPI can also predict the prognosis of two bladder cancer cohorts without ICB therapy. The PRGPI and the expression of PDCD1/CD274 had a high degree of synergistic correlation. The Low PRGPI group showed prominent characteristics of immune infiltration and was enriched in the immune signal activation pathway.ConclusionThe PRGPI we constructed can effectively predict the treatment response and overall survival rate of mUC patients treated with ICB. The PRGPI can help mUC patients achieve individualized and accurate treatment in the future.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04902-z.","AbstractBackgroundSarcomatoid carcinomas (SC) are rare tumors with both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, linked to aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Sarcomatoid carcinoma of unknown primary (SCUP) is an exceedingly rare subset with limited literature and no standardized management guidelines. This study aims to characterize the clinical presentations, treatment patterns, and genomic landscape of SCUP.Patients and MethodsData were retrospectively collected from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cancer of Unknown Primary Registry. Patients included had biopsy-proven SC with no identifiable primary tumor despite comprehensive diagnostic evaluations. Baseline characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) results, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Kaplan–Meier survival estimates, and Cox proportional hazards regression.ResultsFifty-two SCUP patients were identified, with a median age of 60 years. Most patients presented with widely metastatic disease, particularly lytic bone lesions. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was noted in nearly half of the patients. IHC showed high positivity for AE1/AE3 and OSCAR antibodies. Tumor NGS revealed 247 alterations, with TP53 being the most common mutation. Patients receiving definitive therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 72 months, significantly longer than those receiving systemic therapy (14 months). Immunotherapy was a significant prognostic factor, reducing the risk of death by 90%.ConclusionsThis study provides essential insights into the clinical and genomic characteristics of SCUP, advocating for the integration of definitive therapy and immunotherapy in treatment protocols. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and improve patient outcomes.",0
"The intricate expression patterns and oncogenic attributes of COL11A1 across different cancer types remain largely elusive. This study used several public databases (TCGA, GTEx, and CCLE) to investigate the pan-cancer landscape of COL11A1 expression, its prognostic implications, interplay with the immune microenvironment, and enriched signaling cascades. Concurrently, western blot analyses were performed to verify COL11A1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines and clinical samples. In addition, COL11A1 knockout cell lines were generated to scrutinize the functional consequences of COL11AI expression on cancer cell behavior by use MTT, colony formation, and scratch wound healing assays. A comprehensive database investigation revealed that COL11A1 was upregulated in a majority of tumor tissues and its expression was highly correlated with a patient’s prognosis. Notably, genetic alterations in COL11A1 predominantly occurred as mutations, while its DNA methylation status inversely mirrored gene expression levels across multiple promoter regions. Our findings suggest that COL11A1 helps to modulate the tumor immune landscape and potentially acts through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway to exert its oncogenic function. Western blot analyses further substantiated the specific upregulation of COL11A1 in LUAD cell lines and tissues, suggesting a close association with the EMT process. Ablation of COL11A1 in cancer cells significantly reduced their proliferative, clonogenic, and migratory abilities, underscoring the functional significance of COL11A1 in tumor cell behavior. Collectively, this research revealed the prevalent overexpression of COL11A1 in pan-cancer tissues, its profound prognostic and microenvironmental correlations, and the mechanistic underpinnings of its tumor-promoting effects as mediated via EMT signaling. Our findings suggest that COL11A1 could serve as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer.","PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.",1
"We describe a patient with extra-limbic seronegative encephalitis with relapsing progressive course as the harbinger of sequential Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Diffuse Large B-Cell lymphoma. Diagnosis of probable paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome (PNS) was arrived at by exhaustive elimination of alternative causes and supportive tissue diagnosis. This case highlights the phenotypic variety of paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes associated with hematologic malignancies and the challenges in their recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. We discuss and apply the updated consensus diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic syndromes to our case as a means of bolstering probability in cases of diagnostic uncertainty.","Rationale:Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a successful treatment for B-cell malignancies associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Cardiovascular toxicities have also been reported in this setting. However, there is scarce data regarding development of autonomic disorders after CAR-T cell therapy.Patient concerns:We report a case with a patient with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, refractory to 2 prior lines of immunochemotherapy, treated with CAR-T therapy.Diagnoses:Orthostatic hypotension secondary to autonomic dysfunction was diagnosed as manifestation of ICANS.Interventions:The patient received metilprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily for 3 days and anakinra 100 mg IV every 6h.Outcomes:The vast majority of autonomic symptoms ceased and 4 months after CAR-T therapy, autonomic dysfunction was resolved.Lessons:New-onset autonomic dysfunction can occur as manifestation of ICANS in patients who experience persistent neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms after resolution of acute neurotoxicity and should be early recognized. Differences in differential diagnosis, mechanisms and treatment approaches are discussed.",1
"PurposeAnlotinib is an oral small-molecule multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor that hampers neovascularization thus providing antitumor effect. The ALTER 0303 trial was a multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The ALTER 0303 results showed that patients in the anlotinib group had a median progression-free survival of 5.4 months, a significant improvement compared with 1.4 months in the placebo group; however, median overall survival was only extended by 3.3 months (9.6 vs 6.3 months). The problem of anlotinib resistance cannot be ignored, and an in-depth exploration of biomarkers of anlotinib treatment response is urgently needed to further improve the efficacy of anlotinib in the treatment of NSCLC. This study aimed to identify plasma exosome markers that could be used to monitor the efficacy of anlotinib.MethodsWe enrolled 5 patients with advanced NSCLC, and 15 blood samples were collected before anlotinib treatment, when the treatment was effective, and when the treatment was ineffective. The plasma exosomal RNA profiles were analyzed by whole-transcriptome sequencing at three different stages. The expression of dysregulated exosomal RNAs in 43 additional patients was also verified by real-time quantitative PCR.ResultsIn the plasma exosomal RNA profiles of the 5 patients with advanced NSCLC during treatment with anlotinib, 7 miRNAs, 3 lncRNAs, and 83 mRNAs were significantly dysregulated. The regulation trend was opposite when the treatment was effective and ineffective, showing dynamic changes. After validation, we finally found that plasma exosomal lnc-SNAPC5-3:4 was significantly upregulated when anlotinib treatment was effective, and it was significantly downregulated when the treatment failed (p < 0.05). Thus, it can be used as a potential biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of anlotinib.ConclusionOur results demonstrate the potential of plasma exosomal lnc-SNAPC5-3:4 as a biomarker for monitoring anlotinib efficacy.","PurposeNanobodies have become promising carriers due to excellent in vivo properties. Radiopharmaceutical therapy targeting programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an effective therapeutic strategy. Our study aimed to explore therapeutic efficacy of 131I labeled PD-L1 nanobody (Nb109) in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in vitro and in vivo.Methods131I-Nb109 was synthesized by chloramine-T method. We implemented stability analysis, SDS-PAGE and lipid-water partition coefficient test to assess its quality. Cell uptake assay and SPECT/CT scan were applied to evaluate its ability to target NSCLCs (H460 and A549). CCK8 assay and in vivo efficacy assay were conducted to estimate its therapeutic effect in H460 tumors. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) release in H460 cells incubated with 131I-Nb109 was investigated by western blot and ATP test kit.Results131I-Nb109 was hydrophilic with high labeling rate (69.51–98.06%), radiochemical purity (99.17% ± 0.76%) and stability. Cell uptake experiments showed that H460 cells (PD-L1 positive) compared with A549 cells (PD-L1 negative) had higher 131I-Nb109 uptake. SPECT/CT imaging revealed the accumulation of 131I-Nb109 in H460 tumor within 48 h. 131I-Nb109 inhibited H460 tumor growth without toxic side effects in contrast with control group. It also induced H460 cells to release DAMPs (adenosine triphosphate, high mobility group box 1, and heat shock protein 70).Conclusion131I-Nb109 had high stability, excellent ability to target and treatment PD-L1 positive tumors, and can improve tumor immunogenicity. The results of our study were expected to inspire the development of more novel radiopharmaceuticals to treat NSCLCs.",0
"We present a case of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with metastasis to the right ventricle (RV) successfully treated through surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). A 50-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, prompting transthoracic echocardiography that revealed a mobile, irregular RV mass measuring 40 × 32 mm. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed masses in the RV and the right pulmonary artery, which was totally occluded. Emergency surgical resection of both masses was performed to avoid sudden death. Histopathological analysis confirmed squamous cell carcinoma; however, the primary origin of the masses remained unidentified despite extensive evaluations, including positron emission tomography-CT. The final diagnosis was SCCUP. Immunohistochemistry indicated positive programmed cell death ligand 1, and postoperative chemotherapy with an ICI was administered. One year post-surgery, the patient remains healthy with no sign of recurrence.Learning objectiveThis case shows the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with cardiac metastasis through emergency surgery and postoperative immunotherapy. Despite the poor prognosis associated with cardiac metastatic malignant tumors and the lack of established treatment guidelines, this case highlights the potential benefits of surgical intervention and the efficacy of immunotherapy in managing cardiac metastatic SCCUP, with the patient remaining with no recurrence one-year post-surgery.","Eosinophils are often encountered in the stroma and peritumoral microenvironment of squamous cell carcinomas. Because eosinophils are readily identified on routine hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, researchers have explored multiple ways in which identifying the extent of eosinophil infiltration on routine biopsy and excisional specimens might provide diagnostic and prognostic information. We review the literature on this evolving topic.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in India. This review explores the epidemiological trends and the landscape of systemic therapy for HCC in the Indian context, acknowledging the recent shift in etiology from viral hepatitis to lifestyle-associated factors.A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, including data from the Global Cancer Observatory and the Indian Council of Medical Research, along with a critical analysis of various clinical trials. The article investigates systemic therapies in-depth, discussing their mechanisms, efficacy, and adaptation to Indian healthcare framework.Progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of ≤0.6 compared to sorafenib, overall survival of ∼16–19 months, and objective response rate of 20–30% are the defining thresholds for systemic therapy clinical trials. Systemic therapy for advanced HCC in India primarily involves the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, and cabozantinib, with sorafenib being the most commonly used drug for a long time. Monoclonal antibodies such as ramucirumab and bevacizumab and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, are expanding treatment horizons. Lenvatinib has emerged as a cost-effective alternative, and the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. Despite these advances, late-stage diagnosis and limited healthcare accessibility pose significant challenges, often relegating patients to palliative care.Addressing HCC in India demands an integrative approach that not only encompasses advancements in systemic therapy but also targets early detection and comprehensive care models. Future strategies should focus on enhancing awareness, screening for high-risk populations, and overcoming infrastructural disparities. Ensuring the judicious use of systemic therapies within the constraints of the Indian healthcare economy is crucial. Ultimately, a nuanced understanding of systemic therapeutic options and their optimal utilization will be pivotal in elevating the standard of HCC care in India.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors have markedly transformed cancer treatment paradigms but are frequently associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) affecting multiple organ systems. Among the rare and severe complications is the “triple M syndrome”, encompassing myositis, myocarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.We present the case of an 83-year-old male with stage IIc melanoma who received pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy following surgical excision of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes, with no evidence of neoplastic invasion. Approximately one month post-infusion, the patient experienced episodes of syncope, leading to the diagnosis of a second-degree atrioventricular block. Despite normal findings on echocardiography, the patient subsequently developed profound proximal muscle weakness, dysphonia, and dysphagia. Pembrolizumab was promptly discontinued, and the patient was initiated on high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone; however, his clinical course rapidly deteriorated, culminating in the necessity for palliative care due to progressive respiratory failure.This case underscores the potential for severe, life-threatening irAEs associated with pembrolizumab therapy, particularly in the form of triple M syndrome. Notably, the manifestations of myocarditis and myasthenia gravis (MG) within this context may occur in the absence of typical autoantibody markers, thereby complicating the diagnostic process and contributing to poor prognostic outcomes. This case highlights the imperative for heightened clinical vigilance and a proactive approach to monitoring for irAEs in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Early recognition, coupled with the prompt initiation of therapeutic interventions, is paramount in mitigating morbidity and improving clinical outcomes in these critical scenarios.",1
"Since the publication of the first issue of Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, we have witnessed advances in multiple research areas that have culminated in improved outcomes for many cancer types, although substantial unmet needs remain for a majority of patients worldwide. Here, we have asked experts in several key specialities to reflect on the progress from the past 20 years and propose the next steps to enable further advances. Although we are aware that this Viewpoint cannot provide full coverage of the vast field that is clinical oncology, we hope that these messages inspire a diverse range of readers.","Aim: Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx (COCO) often exhibit signs of immunosuppression, affecting their prognosis. Understanding the dynamics of humoral immunity in these patients during chemoradiation therapy is crucial for developing effective treatments.Materials & methods: This prospective study included 105 COCO patients undergoing different treatment regimens, with or without alpha/beta-defensins therapy. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, IgA and salivary sIgA were analyzed. Patients were divided into five groups based on treatment protocols.Results & conclusion: Treatment variations impacted serum immunoglobulin levels, notably in Group III, whose patients received radiation treatment and immunotherapy with higher alpha/beta-defensins doses. Significant IgG changes correlated with oral mucositis risk and outcomes. Further trials are necessary for validation and clinical application.",0
"AbstractBackgroundCD8+ T cells are critical for the oncogenesis and progression of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor microenvironment, receiving antigen signals from antigen-presenting cells and directly contributing to antitumor responses.SummaryCD8+ T cells mediate immunogenic cell death, facilitate immune signal transmission, and play a significant role in various treatments, including surgery, transarterial chemoembolization, and immunotherapy. Extensive research on the role of CD8+ T cells within the HCC microenvironment has shown considerable progress. Immunometabolic targets on CD8+ T cells have demonstrated potential in combination with immunotherapies for HCC; however, they have not yet reached the clinical trial stage.Key MessagesThis review provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on immune and immunometabolic targets of CD8+ T cells within the HCC microenvironment. By highlighting advances and potential mechanisms, this review aims to support the development of effective clinical strategies in this field.","PurposeThis study examined the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) in tumor cells and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma according to histological subtypes.MethodsWe evaluated PD-L1, PD-L2, and IDO1 expression in tumor cells and CD8-positive TILs in surgically resected specimens from 196 stage 0 or I lung adenocarcinoma patients by immunohistochemical staining. We also examined the relationships between the expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, and IDO1 in tumor cells and the density of CD8-positive TILs and clinical factors. Patients were divided into three groups: A, adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (N = 32); B, lepidic predominant invasive adenocarcinoma (IAD; LPA; N = 66); and C, IAD except for LPA (N = 98).ResultsPD-L1 was expressed only in Group C, but not in Groups A or B. The positive ratio of PD-L2 was significantly higher in Group C (63.3%), and that of IDO1 was also significantly higher in Group C (65.3%). The density of CD8-positive TILs was significantly higher in Group C (45 ± 2.4). There was no significant difference between the positive ratios of PD-L2 and IDO1 and the density of CD8-positive TILs in Group A (50.0%, 21.9%, and 36 ± 4.1, respectively) or Group B (60.6%, 25.8%, and 44 ± 3.0, respectively).ConclusionsNo cases in Groups A and B expressed PD-L1. The expression of immune-related factors, especially PD-L1 and IDO1, was significantly associated with Group C. This is the first report of the detailed examination of PD-L1, PD-L2, IDO1, and CD8 expression in lung adenocarcinoma subtypes with lepidic predominant components. Our results could help identify patients who would benefit from perioperative immunotherapy.",1
"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been associated with susceptibility and protection against a number of cancers. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to evaluate the overall influence of 127 HLA Class I and II alleles on 30 types of cancer. We found a preponderance of protective alleles (negatively correlated with cancer prevalences), especially for HLA Class I. Of the 30 cancers investigated, 13 were associated with mostly protective HLA effects whereas only 2 were associated with mostly susceptibility HLA alleles. Taken together, these findings highlight the broad influence of HLA on cancer and the complexity of HLA-cancer associations.","AbstractBACKGROUNDDue to the challenging location, adult malignant brainstem glioma can not undergo aggressive surgery and is associated with a quite poor prognosis. Effective therapy regimens for this disease have not been developed. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of anlotinib, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, combined with radiotherapy in treating this group of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis is an ongoing phase II, multicenter, single-arm trial investigating the safety, tolerability, and activity of anlotinib combined with radiotherapy in malignant brainstem glioma. Eligible participants include adults (18-70 years old) with newly diagnosed malignant (WHO III - IV) brainstem glioma based on histology or radiology who are radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biotherapy naïve. Patients with Karnofsky score < 40 and a life expectancy < 3 months are excluded. All participants received 54-60 Gy radiotherapy (RT,1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction, five days per week). Anlotinib (10mg, orally, daily, d1-14/3 weeks) concurrently administered with radiotherapy, then consolidatedly used until disease progression or occurrence of intolerable adverse events. The primary objective includes disease control rate (DCR) and 6-month progression-free survival rate (6m-PFS). The secondary objective includes overall survival (OS), and toxicity profile (NCT04668508). RESULTSAs of January 31, 2024, 19 participants have enrolled, all patients have completed radiotherapy. Sixteen patients who with a follow-up of 6 months or longer were included in the analysis for this report. The median age is 32 (range 18-68) years old. The median follow-up is 22.7 (range 6.0-38.3) months. Seven patients were pathologically diagnosed and nine patients were radiologically diagnosed with high-grade glioma. The DCR is 100% (Stable disease, SD: 16/16) at the end of radiotherapy and is 100% three months after radiotherapy (Partial response, PR: 2/16; SD: 14/16). The median PFS is 11.7 months, 95%CI 6.9-16.4, and the 6m-PFS and 1 year-PFS rates are 74.0% 11.2% and 36.3% 13.3%. The median OS is 18.7 months, 95%CI 10.7-34.7, the 6m-OS and 1 year-OS rates are 93.3% 6.4%and 58.3% 15.0%. No death occurred during the treatment. No ≥ grade 3 adverse events were observed up to the last follow-up (January 31, 2024) of this study. CONCLUSIONAnlotinib combined with radiotherapy is efficacious and well-tolerated and might be a treatment option for newly diagnosed malignant brain stem glioma in adults.",0
"AbstractBackgroundThe prescription of antitumor drugs has often been associated with drug-related problems. Pretherapeutic multidisciplinary risk assessment programs including pharmaceutical care have been established to secure the initiation of injectable and oral antitumor therapies. This prospective cross-sectional double-center study evaluated the clinical and economic impact of the pharmacist in detecting drug-related problems in patients initiating antitumor therapies.Materials and MethodsFollowing pharmaceutical consultations, pharmaceutical interventions were validated by a multidisciplinary team. A committee of independent clinical experts assessed the potential clinical impact of drug-drug interactions. The association of clinical variables with pharmaceutical interventions was tested using a multivariate logistic regression model. Pharmacist cost of the program was assessed by valuing pharmacists’ time at their salaries and compared with potentially avoided costs.ResultsFour hundred thirty-eight patients with solid tumors were included: 62% males, mean age of 65 ± 13 years, and average of 6 medications. Half of the patients required at least one pharmaceutical intervention and independent factors associated with pharmaceutical interventions were the number of medications (5-9 vs <5: OR = 2.91 [95% CI 1.82-4.65], P < .001) and the type of antitumor treatment (immunotherapy vs intravenous chemotherapy: OR = 0.35 [95% CI 0.18-0.68], P = .002). One hundred seventy-four out of 266 pharmaceutical interventions (130 patients) involved clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Pharmacist costs were estimated to range between €4899 and €6125. Average costs were estimated at €11.4-14.3 per patient. Avoided hospitalization costs were estimated to be €180 633.ConclusionClinical pharmacists contribute to the cost-effective reduction of drug-related problems in pre-therapeutic assessment programs for patients with cancer.","Pathological hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of microtubule-associated Tau protein contribute to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other related tauopathies. Currently, no cure exists for Alzheimer’s Disease. Aptamers offer significant potential as next-generation therapeutics in biotechnology and the treatment of neurological disorders. Traditional aptamer selection methods for Tau protein focus on binding affinity rather than interference with pathological Tau. In this study, we developed a new selection strategy to enrich DNA aptamers that bind to surviving monomeric Tau protein under conditions that would typically promote Tau aggregation. Employing this approach, we identified a set of aptamer candidates. Notably, BW1c demonstrates a high binding affinity (Kd = 6.6 nM) to Tau protein and effectively inhibits arachidonic acid (AA)-induced Tau protein oligomerization and aggregation. Additionally, it inhibits GSK3β-mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation in cell-free systems and okadaic acid-mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation in cellular milieu. Lastly, retro-orbital injection of BW1c tau aptamer shows the ability to cross the blood brain barrier and gain access to neuronal cell body. Through further refinement and development, these Tau aptamers may pave the way for a first-in-class neurotherapeutic to mitigate tauopathy-associated neurodegenerative disorders.",0
"The immune system plays a crucial role in protecting the body from invading pathogens and maintaining tissue homoeostasis. Maintaining homoeostatic lipid metabolism is an important aspect of efficient immune cell function and when disrupted immune cell function is impaired. There are numerous metabolic diseases whereby systemic lipid metabolism and cellular function is impaired. In the context of metabolic disorders, chronic inflammation is suggested to be a major contributor to disease progression. A major contributor to tissue dysfunction in metabolic disease is ectopic lipid deposition, which is generally caused by diet and genetic factors. Thus, we propose the idea, that similar to tissue and organ damage in metabolic disorders, excessive accumulation of lipid in immune cells promotes a dysfunctional immune system (beyond the classical foam cell) and contributes to disease pathology. Herein, we review the evidence that lipid accumulation through diet can modulate the production and function of immune cells by altering cellular lipid content. This can impact immune cell signalling, activation, migration, and death, ultimately affecting key aspects of the immune system such as neutralising pathogens, antigen presentation, effector cell activation and resolving inflammation.","Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been associated with susceptibility and protection against a number of cancers.

"AbstractBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with severe immune-related adverse events (s-irAEs) that result in hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, treatment discontinuation, or death. This study examined the impact of s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies on clinical outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsData were derived from ConcertAI Patient360 NSCLC, a US-based electronic medical record database, between January 2012 and May 2021. Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC and received ICI-containing therapy. s-irAEs and management actions were abstracted from unstructured EHR data from ICI initiation through the earliest of 100 days after ICI discontinuation, start of a non-ICI-containing regimen, loss to follow up, end of study period, or death. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies, and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS).ResultsThe study included 3211 patients. Median (IQR) age was 67 (60-73) years, and 44.9% were female. Most patients (61.6%) initiated ICIs as first-line therapy; half (50.1%) initiated ICIs as monotherapy, with nivolumab monotherapy (29.5%) as the most common initial ICI-containing regimen in any line. Overall, 8.6% of patients experienced s-irAEs, most often diarrhea (3.5%), pneumonitis (1.4%), and rash (1.3%). Among patients who experienced at least one s-irAEs, over half (57.4%) were hospitalized, and 71.8% were treated with corticosteroids, any time after the occurrence of their first s-irAEs. Median rwPFS was 4.9 (95%CI, 4.6-5.2) months, and median rwOS was 13.6 (12.6-14.7) months from ICI initiation. rwPFS and rwOS were comparable between patients with s-irAEs vs patients without s-irAEs when s-irAEs were first managed with anti-cancer treatment interruptions. Patients with s-irAEs had a 53% (22.3%-91.4%) higher risk of death than patients without s-irAEs when s-irAEs initially required corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants, and a 61% (37.9%-87.9%) higher risk of death when s-irAEs first required hospitalization or ED admission.ConclusionThe impact of s-irAEs on clinical outcomes may depend on the initial intervention required to manage the adverse event. s-irAEs were associated with worse outcomes when they initially required hospital/ED admission, corticosteroids, or other immunosuppression.","PurposeSkin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive melanocytic carcinoma whose high heterogeneity and complex etiology make its prognosis difficult to predict. This study aimed to construct a risk subtype typing model for SKCM.MethodsThe study proposes a deep learning framework combining early fusion feature autoencoder (AE) and late fusion feature AE for risk subtype prediction of SKCM. The deep learning framework integrates mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data of SKCM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and clusters the screened multi-omics features associated with survival prognosis to identify risk subtypes. Differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis were performed between risk subtypes, while SVM classifiers were constructed between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression screening and risk subtype labels inferred from multi-omics data, and the predictive robustness of risk subtypes inferred from the risk subtype classification prediction model was validated using two independent datasets.ResultsThe deep learning framework that combined early fusion feature AE with late fusion feature AE distinguished the two best risk subtypes compared to the multi-omics integration approach with single strategy AE or PCA. A promising C-index (C-index = 0.748) and a significant difference in survival (log-rank P value = 4.61 × 10–9) were found between the identified risk subtypes. The DEGs with the top significance values together with differentially expressed miRNAs provided the biological interpretation of risk subtypes on SKCM. Finally, the framework was applied to predict risk subtypes in two independent test datasets of SKCM patients, all of which showed good predictive power (C-index > 0.680) and significant survival differences (log-rank P value < 0.01).ConclusionThe SKCM risk subtypes identified by integrating multi-omics data based on deep learning can not only improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SKCM, but also provide clinicians with assistance in treatment decisions.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05358-x.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown significant efficacy in hematological diseases. However, CAR T therapy has demonstrated limited efficacy in solid tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). One of the most important reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune cells used to eliminate tumor cells. The human transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) plays a crucial role in forming the suppressive GBM TME and driving the suppression of the anti-GBM response. To mitigate TGF-β-mediated suppressive activity, we combined a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor II (dnTGFβRII) with our previous bicistronic CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 construct, currently being evaluated in a clinical trial, to generate CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII, a tri-modular construct we are developing for clinical application. We hypothesized that this approach would more effectively subvert resistance mechanisms observed with GBM. Our data suggest that CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII significantly augments T cell proliferation, enhances functional responses, and improves the fitness of bystander cells, particularly by decreasing the TGF-β concentration in a TGF-β-rich TME. In addition, in vivo studies validate the safety and efficacy of the dnTGFβRII cooperating with CARs in targeting and eradicating GBM in an NSG mouse model.","Aptamers, synthetic single-strand oligonucleotides with a similar function to antibodies, are promising as therapeutics because of their minimal side effects. However, the stability and bioavailability of the aptamers pose a challenge. We developed aptamers converted from RNA aptamer to modified DNA aptamers targeting phospho-AXL with improved stability and bioavailability.Based on the comparative analysis of a library of 17 converted modified DNA aptamers, we selected aptamer candidates, GLB-G25 and GLB-A04 that exhibited highest bioavailability, stability and robust anti-tumor effect in vitro experiments.Backbone modifications such as thiophosphate or dithiophosphate and a covalent modification of the 5’-end of the aptamer with polyethylene glycol optimized the pharmacokinetic properties, improved the stability of the aptamers in vivo by reducing nuclease hydrolysis and renal clearance, and achieved high and sustained inhibition of AXL at a very low dose.Treatment with these modified aptamers in ovarian cancer orthotopic mouse models significantly reduced tumor growth and the number of metastases. This effective silencing of the phospho-AXL target thus demonstrated that aptamer specificity and bioavailability can be improved by chemical modification of existing aptamers for phospho-AXL. These results lay the foundation for translation of these aptamer candidates and companion biomarkers to the clinic.",0
"BackgroundAlthough neoadjuvant immunotherapy is being widely studied, there is no consensus on its efficacy in microsatellite-stable (MSS) or mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate studies on neoadjuvant immunotherapy for advanced CRC to assess its efficacy and provide new clinical guidelines.MethodsWe searched literature databases to identify studies that assessed the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced CRC. The outcomes evaluated were pathological complete response (pCR), major pathological response (MPR), R0 resection, and anal preservation rates. Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed by sensitivity analysis, and publication bias was evaluated using Begg and Egger tests.ResultsEleven articles were included in the analysis. The pCR, MPR, R0 resection, and anal preservation rates reported in these studies were 39 and 49, 97, and 76%, respectively. The MSI-H and MSS groups had pooled pCR rates of 70 and 24%, respectively. The pCR rates for the induction, consolidation, and concurrent immuno-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) subgroups were 43, 33, and 27%, respectively, and those for the single and double immunotherapy subgroups were 34 and 40%, respectively.ConclusionNeoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with CRT is effective in treating MSI-H/dMMR advanced CRC. It could also be a new first-line therapeutic option for MSS/pMMR advanced CRC.","PurposeWe aimed to study the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) using bioinformatics.MethodsGSE39582 and GSE39084, which collectively contain 363 CRC samples, were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database as a test set. TCGA-COADREAD, with 376 CRC samples, was downloaded from the UCSC database as a validation set. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for ARGs that were significantly associated with prognosis. The top 10 ARGs were used to classify the samples into different subtypes based on unsupervised cluster analysis. The immune environments of the different subtypes were analyzed. ARGs that were significantly associated with CRC prognosis were used to construct a risk model. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen independent prognostic factors and construct a nomogram.ResultsFour anoikis-related subtypes (ARSs) with differential prognoses and immune microenvironments were identified. KRAS and epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathways were enriched in subtype B, which had the worst prognosis. Three ARGs (DLG1, AKT3, and LPAR1) were used to construct the risk model. Both the test and validation sets showed worse outcomes for patients in the high-risk group than those in the low-risk group. Risk score was found to be an independent prognostic factor for CRC. Moreover, there was a difference in drug sensitivity between the high- and low-risk groups.ConclusionThe identified ARGs and risk scores were associated with CRC prognosis and could predict the responses of patients with CRC to immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04945-2.",1
"Purpose:We evaluate the efficacy and safety of UGN-102 chemoablation for the primary treatment of patients with recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.Materials and Methods:ENVISION is an ongoing, multinational, single-arm, phase 3 study in patients with a biopsy-proven recurrence of untreated low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients received 6 weekly intravesical instillations of UGN-102 (mitomycin; outpatient setting) and were evaluated at 3 months. Patients achieving complete response (CR; negative cystoscopic examination, cytology, and for-cause biopsy) were surveilled regularly until recurrence, progression, or death. Patients who remain disease-free will be followed up to 5 years, and further results will be reported in the future.Results:Of 240 patients enrolled, 228 (95%) received all 6 planned doses; 191 (80%; 95% CI, 73.9-84.5) achieved CR at 3 months, with an 82% (95% CI, 75.9-87.1) probability of response 12 months later. Median duration of response was not estimable over a median 13.9-month follow-up period. The most common adverse events (≥5.0% of patients) were dysuria, hematuria, UTI, pollakiuria, fatigue, and urinary retention; generally mild/moderate and resolved/resolving. Serious adverse events were observed in 29/240 (12.1%); 2 were treatment related (urinary retention/urethral stenosis), and both resolved.Conclusions:Primary chemoablation with UGN-102 in patients with recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer resulted in an 80% CR rate. Patients achieving a CR had an 82% likelihood of remaining disease-free 1 year later. The benefit-risk profile was favorable, supporting UGN-102 as a nonsurgical alternative for transurethral resection of bladder tumors in this patient population. Limitations of this study included lack of tumor sizing after the diagnostic biopsy.Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05243550","PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are first-line treatment for melanoma. The incidence of musculoskeletal immune-related adverse events (MSK irAEs) remains unclear.ObjectiveTo estimate the relative risk of MSK irAEs in melanoma patients treated with ICIs targeting programmed cell death-1 or its ligand PD-(L)1 as compared to placebo.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature review including phase III randomized controlled trials of adult melanoma patients comparing a PD-(L)1 inhibitor to a placebo arm. Outcomes of interest included arthralgias, arthritis, back pain and myalgias. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled relative risk of MSK irAEs over the treatment course.ResultsFour RCTs met the inclusion criteria (n = 3,041 subjects). Use of PD-(L)1 inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of developing arthralgias (RR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.13–1.49]) and myalgias (RR 1.48 [95% CI: 1.17–1.87]) as compared to placebo. Back pain and arthritis were not reported.ConclusionsUse of PD-(L)1 inhibitors is associated with a significantly increased risk of arthralgias and myalgias in melanoma patients. The risk of back pain and arthritis is unknown.Implications for practiceMSK irAEs can impact quality of life and should be considered, particularly in the adjuvant setting when risks and benefits are carefully weighed.","Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, but resistance remains a significant clinical challenge. Myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment can modulate checkpoint resistance by either supporting or suppressing adaptive immune responses. Using an anti-PD-1-resistant mouse melanoma model, we show that targeting the myeloid compartment via CD40 activation and CSF1R blockade in combination with anti-PD-1 results in complete tumor regression in a majority of mice. This triple therapy combination was primarily CD40 agonist-driven in the first 24 hours post-therapy and showed a similar systemic cytokine profile in human patients as was seen in mice. Functional single-cell cytokine secretion profiling of dendritic cells (DCs) using a novel microwell assay identified a CCL22+CCL5+ IL12-secreting DC subset as important early-stage effectors of triple therapy. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are both critical effectors of treatment, and systems analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data supported a role for DC-secreted IL12 in priming T-cell activation and recruitment. Finally, we showed that treatment with a novel IL12 mRNA therapeutic alone was sufficient to overcome PD-1 resistance and cause tumor regression. Overall, we conclude that combining myeloid-based innate immune activation and enhancement of adaptive immunity is a viable strategy to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance.",1
"In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical research, the emergence of RNA-based therapeutics is paradigm shifting. It is mainly driven by the molecular adaptability and capacity to provide precision in targeting. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic crisis underscored the effectiveness of the mRNA therapeutic development platform and brought it to the forefront of RNA-based interventions. These RNA-based therapeutic approaches can reshape gene expression, manipulate cellular functions, and correct the aberrant molecular processes underlying various diseases. The new technologies hold the potential to engineer and deliver tailored therapeutic agents to tackle genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases in a highly personalized and precisely tuned manner. The review discusses the most recent advancements in the field of mRNA therapeutics for cancer treatment, with a focus on the features of the most utilized RNA-based therapeutic interventions, current pre-clinical and clinical developments, and the remaining challenges in delivery strategies, effectiveness, and safety considerations.","Activated fibroblasts are major mediators of pulmonary fibrosis. Fibroblasts are generally found in the connective tissue but upon activation can generate excess extracellular matrix (ECM) in the lung interstitial section. Therefore, fibroblasts are one of the most targeted cells for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here, we develop an anti-fibrotic platform that can modulate both the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1) and the inflammatory pathway through tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) in fibroblasts. First, we synthesized a series of LPA1 antagonists, AM095 and AM966, derived amino lipids (LA lipids) which were formulated into LA-lipid nanoparticles (LA-LNPs) encapsulating mRNA. Specifically, LA5-LNPs, with AM966 head group and biodegradable acetal lipid tails, showed efficient A20 mRNA delivery to lung fibroblasts in vitro (80.2% ± 1.5%) and ex vivo (17.2% ± 0.4%). When treated to primary mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF), this formulation inhibited fibroblast migration and collagen production, thereby slowing the progression of IPF. Overall, LA5-LNPs encapsulated with A20 mRNA is a novel platform offering a potential approach to regulate fibroblast activation for the treatment of IPF.",1
"PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the potential role of low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) as a radiosensitizer by evaluating its impact on the immune response and the abscopal effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy through preclinical models.Materials and MethodsCT26 tumors (immunologically hot) and 4T1 tumors (immunologically cold), grown in immunocompetent BALB/c and immunodeficient BALB/c–nude mice, were irradiated with 20 Gy in two fractions with 5-day spacing followed by intraperitoneal injections of 9 mg/kg Cy every 3 days. Immunological changes in CT26 tumors caused by the treatments were assessed using flow cytometry. Changes in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in tumors were also assessed. Splenocytes and bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (DCs) were exposed to various concentrations of Cy to assess T cell proliferation and DC differentiation.ResultsThe combination of Cy with radiotherapy (RT+Cy) significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to RT alone in immunocompetent mice, while that effect was not observed in immunodeficient mice. Additionally, RT+Cy effectively induced abscopal effects in hot and cold tumors, with increased CD8+ T cells in blood and tumors. Significantly higher expression levels of granzyme B, interferon γ, and tumor necrosis factor α were observed in RT+Cy group compared to the RT alone group. In vitro data indicated that low-dose Cy promotes DC differentiation. Low-dose Cy suppressed the radiation-induced upregulation of HIF-1α in the tumors.ConclusionLow-dose Cy enhances tumoricidal effects of 5-day spacing high-dose RT by increasing antitumor immune responses.","Summary paragraph:Interleukin-15 (IL15) promotes the survival of T lymphocytes and enhances the antitumor properties of CAR T cells in preclinical models of solid neoplasms in which CAR T cells have limited efficacy1-4. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is expressed in a group of solid cancers5-10, and here we report the first evaluation in humans of the effects of IL15 co-expression on GPC3-CAR T cells. Cohort 1 patients (NCT02905188/NCT02932956) received GPC3-CAR T cells, which were safe but produced no objective antitumor responses and reached peak expansion at two weeks. Cohort 2 patients (NCT05103631/NCT04377932) received GPC3-CAR T cells that co-expressed IL15 (15.CAR), which mediated significantly increased cell expansion and induced a disease control rate of 66% and antitumor response rate of 33%. Infusion of 15.CAR T cells was associated with increased incidence of cytokine release syndrome, which was rapidly ameliorated by activation of the inducible caspase 9 safety switch. Compared to non-responders, tumor-infiltrating 15.CAR T cells from responders showed repression of SWI/SNF epigenetic regulators and upregulation of FOS and JUN family members as well as genes related to type I interferon signaling. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IL15 increases the expansion, intratumoral survival, and antitumor activity of GPC3-CAR T cells in patients.",0
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious, progressive, and irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid β-protein (Aβ) to form senile plaques and abnormal phosphorylation of intracellular tau protein to form neuronal fiber tangles. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and there are several hypotheses, primarily including the Aβ cascade hypothesis, the neurofibrillary tangle hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, and the cholinergic hypothesis. It has been suggested that the dysregulation of multiple energy metabolic pathways, especially mitochondria metabolism, may be related to the severity of AD pathology and disease symptoms in the brain. The modification of histone (lysine) methylation, an actively regulated and reversible process, is closely related to energy metabolism and plays a crucial role in AD development. In summary, histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD restricted and regulated each other. Here, we review the advances in the correlation between histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD. This can provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and its control.","Cancer cells largely rely on aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect to generate essential biomolecules and energy for their rapid growth. The key modulators in glycolysis including glucose transporters and enzymes, for example hexokinase 2, enolase 1, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, play indispensable roles in glucose uptake, glucose consumption, ATP generation, lactate production, etc. Transcriptional regulation and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of these critical modulators are important for signal transduction and metabolic reprogramming in the glycolytic pathway, which can provide energy advantages to cancer cell growth. In this review we recapitulate the recent advances in research on glycolytic modulators of cancer cells and analyze the strategies targeting these vital modulators including small-molecule inhibitors and microRNAs (miRNAs) for targeted cancer therapy. We focus on the regulation of the glycolytic pathway at the transcription level (for example, hypoxia-inducible factor 1, c-MYC, p53, sine oculis homeobox homolog 1, N6-methyladenosine modification) and PTMs (including phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, etc.) of the key regulators in these processes. This review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of the key modulators in the glycolytic pathway and might shed light on the targeted cancer therapy at different molecular levels.",0
"Introduction: Colorectal cancer is the second most deadly cancer worldwide. Current screening methods have low detection rates and frequently provide false positive results, leading to missed diagnoses or unnecessary colonoscopies. To tackle this issue, the Wageningen UR iGEM team from 2022 developed “Colourectal”, a living diagnostic tool for colorectal cancer. Following a synthetic biology approach, the project used an engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 strain capable of binding to tumour cells that detects two distinct cancer biomarkers, and secretes a coloured protein observable in stool. Due to the utilization of genetically modified bacteria in vivo, precautionary biosafety measures were included within a three level safe-by-design strategy. Results: The first genetic safeguard ensured confinement of the living diagnostic to the colon environment by implementing auxotrophy to mucin that is abundant in the colon lining. For this, a synthetic chimeric receptor was generated to ensure expression of essential genes in the presence of mucin. The second strategy limited the viability of the engineered bacteria to the human body, preventing proliferation in open environments. The use of a temperature sensitive kill switch induced bacterial cell death at temperatures below 37°C. The third biocontainment strategy was installed as an emergency kill switch to stop the Colourectal test at any point. By inducing a highly genotoxic response through CRISPR-Cas-mediated DNA degradation, cell death of E. coli Nissle is triggered. Discussion: While the use of engineered microorganisms in human applications is not yet a reality, the safety considerations of our multi-layered strategy provide a framework for the development of future living diagnostic tools.","Background and Clinical Significance: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but may underlie diverse and potentially life-threatening immune-related adverse events (irAEs). They may cause various conditions leading to respiratory failure, including myasthenic syndromes and myositis. However, diaphragmatic paralysis (DP) has rarely been reported. To describe patients with diaphragmatic paralysis in a pharmacovigilance registry, we searched the prospective REISAMIC registry at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center (Villejuif, France) for cases of diaphragmatic palsy (DP) occurring from September 2014 to December 2021. Case Presentation: We identified three patients, in whom DP was confirmed by diaphragmatic ultrasonography, pulmonary function tests, and/or diaphragmatic electroneuromyogram. Diaphragmatic palsy was life-threatening in all patients, as it caused respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In all cases, a pre-existing subclinical paraneoplastic syndrome was detected. Onconeural antibodies (anti-titin and anti-VGCC) were detected in these patients before and after the initiation of ICI therapy, suggesting a mixed paraneoplastic syndrome with features overlapping those of myasthenic syndrome (myasthenia gravis in one patient and Lambert–Eaton syndrome in another) and myositis. Conclusions: Diaphragmatic palsy is a severe irAE potentially resulting from different mechanisms, including myositis and neuromuscular junction involvement (myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton). Antineuronal antibodies associated with such conditions were already present in our patients prior to immunotherapy initiation, suggesting ICIs could trigger flare-ups of pre-existing silent paraneoplastic autoimmune conditions.",0
"Purpose:Myocardial infarction (MI) with subsequent inflammation is one of the most common heart conditions leading to progressive tissue damage. A reliable imaging marker to assess tissue viability after MI would help determine the risks and benefits of any intervention. In this study, we investigate whether a new mitochondria-targeted imaging agent, 18F-labeled 2’-deoxy-2’−18F-fluoro-9-β-d-arabinofuranosylguanine ([18F]F-AraG), a positron emission tomography (PET) agent developed for imaging activated T cells, is suitable for cardiac imaging and to test the myocardial viability after MI.Procedure:To test whether the myocardial [18F]-F-AraG signal is coming from cardiomyocytes or immune infiltrates, we compared cardiac signal in wild-type (WT) mice with that of T cell deficient Rag1 knockout (Rag1 KO) mice. We assessed the effect of dietary nucleotides on myocardial [18F]F-AraG uptake in normal heart by comparing [18F]F-AraG signals between mice fed with purified diet and those fed with purified diet supplemented with nucleotides. The myocardial viability was investigated in rodent model by imaging rat with [18F]F-AraG and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) before and after MI. All PET signals were quantified in terms of the percent injected dose per cc (%ID/cc). We also explored [18F]FDG signal variability and potential T cell infiltration into fibrotic area in the affected myocardium with H&E analysis.Results:The difference in %ID/cc for Rag1 KO and WT mice was not significant (p = ns) indicating that the [18F]F-AraG signal in the myocardium was primarily coming from cardiomyocytes. No difference in myocardial uptake was observed between [18F]F-AraG signals in mice fed with purified diet and with purified diet supplemented with nucleotides (p = ns). The [18F]FDG signals showed wider variability at different time points. Noticeable [18F]F-AraG signals were observed in the affected MI regions. There were T cells in the fibrotic area in the H&E analysis, but they did not constitute the predominant infiltrates.Conclusions:Our preliminary preclinical data show that [18F]F-AraG accumulates in cardiomyocytes indicating that it may be suitable for cardiac imaging and to evaluate the myocardial viability after MI.","ABSTRACTAimsThis study aimed to develop novel molecular hybrid conjugates integrating isatin, rhodanine, and phthalimide pharmacophores to create effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents with improved safety profiles over existing treatments.Materials & MethodsA series of hybrid conjugates (4a – l) were synthesized and evaluated through in vitro and in vivo biological assays. The most promising compound, 4c, underwent extensive pharmacological and toxicological evaluations. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and 2D-QSAR studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism of action and validate the experimental findings.ResultsCompound 4c exhibited potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, effectively inhibiting COX-2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). Its superior selectivity index (SI) was 1.11 compared to 0.67 for indomethacin. It demonstrated an ulcer index of 2.9 versus 10.23 for indomethacin, indicating reduced gastrointestinal toxicity. Molecular docking simulations revealed a strong binding affinity with COX-2 (−9.832 kcal/mol), and molecular dynamics confirmed the stability of the COX-2 complex.ConclusionsCompound 4c emerged as a promising lead candidate for developing safer and more effective anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Its robust efficacy, safety profile, and computational validation highlight its potential for further optimization in therapeutic applications.",1
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with clinical benefit in lung cancer. However, response patterns to immunotherapy, including pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, are difficult to diagnose, and their mechanisms remain unclear. This review aimed to describe two response patterns observed in lung cancer, namely pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, including their epidemiology, diagnostic characteristics, and plausible mechanisms.MethodsWe performed a comprehensive literature search in the PubMed database, using keywords “pseudoprogression”, “hyperprogression”, and “lung cancer”, among others. The literature was examined for pseudoprogression and hyperprogression characteristics and plausible mechanisms.ResultsPseudoprogression manifests in multiple forms; however, the immune system-related response criteria and biopsy data are helpful to make accurate diagnosis. Serological biomarkers, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), might help distinguish pseudoprogression from true progression. The incidence of hyperprogression ranges within 5–19.2%, depending on definition. The unique response pattern of rapid progression is observed not only with immunotherapy, but also with other treatment regimens. Molecular mutations and amplifications may result in hyperprogression; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear.ConclusionAtypical response patterns, such as pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, are increasingly common in clinical practice. Immune-related response criteria can help diagnose pseudoprogression. Molecular mechanisms of hyperprogression remain unclear. Biomarkers for pseudoprogression and hyperprogression are required.","Purpose Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. To improve the therapeutic outcomes, drug delivery systems, and particularly liposomes, have been widely investigated. Therefore, this review analyzed systematically the literature to inquire about the safety and efficacy of liposomal formulations in lung cancer treatment.MethodsThree electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL) were systematically searched until May 2020. Clinical trials containing information about the effects of liposomal formulations in lung cancer patients were considered eligible.ResultsTwenty two selected studies present different treatment options for both small and non-small-cell lung cancers. After compiling and analyzing all the published information, we verified that combination of liposomal cisplatin and paclitaxel led to a statistically significant improvement of the evaluated outcomes. Moreover, tecemotide, a liposome-based immunotherapy, demonstrated lower toxicity compared to control groups. Evidences that other subgroups could benefit from this formulation were also provided.ConclusionThis systematic review (registration number CRD42021246587) demonstrates that liposomal formulations are promising alternatives to overcome limitations of traditional cancer therapy. However, larger, longer, randomized and double-blinded clinical trials, selecting their patients’ cohort considering more responsive subgroups would be beneficial to strengthen the scientific and clinical evidence of the results herein reported.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04079-x.",1
"ABSTRACTPatients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have very poor long-term outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can potentially cure some of these patients who are able to achieve a second or greater remission with salvage chemotherapy. Unfortunately, several barriers exist to transplantation and not all patients with r/r AML are able to proceed to allo-SCT. Therefore, novel therapies to decrease the risk of relapse in these patients are urgently needed. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein has emerged as an encouraging vaccine target in AML due to its overexpression in leukemic blast cells and near absence in normal hematopoietic cells. Maintenance therapy with galinpepimut-S, a multivalent heteroclitic WT1 peptide vaccine, holds promise in early phase trials, in patients with AML by inducing a strong innate immune response against the WT1 antigen, leading to the design of this international, open-label, randomized clinical trial, named REGAL. Clinical trial registration:  The clinical trial identifier is NCT04229979.","Adjuvants for vaccines with characteristics of improving adaptive immunity particularly via leverage of antigen presenting cells (APCs) are currently lacking. In a previous work we obtained a new soluble 300 kDa homogeneous β-glucan named GFPBW1 from the fruit bodies of Granola frondosa. GFPBW1 could activate macrophages by targeting dendritic cell associated C-type lectin 1 (Dectin-1)/Syk/NF-κB signaling to achieve antitumour effects. In this study the adjuvant effects of GFPBW1 were explored with OVA-antigen and B16-OVA tumor model. We showed that GFPBW1 (5, 50, 500 μg/mL) dose-dependently promoted activation and maturation of APCs in vitro by increasing CD80, CD86 and MHC II expression. We immunized female mice with OVA in combination with GFPBW1 (50 or 300 μg) twice with an interval of two weeks. GFPBW1 markedly and dose-dependently increased OVA-specific antibody titers of different subtypes including IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, suggesting that it could serve as an adjuvant for both Th1 and Th2 type immune responses. Furthermore, GFPBW1 in combination with aluminum significantly increased the titers of OVA-specific IgG2a and IgG2b, but not those of IgG1, suggesting that GFPBW1 could be used as a co-adjuvant of aluminum to compensate for Th1 deficiency. For mice immunized with OVA plus GFPBW1, no obvious pathological injury was observed in either major organs or injection sites, and no abnormalities were noted for any of the hematological parameters. When GFPBW1 served as an adjuvant in the B16-OVA cancer vaccine models, it could accomplish entire tumor suppression with preventive vaccines, and enhance antitumour efficacy with therapeutic vaccines. Differentially expressed genes were found to be enriched in antigen processing process, specifically increased tumor infiltration of DCs, B1 cells and plasma cells in the OVA plus GFPBW1 group, in accordance with its activation and maturation function of APCs. Collectively, this study systematically describes the properties of GFPBW1 as a novel potent and safe adjuvant and highlights its great potential in vaccine development.",0
"BackgroundIn Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Qi-deficiency and Phlegm-turbid stagnation (QP) are the most prevalent Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome.MethodsHerein, we collected 90 fecal samples (Healthy individual (H): 30; other syndrome (O): 30; QP: 30) and explored the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in LUAD patients with QP syndrome using 16s-rRNA sequencing. Then, we identified biomarkers for QP syndrome in LUAD patients with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) and applied logistic regression analysis to construct a diagnostic model evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and validated with data from metagenomics.ResultsThe α diversity and β diversity revealed that the microbiota community structure in LUAD patients with QP syndrome was different from that with healthy individuals and LUAD patients with other syndromes. At the phylum level, the QP group had more abundance of Bacteroidetes and less Proteobacteria than the O group. At the genus level, the abundance of 4 genera (Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, and Flavonifractor) was different between the QP group and O group. Moreover, LEfSe indicated that those 4 genera might be the biomarkers for LUAD patients with QP syndrome. Then, we used those 4 genera to develop a diagnostic model. The AUC based on 16s-rRNA sequencing and metagenomics was 0.989 and 1, respectively.ConclusionA diagnostic model was developed, which would be an available tool for the clinical diagnosis of LUAD with QP syndrome.","AbstractThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of Romboutsia ilealis on the immune function of broilers and the underlying mechanisms. A total of 48 one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were allocated to 4 groups as follows: broilers treated daily with 1 mL live R. ilealis in general anaerobic medium broth media (0, 1 × 104, 1 × 106, and 1 × 108 CFU/mL) from days 1 to 7. Samples were collected on days 8 and 14. The results showed that R. ilealis had no negative effect on the body weight of broilers (P > 0.05). R. ilealis significantly increased the levels of lysozyme, IFN-γ, IFN-γ/IL-4, and IgG in the serum (P < 0.05). R. ilealis significantly increased the levels of IL-4, IFN-γ, sIgA, lysozyme, and iNOS in the ileal mucosa (P < 0.05). R. ilealis significantly increased the mRNA levels of TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IgA, pIgR, iNOS, and MHC-II in the ileum (P < 0.05). R. ilealis significantly increased the relative abundance of Enterococcus and Paracoccus in the jejunum and ileum, ileal Candidatus Arthromitus, and cecal Romboutsia and Intestinimonas (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that Enterococcus, Paracoccus, Romboutsia, and Intestinimonas were significantly positively correlated with humoral immune function (P < 0.05). In conclusion, R. ilealis boosted the immune system, activated the intestinal TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway, and improved the gut microbiota in broilers.",1
"AbstractSuperficial cancers typically refer to cancers confined to the surface layers of tissue. Low-targeting therapies or side effects prompt exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), due to their unique optical properties, serve as effective photosensitizers, enabling tumor ablation through photothermal therapy (PTT). PTT induced by AuNPs can be achieved through light sources externally applied to the skin. Near-infrared radiation is the main light candidate due to its deep tissue penetration capability. This review explores recent advancements in AuNP-based PTT for superficial cancers, specifically breast, head and neck, thyroid, bladder and prostate cancers. Additionally, challenges and future directions in utilizing AuNPs for cancer treatment are discussed, emphasizing the importance of balancing efficacy with safety in clinical applications.","IntroductionThe urinary microbiome (UMB) includes living bacteria, their genomes, and their products from interactions with the host environment. A “core” UMB could potentially exist, with variations between age and sex groups. Changes in UMB composition have been associated with benign urological disorders, but also with urologic cancers. Mechanisms through which UMB can trigger and maintain cancer can be local inflammation and interaction with immune system.Aim of the studyTo describe the association between UMB and development of urologic cancers.MethodsA non-systematic literature review identified recently published studies (last 5 years), involving human patients, dealing with UMB. The database used for this review was PubMed, and the identified studies served as the base for a narrative analysis of the literature that explored the potential associations between UMB and urological cancers.ResultsIn bladder cancer (BC), UMB may play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (and thus to progression to metastasis), as well as in effectiveness of BCG response rate. BC is also associated with changes in UMB, with bacterial richness indices increased in cancer groups compared to non-neoplastic groups and being different between NMIBC vs MIBC patients. In prostate cancer (PCa), there is an abundance in proinflammatory bacteria and uropathogens. In regard to renal cell carcinoma (RCC), penile cancer and testicular cancer there are still too few studies to draw significant conclusions about its relationship with the UMB.ConclusionsGaining a deeper understanding of UMB role in urologic tumors could aid in the development of new therapies and improve classification of patients’ risk.",1
"ABSTRACTThe discovery of KRAS mutations, particularly the KRASG12C variant, has been a milestone in understanding the molecular underpinnings of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These mutations are associated with aggressive tumor behavior and resistance to conventional therapies, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions. In this comprehensive review, we analyze the advancements in KRAS G12C inhibitors for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Literature search is made from PubMed, Medline ASCO and ESMO Annual Meetings abstracts by using the following search keywords: “sotorasib”, “adagrasib”, “divarasib” and “KRAS G12C inhibitors.” The last search was on 5 June 2024. This review highlights the importance of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and potential adverse effects for treating individual patients and ensuring the best outcomes. Additionally, the review discusses research identifying biomarkers that can predict therapy responses and mentions the combination strategies to overcome resistance. Results of the studies and ongoing clinical trials are also briefly summarized in this review. KRASG12C inhibitors sotorasib, adagrasib and the newer divarasib, has revolutionized treating patients harboring this mutation. Ongoing studies and future clinical trials will refine our understandings with the ultimate goal of improving survival and quality of life for patients with this challenging disease.","ABSTRACTKirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation is prognostic of poor survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS G12C mutations occur in 13% of NSCLC cases and despite the frequency of this mutation, advances in drug development against KRAS have historically been impeded due to the extremely high affinity of KRAS for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and the lack of a binding pocket on the surface of KRAS that is suitable for drug binding. Sotorasib, a first-in-class, highly selective KRAS G12C inhibitor overcomes this issue by irreversibly binding in the switch-II pocket. Sotorasib was granted accelerated FDA approval for the treatment of KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This review summarizes the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and clinical considerations of sotorasib.",1
"Heart failure and cancer remain 2 of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and the 2 disease entities are linked in a complex manner. Patients with cancer are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications related to the cancer therapies. The presence of cardiomyopathy or heart failure in a patient with new cancer diagnosis portends a high risk for adverse oncology and cardiovascular outcomes. With the rapid growth of cancer therapies, many of which interfere with cardiovascular homeostasis, heart failure practitioners need to be familiar with prevention, risk stratification, diagnosis, and management strategies in cardio-oncology.This Heart Failure Society of America statement addresses the complexities of heart failure care among patients with active cancer diagnoses and cancer survivors. Risk stratification, monitoring and management of cardiotoxicity are presented across stages A through D heart failure, with focused discussion on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and special populations, such as survivors of childhood and young-adulthood cancers. We provide an overview of the shared risk factors between cancer and heart failure, highlighting heart failure as a form of cardiotoxicity associated with many different cancer therapeutics. Finally, we discuss disparities in the care of patients with cancer and cardiac disease and present a framework for a multidisciplinary-team approach and critical collaboration among heart failure, oncology, palliative care, pharmacy, and nursing teams in the management of these complex patients.","Infusion of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that target B cells has proven to be a successful treatment for B cell malignancies. This success inspired the development of CAR T cells to selectively deplete or modulate the aberrant immune responses that underlie autoimmune disease. Promising results are emerging from clinical trials of CAR T cells targeting the B cell protein CD19 in patients with B cell-driven autoimmune diseases. Further approaches are being designed to extend the application and improve safety of CAR T cell therapy in the setting of autoimmunity, including the use of chimeric autoantibody receptors to selectively deplete autoantigen-specific B cells and the use of regulatory T cells engineered to express antigen-specific CARs for targeted immune modulation. Here we highlight important considerations, such as optimal target cell populations, CAR construct design, acceptable toxicities and potential for lasting immune reset, that will inform the eventual safe adoption of CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",0
"Over the years, nanotechnology has gained popularity as a viable solution to address gene and drug delivery challenges over conventional methods. Extensive research has been conducted on nanosystems that consist of organic/inorganic materials, drugs, and its biocompatibility become the primary goal of improving drug delivery. Various surface modification methods help focus targeted and controlled drug release, further enabling multidrug delivery also. This newer technology ensures the stability of drugs that can unravel the mechanisms involved in cellular processes of disease development and its management. Tailored medication delivery provides benefits such as therapy, controlled release, and reduced adverse effects, which are especially important for controlling illnesses like cancer. However, multifunctional nanocarriers that possess high viscoelasticity, extended circulation half-life, biocompatibility, and biodegradability face some challenges and limitations too in human bodies. To produce a consistent therapeutic platform based on complex three-dimensional nanoparticles, careful design and engineering, thorough orthogonal analysis methods, and reproducible scale-up and manufacturing processes will be required in the future. Safety and effectiveness of nano-based drug delivery should be thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical trials, especially when considering biodistribution, targeting specific areas, and potential immunological toxicities. Overall, the current review article explores the advancements in nanotechnology, specific to nanomaterial-enabled drug delivery systems, carrier fabrication techniques and modifications, disease management, clinical research, applications, limitations, and future challenges. The work portrays how nanomedicine distribution affects healthcare with an emphasis on the developments in drug delivery techniques.","PurposeProgrammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) are immunosuppressive proteins known to be associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. However, their expression and clinical relevance in osteosarcoma remain unknown. In this study, the relationships of PD-L1 and IDO1 expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis were explored.MethodsThe expression of PD-L1, IDO1, CD3, CD4, and CD8 in 112 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues collected by biopsy or surgical resection from 56 osteosarcoma patients was evaluated immunohistochemically. Moreover, four osteosarcoma cell lines were evaluated for the effects of IFNγ on PD-L1 and IDO1 mRNA expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.ResultsIn pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) primary specimens, 10 cases (17%) showed PD-L1 expression and 12 (21%) showed IDO1 expression. Six of ten cases (60%) with PD-L1 positivity co-expressed IDO1. In post-NAC metastatic lesions, the frequency of immunoexpression of PD-L1 and IDO1 was increased compared with that in pre-NAC specimens. PD-L1 and/or IDO1 expression was not associated with poor prognosis. PD-L1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells; while, IDO1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T cells. In all osteosarcoma cell lines, PD-L1 and IDO1 expression was upregulated by stimulation with IFNγ.ConclusionOur results suggest that the PD-L1 and IDO1 immune checkpoint inhibitors may provide clinical benefit in osteosarcoma patients with metastatic lesions after conventional chemotherapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03242-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"PurposeMitophagy and aging (MiAg) are very important pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to tumorigenesis. MiAg-related genes have prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, prognostic, and immune correlation studies of MiAg-related genes in LUAD are lacking.MethodsMiAg differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LUAD were obtained from public sequencing datasets. A prognostic model including MiAg DEGs was constructed according to patients divided into low- and high-risk groups. Gene Ontology, gene set enrichment analysis, gene set variation analysis, CIBERSORT immune infiltration analysis, and clinical characteristic correlation analyses were performed for functional annotation and correlation of MiAgs with prognosis in patients with LUAD.ResultsSeven MiAg DEGs of LUAD were identified: CAV1, DSG2, DSP, MYH11, NME1, PAICS, PLOD2, and the expression levels of these genes were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). The RiskScore of the MiAg DEG prognostic model demonstrated high predictive ability of overall survival of patients diagnosed with LUAD. Patients with high and low MiAg phenotypic scores exhibited significant differences in the infiltration levels of eight types of immune cells (P < 0.05). The multi-factor DEG regression model showed higher efficacy in predicting 5-year survival than 3- and 1-year survival of patients with LUAD.ConclusionsSeven MiAg-related genes were identified to be significantly associated with the prognosis of patients diagnosed with LUAD. Moreover, the identified MiAg DEGs might affect the immunotherapy strategy of patients with LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05390-x.","Aging is a complex and universal process marked by gradual functional declines at the cellular and tissue levels, often leading to a range of aging-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Delaying the aging process can help prevent, slow down, and alleviate the severity of these various conditions, enhancing overall health and well-being. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are a class of widely used antidiabetic drugs that inhibit alpha-glucosidase in the small intestinal mucosa, delaying carbohydrate absorption and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. Beyond their roles in diabetes treatment, AGIs have shown potential in extending lifespan and effectively treating aging-related diseases by modulating oxidative stress, gut microbiota, inflammatory responses, and nutrient-sensing pathways. This review summarizes recent advancements in the application of AGIs for preventing and treating aging and aging-related diseases, with a focus on their mechanisms and roles in these processes.",0
"Background & Aims:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a heterogeneous and lethal malignancy, the molecular origins of which remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRs) target diverse signalling pathways, functioning as potent epigenetic regulators of transcriptional output. We aimed to characterise miRNome dysregulation in CCA, including its impact on transcriptome homeostasis and cell behaviour.Methods:Small RNA sequencing was performed on 119 resected CCAs, 63 surrounding liver (SL) tissues, and 22 normal (N) livers. High-throughput miR mimic screens were performed in 3 primary human cholangiocyte cultures. Integration of patient transcriptomes and miRseq together with miR screening data identified an oncogenic miR for characterization. MiR-mRNA interaction was investigated by luciferase assay. MiR-CRISPR knockout (KO) cells were generated and phenotypically characterized in vitro (proliferation, migration, colony, mitochondrial function, glycolysis) and in vivo by subcutaneous xenografts.Results:In total, 13% (140/1049) of detected miRs were differentially expressed between CCA and SL, including 135 upregulated in tumours. CCA tissues were characterised by higher miRNome heterogeneity and miR biogenesis pathway expression. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tumour miRNomes identified three subgroups, including dCCA-enriched and IDH1 mutant-enriched subgroups. High-throughput screening of miR mimics uncovered 71 miRs that consistently increased proliferation of 3 primary cholangiocyte models and were upregulated in CCA tissues regardless of anatomical location, among which only miR-27a-3p had consistently increased expression and activity in several cohorts. FoxO signalling was predominantly downregulated by miR-27a-3p in CCA, partially through targeting of FOXO1. MiR-27a KO increased FOXO1 levels in vitro and in vivo, impeding tumour behaviour and growth.Conclusions:The miRNomes of CCA tissues are highly remodelled, impacting transcriptome homeostasis in part through regulation of transcription factors like FOXO1. MiR-27a-3p arises as oncogenic vulnerability in CCA.","PurposeLong intergenic non-coding RNA LINC01088 is a newly discovered long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Its biological function in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown.MethodsHere, 36 paired CRC and para-cancerous tissues were collected. In vitro, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, qPCR, western blotting analysis and cellular functional experiments, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and dual-luciferase reporter system analysis were performed. In vivo, xenograft tumor mouse models were generated. Besides, patient-derived intestinal organoid (PDO) was generated ex vivo.ResultsWe found that LINC01088 was significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues and CRC cell lines compared to adjacent normal tissues and colonic epithelial cells. High LINC01088 levels were correlated with adverse outcomes in patients with CRC. LINC01088 was mainly located in the cytoplasm. LINC01088 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and immune escape of colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, LINC01088 bound directly to miR-548b-5p and miR-548c-5p that were significantly upregulated Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins 1 (G3BP1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, altering CRC cell phenotypes. In mouse xenograft models, LINC01088 knockdown restrained CRC tumor growth and lung metastasis. Furthermore, G3BP1 overexpression reversed LINC01088-knockdown-mediated inhibitory effects on tumor growth. Notably, LINC01088 knockdown downregulated PD-L1 expression, while G3BP1 overexpression restored PD-L1 expression in xenograft tumors. Besides, LINC01088 knockdown repressed CRC organoid growth ex vivo.ConclusionOverall, these findings suggested that LINC01088 directly targeted miR-548b-5p and miR-548c-5p, promoting G3BP1 and PD-L1 expression, which facilitated colorectal cancer progression and immune escape.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03981-8.",1
"Purpose of ReviewAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal blood neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in mitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by novel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluation.Recent FindingsMetabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity to therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial metabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a breakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial complexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting these vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy in preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results limited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on drug combinations with synergistic or additive activity.SummaryIn this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies targeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the specific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to achieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that currently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or are not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells. Thus, further studies of complex metabolic rewiring of leukemia cells before and after combinatorial therapies are warranted.","PurposeThe benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors’ (ICIs) combination therapy in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remained unclear. We performed a meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of ICIs’ combination therapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC.MethodsA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ICIs’ combination therapy as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC was conducted via searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database. The data for efficacy and safety of ICIs’ combination therapy were subject to meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with different PD-L1 expression status.ResultsA total of 5 RCTs and 3163 patients were included. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) benefit with ICIs’ combination therapy was 0.68 (95% CI 0.62–0.75) compared with chemotherapy alone. The HR for progression-free survival (PFS) benefit and the odds ratio (OR) for overall response rate (ORR) increase were 0.62 (95% CI 0.56–0.68) and 2.01 (95% CI 1.70–2.38), respectively. The OS and PFS benefits with ICIs’ combination therapy over chemotherapy alone were also observed in the subgroup of PD-L1 positive expression, but not in the subgroup of PD-L1 negative expression. The incidence of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events was 60.4% with ICIs’ combination therapy and 56.3% with chemotherapy alone (OR, 1.19; 95% CI 0.90–1.57).ConclusionICIs’ combination therapy showed superior OS, PFS, and ORR over chemotherapy alone with a manageable safety profile. These results suggested that ICIs’ combination therapy can be considered as a new first-line treatment for advanced ESCC.",1
"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) (∼50–150 nm) that have emerged as promising vehicles for therapeutic applications and drug delivery. These membrane-bound particles, released by all actively dividing cells, have the ability to transfer effector molecules, including proteins, RNA, and even DNA, from donor cells to recipient cells, thereby modulating cellular responses. RNA-based therapeutics, including microRNAs, messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, hold great potential in controlling gene expression and treating a spectrum of medical conditions. RNAs encapsulated in EVs are protected from extracellular degradation, making them attractive for therapeutic applications. Understanding the intricate biology of cargo loading and transfer within EVs is pivotal to unlocking their therapeutic potential. This review discusses the biogenesis and classification of EVs, methods for loading RNA into EVs, their advantages as drug carriers over synthetic-lipid-based systems, and the potential applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Notably, EVs show promise in delivering RNA cargo across the blood-brain barrier and targeting tumor cells, offering a safe and effective approach to RNA-based therapy in these contexts.","Aim: To develop a trivalent DNA vaccine candidate encapsulated in Chitosan-TPP nanoparticles against hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and assess its immunogenicity in mice.Materials & methods: Trivalent plasmid carrying the VP1 and VP2 genes of EV-A71, VP1 gene of CV-A16 was encapsulated in Chitosan-TPP nanoparticles through ionic gelation. In vitro characterization and in vivo immunization studies of the CS-TPP-NPs (pIRES-VP121) were performed.Results: Mice administered with CS-TPP NPs (pIRES-VP121) intramuscularly were observed to have the highest IFN-γ response. Sera from mice immunized with the naked pDNA and CS-TPP-NPs (pIRES-VP121) demonstrated good viral clearance against wild-type EV-A71 and CV-A16 in RD cells.Conclusion: CS-TPP-NPs (pIRES-VP121) could serve as a prototype for future development of multivalent HFMD DNA vaccine candidates.",1
"Purpose:Few studies have specifically targeted symptom management interventions for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. A greater understanding of AYA cancer survivors’ experiences with cancer treatment-related symptoms would help develop age-appropriate oncology symptom management interventions. The purpose of this qualitative analysis was to explore AYA cancer survivors’ experience with cancer treatment-related symptoms.Methods:Nineteen post-treatment AYA cancer survivors (18–39 years old) who self-reported moderate–severe cancer treatment-related symptom severity participated in video conferencing or telephone interviews. The questions in the interview guide queried participants to share their experience with cancer treatment-related symptoms. Inductive content analysis was used to identify themes from the interviews.Results:The themes that emerged from the interviews included  cancer treatment-related symptoms negatively affected AYA cancer survivors’ quality of life (for example, symptoms served as a reminder of cancer recurrence possibility);  AYA cancer survivors’ attitudes and feelings about communicating cancer treatment-related symptom concerns to clinicians (for example, patient–clinician communication was bolstered when AYAs perceived that symptoms were being taken seriously);  AYA cancer survivors are interested in oncology symptom management clinical trials, but logistical challenges are barriers to participation; and  AYA cancer survivors are interested in nonpharmacological treatments for symptom management.Conclusion:Results highlight the burden of cancer treatment-related symptoms on day-to-day life among post-treatment AYA cancer survivors. Future work is needed to identify nonpharmacological symptom management interventions, strategies to improve patient–clinician communication about symptoms, and strategies to increase the visibility and accessibility of symptom management clinical trials for AYA cancer survivors.","AbstractDupilumab has been approved to treat a variety of atopic disorders and was the first US FDA-approved medication for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), initially approved in May 2022, with expansion in use to patients as young as 1 year of age weighing at least 15 kg in January 2024.

"AbstractBackgroundInteractions between mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells (MES GSCs) and myeloid-derived macrophages (MDMs) shape the tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME), promoting the progression of glioblastoma (GBM). N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays important roles in the tumor progression. However, the mechanism of m6A in shaping the TIME of GBM remains elusive.MethodsSingle-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA-seq datasets were employed to identify the critical role of WTAP in interactions between MES GBM and MDMs. The biological function of WTAP was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, mass spectrum, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted.ResultsHere, we identified that m6A methyltransferase Wilms’ tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), whose protein stability could be synergistically enhanced via OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation and USP7-mediated de-ubiquitination, promoted LOXL2 m6A modification to enhance its mRNA stabilization in an IGF2BP2-dependent manner, upregulating secretion of LOXL2 protein (sLOXL2). sLOXL2 then interacted with integrin α5β1 on GSCs to activate FAK-ERK signaling, inducing mesenchymal transition of GSCs in an autocrine manner. Meanwhile, sLOXL2 also activated the integrin α5β1-FAK-ERK axis in MDMs, which promoted M2-like MDM phenotypes in a paracrine pathway, thereby contributing to T-cell exhaustion to induce GBM immune escape. In translational medicine, combinations of the OGT inhibitor by targeting WTAP expression and the LOXL2 antagonist by disrupting MES GSC and MDM interactions showed favorable outcomes to the anti-PD1 immunotherapy.ConclusionsWTAP plays critical roles in mesenchymal transition of GSCs and formation of TIME, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting WTAP and its downstream effectors to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.","PurposeEarly biochemical recurrence (eBCR) indicated a high risk for potential recurrence and metastasis in prostate cancer. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification played an important role in prostate cancer progression. This study aimed to develop a m6A lncRNA signature to accurately predict eBCR in prostate cancer.MethodsPearson correlation analysis was first conducted to explore m6A lncRNAs and univariate Cox regression analysis was further performed to identify m6A lncRNAs of prognostic roles for predicting eBCR in prostate cancer. The m6A lncRNA signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis (LASSO) in training cohort and further validated in test cohort. Furthermore, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were utilized to explore potential effective drugs for high-risk group in this study.ResultsFive hundred and thirty-eighth m6A lncRNAs were searched out through Pearson correlation analysis and 25 out of 538 m6A lncRNAs were identified to pose prediction roles for eBCR in prostate cancers. An m6A lncRNA signature including 5 lncRNAs was successfully built in training cohort. The high-risk group derived from m6A lncRNA signature could efficiently predict eBCR occurrence in both training (p < 0.001) and test cohort (p = 0.002). ROC analysis also confirmed that lncRNA signature in this study posed more accurate prediction roles for eBCR occurrence when compared with PSA, TNM stages and Gleason scores. Drug sensitivity analysis further discovered that various drugs could be potentially utilized to treat high-risk samples in this study. ConclusionsThe m6A lncRNA signature in this study could be utilized to efficiently predict eBCR occurrence, various clinical characteristic and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04040-y.",1
"mRNA vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary tool to generate rapid and precise immune responses against infectious diseases and cancers. Compared with conventional vaccines such as inactivated viruses, viral vectors, protein subunits or DNA-based vaccines, mRNA vaccines stand out owing to multiple advantages, including simplicity of design, fast production, enhanced safety and high efficacy. Nevertheless, efficient and targeted delivery of mRNA molecules remains a significant challenge owing to their inherent instability and susceptibility to degradation. Nanotechnology offers innovative solutions to surmount these obstacles and amplify the potency of mRNA vaccines. This Primer aims to outline a modular approach to developing biomaterials and nanotechnology for mRNA vaccines, with a focus on particle design, formulation evaluation and therapeutic applications. We delve into the underlying mechanisms of nanoparticle-facilitated mRNA protection, cellular uptake, endosomal escape and immune stimulation. We underscore the critical parameters that impact the manufacturing and clinical implementation of nanomaterial-based mRNA vaccines. Finally, we present the current limitations and future perspectives in the advancement of nanotechnology-enhanced mRNA vaccines for broad applications in prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.","Effective anti-tumor immunity is driven by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with specificity for tumor antigens. However, the factors that control successful tumor rejection are not well understood. Here we identify a subpopulation of CD8+ T cells that are tumor-antigen-specific and can be identified by KIR expression but paradoxically impair anti-tumor immunity in patients with melanoma. These tumor-antigen-specific KIR+CD8+ regulatory T cells target other tumor-antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, can be detected in both the tumor and the blood, have a conserved transcriptional program and are associated with a poor overall survival. These findings broaden our understanding of the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of human CD8+ T cells and implicate KIR+CD8+ regulatory T cells as a cellular mediator of immune evasion in human cancer.",0
"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is well known for its immune suppressive role, especially in solid tumors which are characterized by a thick, dense stroma. Apart from cell–cell interactions and biochemical signals, the tumor stroma is also characterized by its distinct mechanical properties, which are dictated by the composition and architecture of its extracellular matrix (ECM). Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the main producers and remodelers of the stromal ECM, and their heterogeneity has recently become a focus of intense research. This review describes recent findings highlighting CAF subtypes and their specific functions, as well as the development of 3D models to study tumor stroma mechanics in vitro. Finally, we discuss the quantitative techniques used to measure tissue mechanical properties at different scales. Given the diagnostic and prognostic value of stroma stiffness and composition, and the recent development of anti‐tumor therapeutic strategies targeting the stroma, understanding and measuring tumor stroma mechanical properties has never been more timely or relevant.","A century ago, Otto Warburg's work sparked the field of cancer metabolism, which has since taken a tortuous path. As evidence accumulated over the decades, consensus views of causes of cancer emerged, whereby genetic and epigenetic oncogenic drivers promoted immune evasion and induced new blood vessels and neoplastic metabolism to support tumor growth. Neoplastic cells abandon social cues of intercellular cooperation, escape tissue confinement, metastasize, and ultimately kill the host. Herein, key milestones in the study of cancer metabolism are chronicled with an emphasis on carbohydrate metabolism. The field began with a cancer cell–autonomous view that has been refined by a richer understanding of solid cancers as growing, immune-suppressive, complex organs comprising different cell types that are nourished by a variety of nutrients and variable amounts of oxygen through abnormal neovasculatures. Based on foundational historical studies, our current understanding of cancer metabolism offers a hopeful outlook for targeting metabolism to enhance cancer therapy.",0
"BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare solid malignancy with a poor prognosis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in tumorigenesis and progression. However, little is known about the role of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC.Methodsm6A-related lncRNAs were extracted by Pearson analysis, and then prognosis-related lncRNAs were filtered from the m6A-related lncRNAs by univariate Cox regression analysis. Based on the expression patterns of the prognosis-related lncRNAs, samples were classified into distinct clusters. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used to construct a m6A-lncRNA-related prognostic signature for PC patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate the prognostic ability of the model.ResultsA total of 178 tumor and 4 normal samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database in our study. Based on the expression of 12 filtered prognosis-related lncRNAs, two distinct clusters were eventually identified; these clusters were characterized by differences in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and prognosis. A risk model comprising ten m6A-related lncRNAs was identified as an independent predictor of prognosis. ROC analysis revealed that this model had an acceptable prognostic value for PC patients. The prognostic signature was related to the TIME and the expression of critical immune checkpoint molecules.ConclusionThis study comprehensively assessed the expression pattern and prognostic value of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC. The different clusters correlated with distinct TIMEs and prognoses. The study also constructed a ten-gene signature prognostic model based on m6A-related lncRNAs, which showed good accuracy in predicting overall survival.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03985-4.","BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is a prevalent and highly lethal malignancy affecting women worldwide. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for BC, offering potential improvements in patient survival. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has also gained significant clinical traction. With the advancement of computer technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied in pathology research, expanding and redefining the scope of the field. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature on the application of computational pathology in BC, specifically focusing on diagnosis, immune microenvironment recognition, and the evaluation of immunotherapy and NAT response.MethodsA thorough examination of relevant literature was conducted, focusing on studies investigating the role of computational pathology in BC diagnosis, immune microenvironment recognition, and immunotherapy and NAT assessment.ResultsThe application of computational pathology has shown significant potential in BC management. AI-based techniques enable improved diagnosis and classification of BC subtypes, enhance the identification and characterization of the immune microenvironment, and facilitate the evaluation of immunotherapy and NAT response. However, challenges related to data quality, standardization, and algorithm development still need to be addressed.ConclusionThe integration of computational pathology and AI has transformative implications for BC patient care. By leveraging AI-based technologies, clinicians can make more informed decisions in diagnosis, treatment planning, and therapeutic response assessment.

"AbstractPediatric brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children. Even to date, with the advances in multimodality therapeutic management, survival outcomes remain dismal in some types of tumors, such as pediatric-type diffuse high-grade gliomas or central nervous system embryonal tumors. Failure to understand the complex molecular heterogeneity and the elusive tumor and microenvironment interplay continues to undermine therapeutic efficacy. Developing a strategy that would improve survival for these fatal tumors remains unmet in pediatric neuro-oncology. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging as a feasible, safe, and promising therapy for brain tumors. The new paradigm in virotherapy implies that the direct cytopathic effect is followed, under certain circumstances, by an antitumor immune response responsible for the partial or complete debulking of the tumor mass. OVs alone or combined with other therapeutic modalities have been primarily used in adult neuro-oncology. A surge in encouraging preclinical studies in pediatric brain tumor models recently led to the clinical translation of OVs with encouraging results in these tumors. In this review, we summarize the different virotherapy tested in preclinical and clinical studies in pediatric brain tumors, and we discuss the limitations and future avenues necessary to improve the response of these tumors to this type of therapy.","Background:Large population-based registries, such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Registry, help in the study of rare tumors, including medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), but lack data to understand the natural history of the disease. The Medullary Thyroid Cancer Collaborative Registry (MTCCoRe) is an exhaustive multi-institutional collection of demographic, clinical, and pathological data. To determine the extent to which MTCCoRe represents the real-world MTC population, we compared the characteristics of patients enrolled in MTCCoRe with patients enrolled in population-based cancer registries.Methods:Comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics of MTC patients who were enrolled in MTCCoRe, Texas Cancer Registry (TCR), California Cancer Registry (CCR), and SEER between 1995 and 2018.Results:A total of 1416 patients were identified in MTCCoRe, 329 in TCR, 2105 in CCR, and 3820 in SEER. Percentages of patients 20–54 years in MTCCoRe were 58.0%, 50.2% in TCR, 47.2% in CCR, and 44.8% in SEER (p < 0.0001). About half of the patients were female (55.9% in MTCCoRe, 61.4% in TCR, 59% in CCR, and 57.5% in SEER (p = 0.3). Percentages of Hispanic and Black patients differed among cohorts (10.1% and 3.8% for MTCCoRe, 23.7% and 8.2% for TCR, 24.8% and 4.9% in CCR, and 15.9% and 8.2% for SEER, respectively; p < 0.001). MTCCoRe patients presented with more advanced T and N classifications than patients in the other registries (MTCCoRe, 28.6% T3-4 and 49.4% N1; TCR, 12.7% and 32.2%; CCR, 18.6% and 32.4%; and SEER, 24% and 37.8%; p < 0.0001). Prevalence of M1 disease was 10% in MTCCoRe, 11.9% in TCR, 14.1% in CCR, and 9.5% in SEER (p < 0.0001). In the MTCCoRe, 11.4% underwent systemic therapy (compared with 0.3% in TCR and 5.6% in CCR).Conclusions:The clinicodemographic profile of patients with MTC enrolled in a multi-institutional registry differs from those enrolled in population-based databases, with lower proportions of Hispanic and Black patients but additive data on treatment modalities. Moving forward, MTCCoRe and other registry and clinical trial enrollment efforts should intentionally include underrepresented groups via community engagement techniques, patient stakeholder involvement, and inclusion of languages other than English in study materials to yield more generalizable results and conclusions.",0
"IntroductionReceptor/ligand pair immune checkpoints are inhibitors that regulate immunity as vital “Don’t Find-Me” signals to the adaptive immune system, additionally, the essential goals of anti-cancer therapy. Moreover, the immune checkpoints are involved in treatment resistance in cancer therapy. The immune checkpoints as a signal from “self” and their expression on healthy cells prevent phagocytosis. Cells (for example, senescent and/or apoptotic cells) with low immune checkpoints, such as low CD47 and/or PD-L1, are phagocytosed, which is necessary for tissue integrity and homeostasis maintenance. In other words, cancer cells induce increased CD47 expression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), avoiding their clearance by immune cells. PD-L1 and/or CD47 expression tumors have also been employed as biomarkers to guide cure prospects. Thus, targeting innate and adaptive immune checkpoints might improve the influence of the treatments on tumor cells. However, the CD47 regulation in the TME stands intricate, so much of this process has stayed a riddle. In this line, less attention has been paid to cytokines in TME. Cytokines are significant regulators of tumor immune surveillance, and they do this by controlling the actions of the immune cell. Recently, it has been suggested that different types of cytokines at TME might cooperate with others that contribute to the regulation of CD47 and/or PD-L1.Materials and methodsThe data were searched in available databases and a Web Search engine (PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) using related keywords in the title, abstract, and keywords.ConclusionGiven the significant role of pro/anti-inflammatory signaling in the TME, we discuss the present understanding of pro/anti-inflammatory signaling implications in “Don’t Eat-Me” regulation signals, particularly CD47, in the pathophysiology of cancers and come up with innovative opinions for the clinical transformation and personalized medicine.","PurposeThis study aimed to develop a machine learning–based approach to identify prognostic gene signatures for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) using next-generation sequencing data from Asian populations.Materials and MethodsWe utilized next-generation sequencing data to analyze gene expression profiles and identify potential biomarkers.

We employed logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to validate the identified gene signatures.ResultsWe identified a gene signature significantly associated with relapse in TNBC patients. The predictive model demonstrated robustness and accuracy, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9087, sensitivity of 0.8750, and specificity of 0.9231. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a strong association between the gene signature and patient relapse, further validated by logistic regression analysis.ConclusionThis study presents a novel machine learning-based prognostic tool for TNBC, offering significant implications for early detection and personalized treatment. The identified gene signature provides a promising approach for improving the management of TNBC, contributing to the advancement of precision oncology.",1
"IntroductionLactylation is the covalent modification of histones using lactate as a small molecule precursor, playing a role in epigenetic regulation. As a novel protein post-translational modification, it has demonstrated significant relevance in the field of cancer diagnosis and therapy. However, the interaction between lactylation and tumor cells in breast cancer has not been extensively investigated.Material and methodsWe acquired breast cancer-related data from the GEO and TCGA databases. Lactylation-related genes were identified from the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We utilized Cox and LASSO regression to identify genes with significant prognostic value for constructing a prognostic model and assessing its predictive performance. This model was integrated with clinical parameters to create a nomogram. Finally, we conducted immune infiltration analysis, analyzed differences in biological functions, and assessed drug sensitivity.ResultsWe ultimately identified 3 lactylation-related genes significantly associated with prognosis. These genes were used to construct a prognostic model and calculate a risk score. Using the median score, patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. Notably, the low-risk group patients exhibited better prognosis and higher levels of immune infiltration. GO/KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that PGK1, the gene with the highest HR among these genes, is widely involved in immune, metabolic, and proliferative signaling pathways. Its high expression also correlates with increased sensitivity to anti-tumor drugs.ConclusionsThe study demonstrated the potential of lactylation-based molecular clustering and prognostic profiling for predicting survival, immune status, and treatment response in breast cancer patients. Additionally, we envision the use of PGK1 as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer.","AbstractObjectiveNon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading attributor to cancer deaths. High HDAC10 and low microRNA (miR)-223-5p levels have been observed in NSCLC. But their roles remain elusive. This study illustrated their roles in NSCLC cell ferroptosis and the mechanism.MethodsHDAC10, miR-223-5p, and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) levels in cells were determined by RT-qPCR. Iron ion content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione (GSH) levels were tested using reagent kits, and levels of SLC7A11 and Acyl-CoA synthesis long chain family (ACSL4) were examined using Western blot. Chromatin immunoprecision was performed to analyze the enrichment of HDAC10 and acetylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9ac) on the miR-223-5p promoter. The targeted binding of miR-223-5p and SLC7A11 was analyzed by dual-luciferase assay. Joint experiments were designed to identify the role of miR-223-5p/SLC7A11 axis in HDAC10-regulated ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.ResultsHDAC10 was highly expressed in NSCLC cells. Silencing HDAC10 significantly reduced GSH and SLC7A11 levels, upregulated iron ion content, ROS levels, and ACSL4 expression, promoting cell ferroptosis. Mechanically, HDAC10 inhibited miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby targeting SLC7A11. The joint experimental results showed that overexpression of SLC7A11 or downregulation of miR-223-5p alleviated the promoting effect of silencing HDAC10 on ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.ConclusionHDAC10 inhibits miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby promoting SLC7A11 expression and inhibiting ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.",0
"Purpose:We evaluate long-term outcomes of primary chemoablation using a mitomycin reverse thermal gel (UGN-101) in patients with low-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma.Materials and Methods:Patients who participated in the OLYMPUS trial (IRB No. TC-UT-03, NCT02793128) and achieved a complete response (CR) after 6 weekly doses of UGN-101 were followed up to 12 months after initial CR. Those with CR at study completion were eligible for long-term follow-up for up to 5 years or until disease recurrence, progression, or death.Results:Of the 71 patients enrolled in the OLYMPUS trial, 42 patients achieved CR 4 to 6 weeks after completing ≥ 1 instillation of UGN-101. Among the 41 patients followed after initial CR, median follow-up was 28.1 months (95% CI, 13.1-57.5), and median duration of response was 47.8 months (95% CI, 13.0–not estimable [NE]). Twenty patients (49%) had long-term follow-up (median 53.3 months [95% CI, 27.9-65.3]). Seventy-five percent of patients had no evidence of recurrence at the last follow-up, with median duration of response NE (95% CI, 43.5-NE) because of a low event rate.Conclusions:Primary intracavitary chemoablation with UGN-101 for low-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma is associated with favorable long-term durability.Clinical Trial Registration No.:NCT02793128","PurposeThe regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subpopulation of lymphocytes that suppress the immune responses. The prognostic value of Tregs in lymphoma patients remains controversial. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the role of Tregs in the prognosis of lymphoma patients.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to obtain eligible studies that evaluated the prognostic factor of Tregs for lymphoma patients. Hazards ratios (HRs) with the matching 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were merged to estimate the prognostic value of Tregs.ResultsWe finally retrieved 23 eligible studies, including a total of 2269 patients. The overall pooled analysis on all types of lymphomas showed that Tregs had a significantly positive association with prolonged overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.633, 95% CI 0.528–0.758) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.451, 95% CI 0.261–0.779). Subgroup analysis indicated that high Tregs were significantly correlated with longer OS in Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and natural killer/T cell lymphoma. However, there was no significant association of Tregs with T cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.ConclusionsIncreased Tregs indicates a better prognosis for patients with lymphoma. Tregs could be used as a valuable prognostic biomarker of lymphoma patients.",0
"ABSTRACTAimsStudy on the prognostic characteristics and biomarkers of lung cancer in Xuanwei Patients.Materials and MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on the genetic data of 261 NSCLC patients, as well as the prognostic data of 133 patients. The relationship between prognosis and EGFR mutations in the Xuanwei and non Xuanwei cohorts was compared and analyzed.ResultsThe superior progression-free survival (PFS) in Xuanwei patients was primarily observed in those with EGFR-mutated tumors (p < 0.05). Further analysis of accompanying mutations and TMB levels revealed an association between high TMB and a favorable prognosis in EGFR-mutated Xuanwei NSCLC.ConclusionXuanwei lung cancer differs from non Xuanwei patients in terms of prognosis and tumor mutation burden, and further research should be conducted.","PurposeTP53/EGFR co-mutation has been reported to affect the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, its impact on survival is unclear. In this analysis, we explored the prognostic effect of TP53/EGFR co-mutation in LUAD.MethodsClinical data and transcriptome sequencing of LUAD patients with matched genomic data were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for overall survival (OS) analysis. Differential expression genes (DEGs) were recognized by R software and bioconductor package. Clusterprofiler was used for functional analysis. STRING was used for estimating PPI information and plug-in CytoHubba to screen hub modules in Cytoscape. The association between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and survival was also analyzed.ResultsOS was shorter for patients carrying TP53 mutation (MUT) than that of wild type (WT) (37.7 m vs 52.8 m; p = 0.040, HR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.01–1.89). Dual TP53/EGFR-MUT was associated with inferior OS compared with the dual WT/WT cohort (38.4 m vs 51.9 m; p = 0.023, HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.95–3.52). 316 DEGs between dual TP53/EGFR-MUT and dual WT/WT samples were obtained and functional analysis made known that DEGs were strikingly enriched in regulating the metabolism of important amino acids, cell division, cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix composition. KEGG analysis discovered that DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and extracellular matrix receptor interaction. PPI network suggested that GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY genes were up-regulated in dual mutation samples. OS in the high TMB cohort was significantly better than that in the low TMB in patients with TP53 MUT(43.2 m vs 32.4 m; P = 0.007, HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81), as well as in the combination of TP53 MUT and EGFR WT group (44.4 m vs 31.2 m; P = 0.021, HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 − 0.89).ConclusionsTP53 MUT is a poor prognostic factor in LUAD patients, and the prognosis of TP53/EGFR co-mutation is worse. GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY may be novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for patients with dual TP53/EGFR mutation LUAD.",1
"Aim: To investigate how the sequence of checkpoint immunotherapy (CPI) and transarterial embolization (TAE) affects overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic melanoma.Materials & methods: This retrospective cohort study included 65 patients with metastatic melanoma who underwent both TAE and CPI between September 2011 and January 2022.Results: Significantly higher OS was seen in patients who received CPI before and after embolization (22 months, 95% CI 14-NR, p < 0.001) compared with only before embolization (4.5 months 95% CI, 14-NR). ≤3 hepatic metastasis (p < 0.01), more TAE procedures (p < 0.001) and CPI sequence (before and after embolization) (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of survival.Conclusion: Metastatic melanoma patients who underwent TAE have longer survival when CPI was sequenced both before and after embolization.","Background:Isolated limb infusion and perfusion (ILI/ILP) has been a mainstay treatment for unresectable melanoma in-transit metastases (ITM), but increased use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and intralesional therapy (talimogene laherparepvec [TVEC]) introduced several different management options. This study compares first-line ILI/ILP, ICI, and TVEC.Methods:Retrospective review from 12 international institutions included patients treated from 1990 to 2022 with first-line ILI/ILP, ICI, or TVEC for unresectable melanoma ITM.Results:A total of 551 patients were treated, with ILI/ILP (n = 356), ICI (n = 125), and TVEC (n = 70) with median follow-up of 5.5 years. Tumor burden was highest with ILI/ILP and lowest with TVEC (p = .002). Breslow thickness was lowest with TVEC (p = .007). TVEC was mostly used in stage IIIB disease versus IIIC for ILI/ILP and ICI (p = .01). Using ICI as the reference category, TVEC had the highest odds of a complete response (CR) (odds ratio, 1.96; p = .029) and a longer local progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.40; p = .003). ILI/ILP had shorter local PFS (HR, 1.72; p = .012), PFS (HR, 1.79; p < .001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (HR, 1.75; p = .014), overall survival (HR, 1.82; p = .009), and melanoma-specific survival (HR, 2.29; p = .004). Stage IIIB disease had longer DMFS (HR, 0.24; p < .001) compared to IIIC/D.Conclusions:TVEC as first-line therapy for unresectable melanoma ITM was associated with superior CR rates and local PFS. Notably, TVEC was used in patients with a lower Breslow thickness, disease stage, and tumor burden. Therefore, when compared to ILI/ILP and ICI, TVEC should be considered as first-line therapy for unresectable stage IIIB melanoma ITM with minimal tumor burden and lower Breslow thickness.",1
"BackgroundSinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) comprises <1% of all head and neck cancers but has one of the highest 5-year mortalities.MethodsA systematic review and analysis using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses) guidelines was conducted on SNMM survival, recurrence, and prognostic factors.Results A total of 2,379 abstracts were reviewed resulting in 90 studies describing 3347 SNMM patients. Patients were 49.65% male and 66.5 years old. Surgery plus radiation therapy, followed by surgery only, then radiation only were the most common treatments. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy were used in 418 patients and 101 respectively. The 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals are 55.97, 40.09, and 30.35%, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival and disease-specific survival are 25.56 and 38.04%. The 5-year local, regional, and distant recurrence-free survivals are 42.35, 81.64, and 44.65%. Mean survival after diagnosis was 26.99 months. Local ( n = 650), regional ( n = 226), and distant ( n = 723) failure presented after 19.36, 6.35, and 12.42 months. Sites of metastasis were lung, liver, bone, brain, skin, kidney, and adrenal glands. Distant metastases, disease in the paranasal sinuses, and higher stage were noted to have worse survival outcomes. Positive margins did not significantly impact overall survival in 11/12 studies. ConclusionOverall survival over 20 years has remained poor with 70% of patients deceased in 5 years. About half of patients will develop distant failure and will thereafter rapidly decline. These data indicate need for advances in treatment of SNMM and new efforts with targeted immunotherapy offer a promising avenue toward improving survival outcomes.","Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer (PC). Tryptophan oxidative catabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) cleaves the indole ring to kynurenine (Kyn), an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which activates multiple tumorigenesis pathways. The IDO1-Kyn-AhR axis is aberrantly dysregulated in mCRPC. (−)-Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid. CBD showed antitumor activities against human malignancies, including PC. CBD showed potent in vitro dose-dependent reduction of viability and clonogenicity of diverse human PC cell lines. CBD reduced the expression of IDO1 and AhR in PC cells. A daily 15 mg/kg oral dose of CBD for 30 days effectively suppressed the progression of the mCRPC CWR-R1ca-Luc cells xenografted in male nude mice. Continued CBD oral dosing for an additional 45 days suppressed the CWR-R1ca-Luc tumor locoregional and distant recurrences after the primary tumors’ surgical excision. Collected CBD-treated tumors showed a reduced level of IDO1 expression. CBD-treated mice displayed a significant systemic reduction of Kyn. CBD is a novel, nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid lead useful for the control of mCRPC via targeting the tryptophan catabolism.",1
"AbstractMultifaceted natural killer (NK) cell activities are indispensable for controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmission and pathogenesis. Among the diverse functions of NK cells, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) has been shown to predict better HIV-1 protection. ADCC is initiated by the engagement of an Fc γ receptor CD16 with an Fc portion of the antibody, leading to phosphorylation of the CD3 ζ chain (CD3ζ) and Fc receptor γ chain (FcRγ) as well as downstream signaling activation. Though CD3ζ and FcRγ were thought to have overlapping roles in NK cell ADCC, several groups have reported that CD3ζ-mediated signals trigger a more robust ADCC. However, few studies have illustrated the direct contribution of CD3ζ in HIV-1-specific ADCC. To further understand the roles played by CD3ζ in HIV-1-specific ADCC, we developed a CD3ζ knockdown system in primary human NK cells. We observed that HIV-1-specific ADCC was inhibited by CD3ζ perturbation. In summary, we demonstrated that CD3ζ is important for eliciting HIV-1-specific ADCC, and this dynamic can be utilized for NK cell immunotherapeutics against HIV-1 infection and other diseases.","PurposeLymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) has previously been used as a prognostic predictor in various solid tumors. This research aims in comparing the prognostic predictive Please check and conability of several inflammatory parameters and clinical parameters to validate further the excellent prognostic value of LMR in patients with gastric cancer treated with apatinib.MethodsMonitor inflammatory, nutritional parameters and tumor markers. Cutoff values of the parameters concerned were identified with the X-tile program. Subgroup analysis was made via Kaplan–Meier curves, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to find independent prognostic factors. The nomogram of logistic regression models was constructed according to the results.ResultsA total of 192 patients (115 divided into training group and 77 into validation group) who received the second- or later-line regimen of apatinib were retrospectively analyzed. The optimal cutoff value for LMR was 1.33. Patients with high LMR (LMR-H) were significantly longer than those with low LMR (LMR-L) in progression-free survival (median 121.0 days vs. median 44.5 days, P < 0.001). The predictive value of LMR was generally uniform across subgroups. Meanwhile, LMR and CA19-9 were the only hematological parameters with significant prognostic value in multivariate analysis. The area under the LMR curve (0.60) was greatest for all inflammatory indices. Adding LMR to the base model significantly enhanced the predictive power of the 6-month probability of disease progression (PD). The LMR-based nomogram showed good predictive power and discrimination in external validation.ConclusionLMR is a simple but effective predictor of prognosis for patients treated with apatinib.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04976-9.",0
"Tumor progression is accompanied by fibrosis, a condition of excessive extracellular matrix accumulation, which is associated with diminished antitumor immune infiltration. Here we demonstrate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) respond to the stiffened fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) by initiating a collagen biosynthesis program directed by transforming growth factor-β. A collateral effect of this programming is an untenable metabolic milieu for productive CD8+ T cell antitumor responses, as collagen-synthesizing macrophages consume environmental arginine, synthesize proline and secrete ornithine that compromises CD8+ T cell function in female breast cancer. Thus, a stiff and fibrotic TME may impede antitumor immunity not only by direct physical exclusion of CD8+ T cells but also through secondary effects of a mechano-metabolic programming of TAMs, which creates an inhospitable metabolic milieu for CD8+ T cells to respond to anticancer immunotherapies.","BackgroundLncRNAs and DNA methylation are both key regulators of tumorigenesis and immune regulation. However, the interaction between lncRNA and DNA methylation, their regulation and their clinical and immune relevance in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, we identified DNA methylation regulator-related lncRNAs through Pearson correlation analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Univariate Cox regression was used to screen DNA methylationrelated prognostic lncRNAs. Further, through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression, a prognostic model based on 13 lncRNAs was established. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis verified the accuracy of the model in predicting the survival of GC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses also confirmed that the risk score obtained from the risk model could be applied as an independent prognostic factor for patients with GC. Furthermore, based on the risk score and other clinicopathological characteristics that can be used as independent prognostic factors, we constructed a nomogram that could accurately determine the survival time of each patient. In addition, a lncRNA score was constructed using a principal component analysis algorithm to quantify the DNA methylation-related lncRNA expression patterns of individual tumors.ResultsWe found that a higher lncRNA score indicated a worse the prognosis and was associated with a reduced tumor mutation burden and immunosuppression. A low lncRNA score was related to an increase in neoantigen load and an increase in the anti-PDL1/CTLA4 immunotherapy response. Additionally, a low lncRNA score was related to a significant therapeutic advantage and clinical benefit.ConclusionsThis study describes a DNA methylation regulator-related lncRNA signature model, which provides a new approach for predicting therapeutic response and patient stratification in GC. Assessing lncRNA expression patterns in individual tumors will contribute to enhancing our understanding of tumor microenvironment infiltration and guide more effective immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05234-8.",0
"AbstractCancer remains a global health challenge, necessitating effective treatments with fewer side effects. Traditional methods such as chemotherapy and surgery often have complications. Pulsed electric fields and electroporation have emerged as promising approaches to mitigate these challenges. This study presents a comprehensive overview of electroporation as an innovative tool in cancer therapy, encompassing critical elements such as pulse generators and delivery devices. Furthermore, it introduces a simplified reversible electroporation model grounded in the Hodgkin–Huxley model. This model ensures resting potential stability by regulating ionic currents. When membrane charges reach the electroporation threshold, the model swiftly increases the fraction of open pores, resulting in a rapid rise in electroporation current. Conversely, as the transmembrane potential drops below the threshold, the model gradually reduces the fraction of open pores, leading to a gradual decline in electroporation current, indicating pore resealing. This model contributes to easier modeling and implementation of reversible electroporation dynamics, providing a valuable tool for further exploration of electroporation for cancer therapy.","Lung Cancer remains a significant health concern, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic avenues due to the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current treatments. In this study, we utilized a thorough in-silico and in-vitro methodology to develop prospective drugs for the treatment of lung cancer. The active components of Citrus latifolia were identified through the utilization of a variety of pharmacological instruments, such as Gene Ontology, GeneCards, DrugBank, the Chinese Traditional Drug Database, and GeneMANIA. Subsequent molecular docking studies using GOLD software revealed Hesperidin as the most promising candidate, exhibiting a remarkable binding affinity (GOLD score: 60.98 kcal/mol) towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a pivotal target in lung cancer therapy. Further validation through Schrodinger-Glide redocking reaffirmed the robust interaction between Hesperidin and EGFR. Pharmacokinetic profiling of top-scoring ligands indicated favorable drug-like properties, supporting their therapeutic potential. Molecular dynamics simulations employing Desmond software demonstrated the structural stability and persistence of the Hesperidin-EGFR complex over a 100-ns trajectory, corroborating its efficacy. Additionally, cytotoxicity analysis revealed a potent inhibitory effect of Hesperidin with an IC50 value of 34.25 µg/ml. Collectively, our findings underscore Hesperidin from Citrus latifolia as a promising candidate for lung cancer therapy, warranting further investigation through in-vivo studies for clinical translation.Graphical Abstract",0
"BackgroundIn CLEAR, lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (L+P) significantly improved efficacy versus sunitinib in first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We report results from CLEAR biomarker analyses.MethodsPD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing assays (whole exome sequencing/RNA-sequencing) were performed on archival tumor specimens.For IHC-derived/RNA-sequencing analyses, a continuous analysis was performed adjusting by Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score for: PD-L1 CPS versus best overall response (BOR)/PFS; and each gene-signature score (T-cell inflamed gene-expression profile [TcellinfGEP]/non-TcellinfGEP signatures including proliferation and angiogenesis) versus BOR/PFS.Association between mutation status of RCC driver genes and PFS were analyzed for genes for which ≥20 patients per arm had oncogenic alterations. Association of molecular subtypes with outcome was evaluated with baseline KPS adjustments. The set of biomarkers evaluated and statistical significance criteria for PD-L1 CPS, gene signature scores, and molecular subtypes were pre-specified.ResultsWithin-arm analyses using continuous values showed no association between PD-L1 levels and BOR/PFS for either treatment.PFS hazard ratios between arms were similar regardless of mutant or wildtype subgroups of RCC driver genes (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, KDM5C).No associations between PFS and gene-signature scores were observed for L+P. With sunitinib, high proliferation and MYC signature scores showed shorter PFS; high angiogenesis and microvessel density signature scores showed longer PFS.Six new molecular subtypes were defined. Tumors of patients with favorable/intermediate risk were enriched in angiogenesis and angiogenesis/stromal clusters; those with poor risk were enriched in proliferative and unclassified (low-TcellinfGEP/low-angiogenesis/low-proliferation) clusters. No association between molecular subtypes and PFS for L+P/sunitinib was observed (after adjustment for KPS and gene signatures that were individually associated with PFS).ConclusionsImprovements in ORR and PFS for L+P versus sunitinib in aRCC were observed consistently across a range of biomarker subgroups defined using RCC driver mutations, PD-L1, gene expression signatures, and molecular subtypes.","AbstractBackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a strong risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing hospitalization for COVID-19 with VTE.MethodsAdults hospitalized at 21 sites between March 2021 and October 2022 with symptoms of acute respiratory illness were assessed for COVID-19, completion of the original monovalent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination series, and VTE. Prevalence of VTE was compared between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients with COVID-19. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was calculated using a test-negative design. The VE was also stratified by predominant circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant.ResultsAmong 18 811 patients (median age [interquartile range], 63 [50–73] years; 49% women; 59% non-Hispanic white, 20% non-Hispanic black, and 14% Hispanic; and median of 2 comorbid conditions [interquartile range, 1–3]), 9792 were admitted with COVID-19 (44% vaccinated), and 9019 were test-negative controls (73% vaccinated). Among patients with COVID-19, 601 had VTE diagnosed by hospital day 28, of whom 170 were vaccinated. VTE was more common among unvaccinated than vaccinated patients with COVID-19 (7.8% vs 4.0%; P = .001). The VE against COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was 84% overall (95% confidence interval, 80%–87%), and VE stratified by predominant circulating variant was 88% (73%–95%) for Alpha, 93% (90%–95%) for Delta, and 68% (58%–76%) for Omicron variants.ConclusionsVaccination with the original monovalent mRNA series was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE, though data detailing prior history of VTE and use of anticoagulation were not available. These findings will inform risk-benefit considerations for those considering vaccination.",0
"Breast cancer has a high incidence and high heterogeneity among women worldwide, but its lack of highly consistent in vitro research models has limited the translation of experimental results into clinical applications. The emergence of tumor organoids in the new era has aroused great interest among scientists. Organoids possess multi-omics characteristics highly preserved from parental tumors and offer advantages such as long-term and stable passaging and visualization in vitro. Thus, they have overcome multiple defects of two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). However, the lack of inter-organoid homogeneity, vascular-like fluid system and complex microenvironment has affected their wider applications, making it urgent to introduce new approaches for developing a more comprehensive functionality of this model. In recent years, the combination of tumor organoids with other innovative technologies has provided some relevantly important solutions and made it an optimal high-throughput and high-fidelity in vitro model. Here, we provide an overview of the development and optimization of breast cancer organoids, discuss how they have been integrated with several emerging technologies, and further summarize their applications in functional precision oncology. We believe that the intersection of new technologies has great potential in breast cancer translational research, which may finally provide new insights into organoid-guided breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment.","Cellular therapies exhibit immense potential in treating complex diseases with sustained responses. The manufacture of cell therapies involves the purification and engineering of specific cells from a donor or patient to achieve a therapeutic response upon injection. Magnetic cell sorting targeting the presence or absence of surface markers is commonly used for upfront purification. However, emerging research shows that optimal therapeutic phenotypes are characterized not only by the presence or absence of specific antigens but also by antigen density. Unfortunately, current cell purification tools like magnetic or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) lack the resolution to differentiate populations based on antigen density while maintaining scalability. Utilizing a technique known as digital magnetic sorting (DMS), we demonstrate proof of concept for a scalable, magnetic-based approach to fractionate cell populations based on antigen density level. Targeting CD4 on human leukocytes, DMS demonstrated fractionation into CD4Hi T cells and CD4Low monocytes and neutrophils as quantified by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA seq. DMS also demonstrated high throughput processing at throughputs 3–10× faster than FACS. We believe DMS can be leveraged and scaled to enable antigen density-based sorting in cell therapy manufacturing, leading to the production of more potent and sustainable cellular therapies.",0
"Background:To improve patient selection for sentinel node (SN) biopsy, the Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA) created a predictive model based on readily available clinicopathologic factors.Objectives:Validation of the MIA nomogram using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), a nationwide oncology outcomes database for >1500 Commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States.Methods:A total of 60,165 patients were included in the validation. The probability of SN positivity was calculated for each patient. Using calculated probabilities, a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to assess the model’s discrimination ability.Results:At baseline, the NCDB cohort had different clinicopathologic characteristics compared with the original MIA data set. Despite these differences, the MIA nomogram retained high-predictive accuracy within the NCDB dataset (C-statistic, 0.733 [95% CI, 0.726–0.739]), although calibration weakened for the highest risk decile.Limitations:The NCDB collects data from hospital registries accredited by the Commission on Cancer.Conclusions:In conclusion, this study validated the use of the MIA nomogram in a nationwide oncology outcomes database collected from >1500 Commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States, demonstrating the potential for this nomogram to predict SN positivity and reduce the number of negative SN biopsies.","CRISPR-based forward genetic screening represents a powerful approach for the systematic characterization of gene function. Recent efforts have been directed towards establishing CRISPR-based tools for the programmable delivery of combinatorial genetic perturbations, most of which are mediated by a single nuclease and the expression of structurally identical guide backbones from two promoters. In contrast, we have developed CHyMErA (Cas Hybrid for Multiplexed Editing and Screening Applications), which is based on the co-expression of Cas9 and Cas12a nucleases in conjunction with a hybrid guide RNA (hgRNA) engineered by the fusion of Cas9 and Cas12a guides and expressed from a single U6 promoter. CHyMErA is suitable for the high-throughput deletion of genetic segments including the excision of individual exons. Furthermore, CHyMErA enables the concomitant targeting of two or more genes and can thus be used for the systematic mapping of genetic interactions in mammalian cells. CHyMErA can also be applied for the perturbation of paralogous gene pairs thereby allowing the capturing of phenotypic roles that would otherwise be masked due to genetic redundancy. Here, we provide instructions for the cloning of hgRNA screening libraries and individual hgRNA constructs, and offer guidelines for designing and performing combinatorial pooled genetic screens using CHyMErA. Starting with the generation of Cas9 and Cas12a-expressing cell lines, CHyMErA screening can be implemented within 15-20 weeks.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDIdentifying tumor rejection antigens continues to be a significant challenge in the development of effective immunotherapies and their application to pediatric brain tumors. METHODSTo identify candidate antigen targets for Medulloblastoma (primary MB, n=170; recurrent MB, n=21), Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG, n=10), and Pediatric High-Grade Astrocytoma (HGA, n=12) for adoptive cellular therapy, we conducted a comprehensive immunogenomic analysis of the transcription profiles of the most aggressive pediatric brain tumors and performed in silico antigen prediction across a wide range of antigen classes. IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDYPediatric brain tumors are heterogeneous diseases, and current standard treatments do not adequately address this variability. Newer and safer patient-specific treatment approaches are needed for high-risk patients who do not respond to standard therapies. Cellular immunotherapy could be crucial for improving survival and reducing morbidity. For an effective immune response against these brain tumors, appropriate tumor antigens must be targeted. While subgroup-specific genetic mutations in medulloblastoma patients have been reported, the immunogenicity of these genetic alterations remains unknown. Using a custom antigen prediction pipeline, we identified potential tumor rejection antigens with significant implications for the development of cellular therapies for MB, DIPG, and HGA. RESULTSAntigen prediction analysis revealed that most patients express few candidate neoantigen targets that pass all filtering criteria. Overall, the proportion of predicted tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) was higher than that of neoantigens and gene fusions for all molecular subtypes, except for SHH, which exhibited a higher neoantigen burden. Notably, cancer-testis antigens and previously unrecognized neurodevelopmental antigens were found to be expressed in most patients across all medulloblastoma subgroups. Although the absolute immune cell content is predicted to be low, immune gene-signature analysis revealed subgroup-specific differences.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an immune-enriched subset of breast cancer that has recently demonstrated clinical responsiveness to combinatorial immunotherapy. However, the lack of targeted interventions against hormone receptors or HER2 continues to limit treatment options for these patients. To begin expanding available interventions for patients with metastatic TNBC, we previously reported a therapeutic vaccine regimen that significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastases in a pre-clinical TNBC model. This heterologous vaccine approach “primed” mice with tumor lysate antigens encapsulated within poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid microparticles (PLGA MPs) then “boosted” mice with tumor lysates plus adjuvant. The use of the PLGA MP prime as monotherapy demonstrated no efficacy, suggesting that improving this component of our therapy would achieve greater vaccine efficacy. Here, we functionally improved the PLGA MP prime by coating microparticles with biotinylated streptavidin-conjugated using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminoproplyl) carbodiimide/ N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/Sulfo-NHS) linkers. This modification enhanced the immunostimulatory potential of our PLGA MPs, as evidenced by increased phagocytosis, maturation, and stimulatory ligand expression of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Therapeutic prime/boost vaccination of TNBC-bearing mice with surfaced-coated PLGA MPs significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastases by an average of 56% relative to mice primed with unmodified PLGA MPs, and a significant 88% average reduction in spontaneous lung metastases relative to untreated control mice. These findings illustrate that relatively common biotin-streptavidin conjugation formulations can positively affect microparticle-based vaccine immunogenicity resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy against established pre-clinical mammary tumors.",0
"Multigene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels have become a routine diagnostic method in the contemporary practice of personalized medicine. To avoid inadequate test choice or interpretation, a detailed understanding of the precise panel target regions is required. However, the necessary bioinformatic expertise is not always available, and publicly accessible and easily interpretable analyses of target regions are scarce. To address this critical knowledge gap, we present the Panel Comparative Analysis Tool (PanelCAT), an open-source application to analyze, visualize, and compare NGS panel DNA target regions. PanelCAT uses Reference Sequence, ClinVar, and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer mutation census databases to quantify the exon and mutation coverage of target regions and provides interactive graphical representations and search functions to inspect the results. We demonstrate the utility of PanelCAT by analyzing two large NGS panels (TruSight Oncology 500 and Human Pan Cancer Panel) to validate the advertised target genes, quantify targeted exons and mutations, and identify differences between panels. PanelCAT will enable institutions and researchers to catalog and visualize NGS panel target regions independent of the manufacturer, promote transparency of panel limitations, and share this information with employees and requisitioners.","PurposeCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a devastating complication with limited recognized clinical risk factors. We examined characteristics among solid and liquid cancers utilizing Machine learning (ML) approaches for predicting CRF.MethodsWe utilized 2017 National Inpatient Sample database and employed generalized linear models to assess the association between CRF and the outcome of burden of illness among hospitalized solid and non-solid tumors patients. And further applied lasso, ridge and Random Forest (RF) for building our linear and non-linear ML models.ResultsThe 2017 database included 196,330 prostate (PCa), 66,385 leukemia (Leuk), 107,245 multiple myeloma (MM), and 41,185 cancers of lip, oral cavity and pharynx (CLOP) patients, and among them, there were 225, 140, 125 and 115 CRF patients, respectively. CRF was associated with a higher burden of illness among Leuk and MM, and higher mortality among PCa. For the PCa patients, both the test and the training data had best areas under the ROC curve [AUC = 0.91 (test) vs. 0.90 (train)] for both lasso and ridge ML. For the CLOP, this was 0.86 and 0.79 for ridge; 0.87 and 0.84 for lasso; 0.82 for both test and train for RF and for the Leuk cohort, 0.81 (test) and 0.76 (train) for both ridge and lasso.ConclusionThis study provided an effective platform to assess potential risks and outcomes of CRF in patients hospitalized for the management of solid and non-solid tumors. Our study showed ML methods performed well in predicting the CRF among solid and liquid tumors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05197-w.",0
"Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by a complex interplay of lipid dysregulation, inflammation, and vascular pathology. Despite advancements in understanding the multifactorial nature of atherosclerosis and improvements in clinical management, existing therapies often fall short in reversing the disease, focusing instead on symptom alleviation and risk reduction. This review highlights recent strides in identifying genetic markers, elucidating inflammatory pathways, and understanding environmental contributors to atherosclerosis. It also evaluates the efficacy and limitations of current pharmacological treatments, revascularization techniques, and the impact of these interventions on patient outcomes. Furthermore, we explore innovative therapeutic strategies, including the promising fields of nanomedicine, nucleic acid-based therapies, and immunomodulation, which offer potential for targeted and effective treatment modalities. However, integrating these advances into clinical practice is challenged by regulatory, economic, and logistical barriers. This review synthesizes the latest research and clinical advancements to provide a comprehensive roadmap for future therapeutic strategies and emphasize the critical need for innovative approaches to fundamentally change the course of atherosclerosis management.","Atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of illness and mortality worldwide. The development of atherosclerosis is a complex process involving oxidative stress, surplus lipid deposition and retention, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. Developing novel anti-atherogenic and repurposing existing drugs requires the use of suitable animal models to characterise the fundamental mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis initiation and progression and to evaluate potential therapeutic effects. Commonly used rodent models, however, are not always appropriate, and other models may be required to translate these discoveries into valuable preventive and treatment agents for human applications. Recent advances in gene-editing tools for large animals have allowed the creation of animals that develop atherosclerosis faster and more similarly to humans in terms of lesion localisation and histopathology. In this review, we discuss the major advantages and drawbacks of the main non-rodent animal models of atherosclerosis, particularly rabbits, pigs, zebrafish, and non-human primates. Moreover, we review the application of recently invented novel therapeutic methods and agents, and repurposed existing drugs (such as antidiabetic and anticancer) for atherosclerosis treatment, the efficacy of which is verified on non-rodent animal models of atherosclerosis. In total, the proper selection of a suitable animal model of atherosclerosis facilitates reproducible and rigorous translational research in repurposing of existing drugs, discovering new therapeutic strategies, and validating novel anti-atherosclerotic drugs.",1
"BackgroundColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, which imposes a significant societal burden. Regular screening and emerging molecular tumor markers have important implications for detecting the progression and development of colorectal cancer. Disulfidptosis is a newly defined type of programmed cell death triggered by abnormal accumulation of disulfide compounds in cells that stimulate disulfide stress. Currently, there is no relevant discussion on this mechanism and colorectal cancer.MethodsWe classified the disulfidptosis-related subtypes of colorectal cancer using bioinformatics methods. Through secondary clustering of differentially expressed genes between subtypes, we identified characteristic genes of the disulfidptosis subtype, constructed a prognostic model, and searched for potential biomarkers through clinical validation.ResultsUsing disulfidptosis-related genes collected from the literature, we classified colorectal cancer patients from public databases into three subtypes. The differentially expressed genes between subtypes were clustered into three gene subtypes, and eight characteristic genes were screened to construct a prognostic model.ConclusionThe disulfidptosis mechanism has important value in the classification of colorectal cancer patients, and characteristic genes selected based on this mechanism can serve as a new potential biological marker for colorectal cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05211-1.","Bone metastatic prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in developed countries and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men. There remains no effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. We investigate here the anticancer effects of botanical component p-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) on the PC-3 cells in vitro model of bone metastatic human prostate cancer. Culturing with HCA (10–1000 nM) suppressed colony formation and growth of PC-3 cells. Mechanistically, culturing with HCA decreased protein levels of Ras, PI3K, Akt, MAPK, NF-κB p65 and β-catenin related to processes of cell signaling and transcription, and it increased levels of p21, p53, retinoblastoma and regucalcin, which are suppressors in carcinogenesis. These alterations can lead to suppression of cell growth. Furthermore, culturing with HCA increased cell death and caspase-3 levels. The effects of HCA on the growth and death of PC-3 cells were blocked by culturing with CH223191, an antagonist of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), suggesting that HCA effects are partly involved in AHR signaling. Interestingly, HCA suppressed the stimulatory effects of Bay K 8644, an agonist of L-type calcium channel, on the growth of PC-3 cells. Coculturing of PC-3 cells and preosteoblastic MC-3T3 E1 cells increased osteoblastic mineralization. This increase was not attenuated by treatment of HCA that stimulated mineralization. Notably, osteoclastogenesis from preosteoclastic RAW264.7 cells was enhanced by coculturing with PC-3 cells, and this enhancement was suppressed by treatment with HCA (10–1000 nM). Thus, HCA has anticancer effects on bone metastatic human prostate cancer, potentially providing a novel therapeutic tool.",1
"Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, but resistance remains a significant clinical challenge. Myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment can modulate checkpoint resistance by either supporting or suppressing adaptive immune responses. Using an anti-PD-1-resistant mouse melanoma model, we show that targeting the myeloid compartment via CD40 activation and CSF1R blockade in combination with anti-PD-1 results in complete tumor regression in a majority of mice. This triple therapy combination was primarily CD40 agonist-driven in the first 24 hours post-therapy and showed a similar systemic cytokine profile in human patients as was seen in mice. Functional single-cell cytokine secretion profiling of dendritic cells (DCs) using a novel microwell assay identified a CCL22+CCL5+ IL12-secreting DC subset as important early-stage effectors of triple therapy. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are both critical effectors of treatment, and systems analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data supported a role for DC-secreted IL12 in priming T-cell activation and recruitment. Finally, we showed that treatment with a novel IL12 mRNA therapeutic alone was sufficient to overcome PD-1 resistance and cause tumor regression. Overall, we conclude that combining myeloid-based innate immune activation and enhancement of adaptive immunity is a viable strategy to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance.","Local and systemic immunosuppression are prominent features of pancreatic cancer, rendering anti-tumor effector cells inactive and immunotherapeutic approaches ineffective. The spleen, an understudied point of antigen-presentation and T cell priming in humans, holds particular importance in pancreatic cancer due to its proximity to the developing tumor. As main effectors of antigen presentation, dendritic cells display antigens to lymphocytes, thereby bridging the innate and adaptive immune response. While tumor-infiltrating anti-inflammatory dendritic cells have been described, splenic dendritic cells have historically just been considered to stimulate the anti-tumor immune response. Here, we describe, for the first time, the presence of an immunosuppressive, tolerogenic IDO1+ dendritic cell subset in the spleens of pancreatic cancer patients that likely contributes to systemic immunosuppression that is associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Network analysis of scRNA seq data reveals extensive communication networks between the identified tolerogenic DC cluster and numerous immune cell populations in the spleen. Interactions with innate and adaptive immune cells suggest a broad influence on leukocyte trafficking and immune regulation within the spleen microenvironment. The identification of signaling pathways involving AHR and IDO-1, CCL19, NECTIN2, CLEC2D, and others elucidates potential mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive functions of this cell type.",1
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become an indispensable part of clinical practice; however, off-label use of these agents is unknown. We aimed to define the patterns of off-label use of ICIs in a nationwide sample of patients.MethodsThe online database (Reçetem) was retrospectively searched for off-label use cases related to ICIs approved during a 6-month period. Adult patients with metastatic solid tumors were included. Ethics approval was obtained. Reasons for off-label use were recorded in eight categories and cases were assessed for adherence to current guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed with GNU PSPP version 1.5.3.ResultsFive hundred seventy-seven reasons for use were recorded for 538 cases related to 527 patients (67.5% male). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (35.9%) was the most common cancer type. Nivolumab (49%), pembrolizumab (25.5%), and atezolizumab (25%) were commonly used. The top reason for off-label use was lack of approval for the cancer type (37.1%), followed by use beyond the approved treatment line (21%). Nivolumab was more frequently used than atezolizumab and/or pembrolizumab in patients with malignant melanoma, kidney cancer, head and neck cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, p < 0.001). The guideline adherence rate was 60.5%.ConclusionOff-label use of ICIs was primarily related to (NSCLC), and most patients were treatment-naïve in contrast to the acceptance that off-label use results from exhausted treatment options. Lack of approval is a significant reason for the off-label use of ICIs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04803-1.","AbstractIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors in young adults. This condition imposes a substantial burden on patients and their caregivers, marked by neurocognitive deficits and high mortality rates due to tumor progression, coupled with significant morbidity from current treatment modalities. Although surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy improve survival, these treatments can adversely affect cognitive function, quality of life, finances, employment status, and overall independence. Consequently, there is an urgent need for innovative strategies that delay progression and the use of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The recent Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval of vorasidenib, a brain-penetrant small molecule targeting mutant IDH1/2 proteins, heralds a shift in the therapeutic landscape for IDH-mutant gliomas. In this review, we address the role of vorasidenib in the treatment of IDH-mutant gliomas, providing a roadmap for its incorporation into daily practice. We discuss ongoing clinical trials with vorasidenib and other IDH inhibitors, as single-agent or in combination with other therapies, as well as current challenges and future directions.",0
"To evaluate the prognostic significance and molecular mechanism of NETosis markers in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OSC), we constructed a machine learning-based pathomic model utilizing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. We analyzed 333 patients with OSC from The Cancer Genome Atlas for prognostic-related neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) genes through bioinformatics analysis. Pathomic features were extracted from 54 cases with complete pathological images, genetic matrices, and clinical information. Two pathomic prognostic models were constructed using support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) algorithms. Additionally, we established a predictive scoring system that integrated pathomic scores based on the NETcluster subtypes and clinical signature. We identified four NETosis genes significantly correlated with OSC prognosis, which were functionally associated with immune response, somatic mutations, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Five robust pathomic features were selected for overall survival prediction. The LR and SVM pathomic models demonstrated strong predictive performance for the NETcluster subtype classification through five-fold cross-validation. Time-dependent ROC analysis revealed excellent prognostic capability of the LR pathomic model’s score for the overall survival (AUC values of 0.658, 0.761, and 0.735 at 36, 48, and 60 months, respectively), further validated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. The expression levels of NETosis genes greatly affected OSC patients’ prognoses. The pathomic analysis of H&E slide pathological images provides an effective approach for predicting both NETcluster subtype and overall survival in OSC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10278-024-01366-6.","PurposeTo explore interpretable machine learning (ML) methods, with the hope of adding more prognosis value, for predicting survival for patients with Oropharyngeal-Cancer (OPC).MethodsA cohort of 427 OPC patients (Training 341, Test 86) from TCIA database was analyzed. Radiomic features of gross-tumor-volume (GTV) extracted from planning CT using Pyradiomics, and HPV p16 status, etc. patient characteristics were considered as potential predictors. A multi-level dimension reduction algorithm consisting of Least-Absolute-Selection-Operator (Lasso) and Sequential-Floating-Backward-Selection (SFBS) was proposed to effectively remove redundant/irrelevant features. The interpretable model was constructed by quantifying the contribution of each feature to the Extreme-Gradient-Boosting (XGBoost) decision by Shapley-Additive-exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm.ResultsThe Lasso-SFBS algorithm proposed in this study finally selected 14 features, and our prediction model achieved an area-under-ROC-curve (AUC) of 0.85 on the test dataset based on this feature set. The ranking of the contribution values calculated by SHAP shows that the top predictors that were most correlated with survival were ECOG performance status, wavelet-LLH_firstorder_Mean, chemotherapy, wavelet-LHL_glcm_InverseVariance, tumor size. Those patients who had chemotherapy, with positive HPV p16 status, and lower ECOG performance status, tended to have higher SHAP scores and longer survival; who had an older age at diagnosis, heavy drinking and smoking pack year history, tended to lower SHAP scores and shorter survival.ConclusionWe demonstrated predictive values of combined patient characteristics and imaging features for the overall survival of OPC patients. The multi-level dimension reduction algorithm can reliably identify the most plausible predictors that are mostly associated with overall survival. The interpretable patient-specific survival prediction model, capturing correlations of each predictor and clinical outcome, was developed to facilitate clinical decision-making for personalized treatment.",1
"The gut microbiota influences the effectiveness and side effects of cancer treatments, particularly immunotherapy and associated immune-related complications. This important involvement of the microbiome is supported by the patients receiving antibiotics responding poorly to immunotherapy. Relatively few research has examined the underlying processes, and until recently, data regarding the detection of the microbial organisms that trigger these effects were inconsistent. Since then, a deeper comprehension of the processes of action and taxonomic classification of the relevant species has been attained. It's been demonstrated that certain bacterial species can enhance the body’s reaction to immune checkpoint inhibitors through the release of distinct metabolites or products. Nonetheless, in certain patients who are not responding, Gram-negative bacteria may have a dominating suppressive impact. Patients' propensity to react to immunotherapy can be somewhat accurately predicted by machine learning techniques based on their microbiome makeup. Consequently, there has been an increase in interest in modifying the microbiome makeup to enhance patient reaction to medication. Clinical proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that dietary modifications or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might be used therapeutically to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients. Current developments and new approaches for microbiota-based cancer treatments have been emphasized. In conclusion, preclinical research on animals and human clinical trials has made tremendous progress in our understanding of the function of the gut microbiome in health and illness. These investigations have shed light on the effects of food, FMT, probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiome-disease connections. However, there are still a lot of issues and restrictions that must be resolved before this research can be used in real-world clinical settings.Graphical Abstract","BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.",1
"SummaryPathologists play a central role in RCC patient care by confirming the diagnosis of malignancy, determining the histologic type of RCC, and assessing many important prognostic factors such as the pathological stage, nuclear grade, presence of sarcomatoid or rhabdoid features, and others. In recent years, our increased understanding of the molecular alterations driving specific RCC types has led to an improved classification scheme that better informs patient prognosis and treatment. In spite of this progress, no predictive biomarkers are currently approved for the management of patients with RCC. Pathologists are uniquely positioned to move the field forward by developing IHC/mIF-based predictors of outcome to ICI-based therapy that could be utilized in the clinic.","ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore the key oncogenic factor of metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MethodsWe utilized four differential GEO datasets (GSE164760, GSE139602, GSE197112, and GSE49541) to identify the key oncogenic factor for MASH-related HCC. The differential genes were analyzed using the GEO2R algorithm online. The GEPIA online website was used to explore the expression of selected four genes (SPP1, GNMT, CLDN11, and THBS2). The genetic alterations in genes were estimated by the cBioPortal website. The Kaplan-Meier Plotter online database was applied to explore the prognostic value of SPP1. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were carried out to further confirm the prognostic value of SPP1. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis exported associated pathways with SPP1 expression. The positively or negatively related immune cells and immune checkpoint expressions were identified through Pearson correlation analysis. The lipogenesis-associated proteins were detected using western blotting and fluorescence. The high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model was constructed, and liver samples were collected.ResultsSPP1, GNMT, CLDN11, and THBS2 were determined in the transformation process of MASH to liver fibrosis. SPP1 and GNMT were upregulated in the HCC tumor tissue. SPP1, in particular, had the potential to be the prognostic factor through Cox analysis. Remarkably, SPP1 was highly expressed in HCC compared to normal tissues in three independent datasets (GSE121248, GSE14520, and GSE45267). SPP1 is mainly involved in the amplification and deep deletion mutations. SPP1 was found to be strongly correlated with ANXA2 expression, and ANXA2 was also highly expressed in HCC with significant prognostic performance. Moreover, SPP1 was found to participate in the carcinogenic mechanism and correlate with immune cells and immune checkpoint expression. SPP1 knockdown suppressed the SREBP1 and FASN expressions and increased the SIRT1 expression in vitro. Moreover, the HFD model validated the upregulation of SPP1 in the fatty liver in vivo.ConclusionSPP1 may be the key oncogenic factor for the transformation of MASH to HCC, and it could be a potential immunotherapeutic target in HCC.",1
"Purpose:In patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), ATM and BRCA2 mutations dictate differences in PARPi inhibitor response and other therapies. We interrogated the molecular features of ATM- and BRCA2-mutated mPC to explain the divergent clinical outcomes and inform future treatment decisions.Experimental Design:We examined a novel set of 1,187 mPCs after excluding microsatellite-instable (MSI) tumors. We stratified these based on ATM (n = 88) or BRCA2 (n = 98) mutations. As control groups, mPCs with mutations in 12 other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes were considered non-BRCA2/ATM HRR-deficient (HRDother, n = 193), whereas lack of any HRR mutations were considered HRR-proficient (HRP; n = 808). Gene expression analyses were performed using Limma. Real-world overall survival was determined from insurance claims data.Results:In noncastrate mPCs, only BRCA2-mutated mPCs exhibited worse clinical outcomes to AR-targeted therapies. In castrate mPCs, both ATM and BRCA2 mutations exhibited worse clinical outcomes to AR-targeted therapies. ATM-mutated mPCs had reduced TP53 mutations and harbored coamplification of 11q13 genes, including CCND1 and genes in the FGF family. BRCA2-mutated tumors showed elevated genomic loss-of-heterozygosity scores and were often tumor mutational burden high. BRCA2-mutated mPCs had upregulation of cell-cycle genes and were enriched in cell-cycle signaling programs. This was distinct from ATM-mutated tumors.Conclusions:Tumoral ATM and BRCA2 mutations are associated with differential clinical outcomes when patients are stratified by treatments, including hormonal or taxane therapies. ATM- and BRCA2-mutated tumors exhibited differences in co-occurring molecular features. These unique molecular features may inform therapeutic decisions and development of novel therapies.","AbstractAlthough immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness is correlated with intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression, there are no clinically available methods to improve sensitivity to ICIs by modulating PD-L1 expression. mRNA vaccines stimulate robust interferon-dependent innate immune activation leading to four-fold increases in PD-L1 expression on peripheral and intratumoral myeloid cells and enhanced sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade in preclinical models (Sayour, Grippin, and others, NanoLetters, 2018; Mendez-Gomez, and others, Cell, 2024). We hypothesized that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-COV-2 would similarly enhance PD-L1 expression in intracranial tumors. To test this hypothesis, we utilized institutional databases to identify 5,524 patients at our institution with pathology reports including the term “PD-L1” from August 2020 to November 2023. Pathological data and dates of SARS-COV-2 vaccination were compiled for each patient. Across the entire cohort (n=5,524), receipt of a SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of biopsy was associated with a 55% increase in mean tumor proportion score (TPS) (14% vs 8.9%, p=0.029). In the subset of patients with intracranial tumors (n=187), receipt of a SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of biopsy was associated with a massive increase in TPS (57% vs 7.2%, p<0.001). To evaluate the impact of this change on clinical outcomes with immunotherapy, we utilized a second institutional database to assemble a cohort of patients with Stage IV melanoma with intracranial metastasis treated with immune checkpoint blockade during the period August 2020 through November 2023. Patients who received a SARS-COV-2 vaccine within 100 days of initiation of ICI (n=10) exhibited numerically improved overall survival compared to those without SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine (n=38) (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22-1.2, p=0.06). Median overall survival was 545 days among patients without COVID mRNA vaccination and was not met among those with COVID mRNA vaccination. This data supports further investigation of the immune modulating effect of SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with intracranial tumors treated with immune checkpoint blockade.",0
"Aim: This cohort study evaluated the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and mortality as well as ICI discontinuation among older adults with NSCLC.Methods: 2007–2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database was used and survival analysis with time-varying exposure of irAEs was applied to estimate the associations.Results & conclusion: A total of 8,175 individuals were included, with 46.8% of whom developed an irAE. Cox regression models showed the occurrence of any irAEs was associated with increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.63–1.82) and treatment discontinuation (HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.78–1.97). Some variability was observed in the effect on the two outcomes depending on the type of irAE.","AbstractBackgroundThis investigator-initiated phase II trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (CaboNivoIpi) in previously treated patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.MethodsEligible patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who progressed on 1 prior line of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy received a 2-week run-in of cabozantinib monotherapy followed by CaboNivoIpi for 4 cycles (cycle length = 6 weeks), followed by cabozantinib plus nivolumab (cycle length = 4 weeks) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) within the first 6 months of treatment. A Simon optimal 2-stage design allowed for an interim analysis after accrual of 10 evaluable patients. At least 5 responses were needed to proceed to stage 2.ResultsAmong 11 patients enrolled, the median age was 69 years. Prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapies included lenvatinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib plus everolimus. Median follow-up was 13.4 months. Among 10 evaluable patients, ORR within the first 6 months of treatment was 10% (1 partial response). Median progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI, 3.0–not reached) and median overall survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 4.6–not reached). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were noted in 55% (6/11) and grade 5 AEs in 18% (2/11) of patients. The most common treatment-related AE was hypertension. The study did not reach its prespecified efficacy threshold.ConclusionCaboNivoIpi had low ORRs and a high rate of grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs.Clinical Trial RegistrationNCT03914300",1
"Purpose:Low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer is a chronic illness commonly treated by repetitive transurethral resection of bladder tumor. We compared the efficacy and safety of intravesical chemoablation with UGN-102 (a reverse thermal gel containing mitomycin), with or without subsequent transurethral resection of bladder tumor, to transurethral resection of bladder tumor alone in patients with low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.Materials and Methods:This prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial recruited patients with new or recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer to receive initial treatment with either UGN-102 once weekly for 6 weeks or transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Patients were followed quarterly by endoscopy, cytology, and for-cause biopsy. The primary end point was disease-free survival. All patients were followed for adverse events.Results:Trial enrollment was halted by the sponsor to pursue an alternative development strategy after 282 of a planned 632 patients were randomized to UGN-102 ± subsequent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (n=142) or transurethral resection of bladder tumor monotherapy (n=140), rendering the trial underpowered to perform hypothesis testing. Patients were predominantly male and ≥65 years of age. Tumor-free complete response 3 months after initial treatment was achieved by 92 patients (65%) who received UGN-102 and 89 patients (64%) treated by transurethral resection of bladder tumor. The estimated probability of disease-free survival 15 months after randomization was 72% for UGN-102 ± transurethral resection of bladder tumor and 50% for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (hazard ratio 0.45). The most common adverse events (incidence ≥10%) in the UGN-102 group were dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and pollakiuria.Conclusions:Primary, nonsurgical chemoablation with UGN-102 for the management of low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer offers a potential therapeutic alternative to immediate transurethral resection of bladder tumor monotherapy and warrants further investigation.","ABSTRACTBackgroundCancer is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Survivorship is increasing, bringing new challenges. Cancer treatment, including chemotherapeutic drugs, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, can have severe and impactful gastrointestinal side effects occurring shortly after treatment (acute toxicity) or persisting for years after treatment ends (late/chronic toxicity).PurposeThe aim of this article is to review the neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy on the enteric nervous system (ENS) and the gut extrinsic innervation. These effects could contribute to the development of long‐term gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Research, primarily conducted in animal models, indicates that antitumoral drugs can lead to chemotherapy‐induced enteric neuropathy (CIEN). Studies, mainly performed in the myenteric plexus, show that CIEN is characterized by a reduced density of nerve cells and fibers, as well as an imbalanced representation of neuronal subpopulations or their markers, with enteric glial cells also affected.These alterations underlie changes in neuronal activity and gastrointestinal motor function. Although research on the submucosal plexus remains limited, evidence suggests that CIEN affects the entire ENS. Furthermore, scarce studies show that CIEN also occurs in humans. Moreover, emerging experimental data on chemotherapy‐induced alterations in visceral sensitivity suggest that the extrinsic innervation of the gut is also affected, but this has received little attention thus far. Nevertheless, this could contribute to the development of chemotherapy‐induced brain–gut axis (BGA) disorders in the long term. Cancer chemotherapy (and probably also immunotherapy and radiotherapy) seems to cause neuropathic effects on the intrinsic and extrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract, with an important impact on gastrointestinal and BGA functions. This is a relatively neglected area deserving further investigation.",0
"BackgroundTrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells and many malignant tumor cells. However, data on TROP2 expression in advanced lung cancer are insufficient, and its changes have not been fully evaluated.MethodsWe assessed the prevalence and changes in TROP2 expression in patients with lung cancer who received anti-cancer treatments using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with an anti-TROP2 antibody (clone: SP295). IHC scores were graded from 0 to 3; grade ≥ 2 was considered positive for TROP2 expression. We defined a difference in IHC score, before and after anti-cancer treatments, as the change in TROP2 expression.ResultsBefore anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 89% (143/160) of the patients and was significantly more common in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma than in neuroendocrine carcinoma (P < 0.001). After anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 87% (139/160) of the patients. The distribution of TROP2 expression in post-treatment samples was analogous to that in pre-treatment samples when compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P = 0.509). However, an increase in TROP2 expression was seen in 19 (12%), and a decrease in 20 (13%) patients. Patients treated with targeted therapy showed significantly higher changes in TROP2 expression (P = 0.019) and thoracic radiotherapy was more likely to increase TROP2 expression than chemotherapy alone.ConclusionAlthough some anti-cancer treatments might alter the TROP2 expression, TROP2 was expressed in most lung cancer specimens before and after anti-cancer treatments. These results support the development of TROP2-directed therapy against advanced lung cancer in various treatment lines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03784-3.","PurposeTo investigate the prognostic value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).MethodsThe medical records of HCC patients treated with SBRT between 2008 and 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. The NLR and PLR were calculated from the serum complete blood count before and after SBRT, and the prognostic values of the NLR and PLR for the treatment outcomes were evaluated.ResultsThirty-nine patients with 49 HCC lesions were included. After a median follow-up of 26.8 months (range, 8.4-80.0 months), three-year local control, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 97.4%, 78.3%, and 35.2%, respectively. Both NLR and PLR increased significantly after SBRT and decreased slowly to the pre-SBRT value at 6 months. Univariable analysis showed that gross tumor volume (GTV) >14 cc, post-SBRT PLR >90, and PLR change >30 were associated with a poorer OS (p=0.002, p=0.011, and p=0.001, respectively), and the PLR change was significant in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 10.09; 95% CI, 1.15-88.40; p=0.037). For PFS, GTV >14 cc, post-SBRT NLR >2.5 and post-SBRT PLR >90 were predictive of a poorer PFS in univariable analysis (p=0.011, p=0.004 and p=0.041, respectively) and only post-SBRT NLR >2.5 remained significant in multivariable analysis (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.03-5.76; p=0.042, respectively).ConclusionsThe NLR and PLR increased transiently after SBRT, and the post-SBRT NLR and PLR were associated with the clinical outcomes of HCC patients.",0
"BackgroundDespite advances in precision medicine for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), biomarker testing for these therapies remains frequently underused, delayed, and inequitable. Pulmonologists often play a critical role in the initial diagnostic steps for patients with lung cancer, and previous data show variability in their knowledge and practices regarding biomarker testing. The purpose of this study is to better understand how pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care.Research QuestionWith the increasing importance of biomarker testing and precision medicine, how do pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care?Study DesignAn electronic survey consisting of 31 items focused on attitudes and practices regarding diagnostic steps for NSCLC was randomly distributed to a sample of practicing pulmonologists in the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) analytics database. Inferential statistics were performed using χ2 tests and multivariable logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 401 pulmonologists responded to the survey. Most (92%) were general pulmonologists, and more than one-half (62%) indicated they order biomarker testing. Longer practice tenure, higher case volumes, and participation in a multidisciplinary tumor board were associated with ordering biomarkers (P < .05). Pulmonology was identified to have the leading responsibility for the initial diagnostic biopsy by most respondents (83%) and less often for staging (45%), leading discussions about biomarker testing with patients (28%), and for ordering biomarkers (22%). The most common reasons for not ordering biomarkers included the following: oncology was responsible (84%), it was not within their scope of practice (46%), or lack of the necessary knowledge (51%).InterpretationThis study shows that pulmonologists vary in their practices for ordering biomarkers, and many defer this responsibility to oncology. Despite the role of bronchoscopy and pulmonology societal guidelines for staging, many defer leadership of this process. Many pulmonologists lack the necessary resources and multidisciplinary infrastructure likely required to efficiently accomplish biomarker testing.","In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether anlotinib reverses osimertinib resistance by inhibiting the formation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. In a clinical case, anlotinib reversed osimertinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analyses on tumor tissues from three NSCLC patients with osimertinib resistance to analyze alterations in the expression levels of EMT markers and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) before and after the development of osimertinib resistance. The results revealed the downregulation of E-cadherin, coupled with the upregulation of vimentin and VEGFA in tumor tissues of patients exhibiting osimertinib resistance, compared with those in tissues from patients before receiving osimertinib. Subsequently, we established osimertinib-resistant (Osi-R) cell lines and found that the Osi-R cells acquired EMT features. Next, we analyzed the synergistic effects of the combination therapy to verify whether anlotinib could reverse osimertinib resistance by inhibiting EMT. The expression levels of VEGFA and tube formation were analyzed in the combination group in vitro. Finally, we determined the reversal of osimertinib resistance by the combination of osimertinib and anlotinib in vivo using 20 nude mice. The combined treatment of osimertinib and anlotinib effectively prevented the metastasis of Osi-R cells, inhibited tumor growth, exerted antitumor activity, and ultimately reversed osimertinib resistance in mice. The co-administration of osimertinib and anlotinib demonstrated synergistic efficacy in inhibiting EMT and angiogenesis in three NSCLC patients, ultimately reversing osimertinib resistance.",1
"BackgroundRecent studies have shown that lysosomes not only provide energy for tumor cell growth, but also participate in the occurrence and development of malignant tumors by regulating various ways of tumor cell death. However, the role of lysosome associated genes (LSAGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.MethodsTranscriptome data and clinical data of HCC were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases. We identified differential expression of LSAGs by comparing tumor tissue with normal liver tissue. Subsequently, we used univariate COX analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) COX regression to construct the prognostic feature of LSAGs. Kaplan–Meier survival curve and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to evaluate the predictive ability of LSAGs feature. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used for functional enrichment analysis of risk differential genes. The relationship between LSAGs score and tumor microenvironment and chemotherapy drug sensitivity was analyzed. Finally, the cellular communication of tumor cells with high and low expression of model LSAGs was explored.ResultsWe identified sixteen prognostic associated LSAGs, four of which were selected to construct prognostic feature of LSAGs. Patients in the low LSAGs group had a better prognosis than those in the high LSAGs group. GO and KEGG analyses showed that risk differential genes were enriched in leukocyte migration, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The group with low LSAGs score had lower immune score. Patients in the high LSAGs group were more sensitive to drugs for chemotherapy. In addition, tumor cells with high expression of model LSAGs showed stronger association with immune cells through the interleukin-2 (IL2), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), adiponectin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signaling pathways.ConclusionWe established a LSAGs signature that had the ability to predict clinical prognosis and immune landscape, proposing potential therapeutic targets for HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05477-5.","BackgroundLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer, and comprehending its molecular mechanisms is pivotal for advancing treatment efficacy. This study aims to explore the prognostic and functional significance of base excision repair (BER)-related long non-coding RNAs (BERLncs) in LUAD.MethodsA risk score model for BERLncs was developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and Cox regression analysis. Model validation and prognostic evaluation were performed using Kaplan–Meier and receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to elucidate the potential biological functions of BERLncs. Comparative analyses were carried out to investigate disparities in tumor mutation burden (TMB), immune infiltration, tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score, chemosensitivity, and immune checkpoint gene expression between the two risk groups.ResultsA predictive risk score model comprising 19 BERLncs was successfully developed. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the median risk score. The high-risk subgroup exhibited significantly inferior overall survival. Functional enrichment analysis revealed pathways associated with lung cancer development, notably the neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction pathway. High-risk patients demonstrated elevated TMB, diminished TIDE scores, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, while low-risk patients displayed potential benefits from immunotherapy. Additionally, the risk model identified potential anticancer agents.ConclusionThe risk score model based on BERLncs shows promise as a prognostic biomarker for LUAD patients, providing valuable insights for clinical decision-making, therapeutic strategies, and understanding of underlying biological mechanisms.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05435-1.",1
"Despite the notable efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, resistance in most individuals necessitates additional investigation. For this study, we collected tumor tissues from nine HCC patients receiving anti-PD1 monotherapy and conducted RNA sequencing. These findings revealed significant upregulation of GSDME, which is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in anti-PD1-resistant patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated levels of GSDME+ macrophages in HCC tissues presented a poorer prognosis. The analysis of single-cell sequencing data and flow cytometry revealed that the suppression of GSDME expression in nontumor cells resulted in a decrease in the proportion of M2-like macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TIME) of HCC while concurrently augmenting the cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells. The non-N-terminal fragment of GSDME within macrophages combines with PDPK1, thereby activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and facilitating M2-like polarization. The small-molecule Eliprodil inhibited the increase in PDPK1 phosphorylation mediated by GSDME site 1. The combination of Eliprodil and anti-PD1 was effective in the treatment of both spontaneous HCC in c-Myc + /+;Alb-Cre + /+ mice and in a hydrodynamic tail vein injection model, which provides a promising strategy for novel combined immunotherapy.","ABSTRACTAimsTo investigate mechanism of lncRNA SNHG12 induced macrophage-myofibroblast transition (MMT) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodCAFs EVs were isolated from human NSCLC tissue and adjacent cancerous tissue (n = 3), and their morphology and particle size were evaluated. Macrophages and MMT cells with different phenotypes were detected, and the binding relationship of lncRNA SNHG12, miR-181a-5p, and Smad3 was verified.ResultLncRNA SNHG12 derived from CAFs-EVs promoted the transformation of M2 macrophages into MMT.

"ResumenEl cáncer colorrectal (CCR) es uno de los más frecuentes y letales en México y el mundo. Es de resaltar que, a nivel global, la incidencia del CCR aumenta a razón del 2% anual en pacientes menores de 50 años. Su detección temprana, basada principalmente en la colonoscopia a partir de los 45 años, es una de las armas más importantes en la clínica para disminuir su mortalidad. Cuando la neoplasia está presente, la piedra angular en el tratamiento es la cirugía, sin embargo, factores pronósticos señalados en los reportes de patología y la investigación biomédica del microambiente tumoral pueden ofrecer nuevos parámetros que sirvan como biomarcadores de pronóstico y predicción. En este sentido, señalar la presencia o ausencia de células de la respuesta inmune comienza a dar indicios de su relevancia pronóstica. Si bien este campo es aún controversial, nuestras evidencias recientes indican que la presencia de neutrófilos con un fenotipo antitumoral, particularmente en el margen invasivo de tumores del colon, podría ser un indicativo de buen pronóstico. Esta información emergente sugiere que la descripción de las características de las células de la respuesta inmune, en particular la de los neutrófilos, podría contribuir a evaluar la evolución del CCR y a identificar a los pacientes con mayor riesgo de recurrencias. En este artículo, discutimos algunos puntos relevantes que deben ser abordados al momento de la interpretación de la información relacionada con los neutrófilos en el contexto del CCR.","ABSTRACTAimsTo study programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.MethodsThe study included samples from 50 early-stage NSCLCs. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides (clone SP263) were scored manually and with two different AI tools (PathAI and Navify Digital Pathology) by three pathologists. TILs were digitally assessed on H&E and CD8 IHC stained sections with two different algorithms (PathAI and Navify Digital Pathology, respectively). The agreement between observers and methods for each biomarker was analysed. For PD-L1, the turn-around time (TAT) for manual versus AI-assisted scoring was recorded.ResultsAgreement was higher in tumours with low PD-L1 expression regardless of the approach. Both AI-powered tools identified a significantly higher number of cases equal or above 1% PD-L1 tumour proportion score as compared with manual scoring (p=0.00015), a finding with potential therapeutic implications. Regarding TAT, there were significant differences between manual scoring and AI use (p value <0.0001 for all comparisons). The total TILs density with the PathAI algorithm and the total density of CD8+ cells with the Navify Digital Pathology software were significantly correlated (τ=0.49 (95% CI 0.37, 0.61), p value<0.0001).ConclusionsThis preliminary study supports the use of AI algorithms for the scoring of PD-L1 and TILs in patients with NSCLC.",1
"Plain Language SummaryPatients with both BRAF V600E mutations and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have poor prognosis. Currently, there are no specifically targeted first-line treatment options indicated for patients with mCRC whose tumors harbor both molecular aberrations. Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of MSI-H/dMMR mCRC, and the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib, in combination with cetuximab, is approved for previously treated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. Combination of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab may synergistically enhance antitumor activity in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR mCRC. SEAMARK is a randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab versus pembrolizumab alone in patients with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR mCRC.Plain language summary – SEAMARK study: encorafenib & cetuximab plus pembrolizumab for people with BRAF V600E-mutant & DNA repair-deficient colorectal cancerColorectal cancer (CRC) occurs when there is an abnormal growth of cells (known as a tumor) in the colon or rectum. Some people with CRC have changes in their tumor genes (known as gene mutations). A gene is a piece of DNA that tells the cell to make specific molecules, such as proteins. Mutations in a gene called BRAF can turn on signals that help the cancer cells grow. Gene mutations that impair DNA repair mechanisms can also make the cancer cells grow more quickly and allow the immune system to detect the cancer cells as being foreign to the body. Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that turns off specific genes and proteins involved in cancer cell survival and growth. BRAF and EGFR inhibitors are targeted therapies that work well together in treating people with BRAF-mutant CRC. BRAF proteins can help cancer cells grow, and BRAF inhibitors block these proteins to prevent, slow, or stop the growth of the cancer cells. Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps a person’s immune system fight cancer. Immunotherapy is effective for treating CRC that has mutations in the DNA repair mechanisms. By combining targeted therapy and immunotherapy, patients may be able to live longer without their disease getting worse. In the SEAMARK study, we will use a treatment combination including a BRAF inhibitor (encorafenib), an EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab) and an immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) in patients with CRC who have a BRAF mutation and deficiencies in the DNA repair mechanism.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05217446 (ClinicalTrials.gov), 2021-003715-26 (EudraCT) Tweetable abstract SEAMARK (NCT05217446) is a phase II study investigating the efficacy of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.","BackgroundIn CLEAR, lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (L+P) significantly improved efficacy versus sunitinib in first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We report results from CLEAR biomarker analyses.MethodsPD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing assays (whole exome sequencing/RNA-sequencing) were performed on archival tumor specimens.For IHC-derived/RNA-sequencing analyses, a continuous analysis was performed adjusting by Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score for: PD-L1 CPS versus best overall response (BOR)/PFS; and each gene-signature score (T-cell inflamed gene-expression profile [TcellinfGEP]/non-TcellinfGEP signatures including proliferation and angiogenesis) versus BOR/PFS.Association between mutation status of RCC driver genes and PFS were analyzed for genes for which ≥20 patients per arm had oncogenic alterations. Association of molecular subtypes with outcome was evaluated with baseline KPS adjustments. The set of biomarkers evaluated and statistical significance criteria for PD-L1 CPS, gene signature scores, and molecular subtypes were pre-specified.ResultsWithin-arm analyses using continuous values showed no association between PD-L1 levels and BOR/PFS for either treatment.PFS hazard ratios between arms were similar regardless of mutant or wildtype subgroups of RCC driver genes (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, KDM5C).No associations between PFS and gene-signature scores were observed for L+P. With sunitinib, high proliferation and MYC signature scores showed shorter PFS; high angiogenesis and microvessel density signature scores showed longer PFS.Six new molecular subtypes were defined. Tumors of patients with favorable/intermediate risk were enriched in angiogenesis and angiogenesis/stromal clusters; those with poor risk were enriched in proliferative and unclassified (low-TcellinfGEP/low-angiogenesis/low-proliferation) clusters. No association between molecular subtypes and PFS for L+P/sunitinib was observed (after adjustment for KPS and gene signatures that were individually associated with PFS).ConclusionsImprovements in ORR and PFS for L+P versus sunitinib in aRCC were observed consistently across a range of biomarker subgroups defined using RCC driver mutations, PD-L1, gene expression signatures, and molecular subtypes.",1
"Antibody inhibitors pose an ongoing challenge to the treatment of subjects with inherited protein deficiency disorders, limiting the efficacy of both protein replacement therapy and corrective gene therapy. Beyond their central role as producers of serum antibody, B cells also exhibit many unique properties that could be exploited in cell therapy applications, notably including antigen-specific recognition and the linked capacity for antigen presentation. Here we employed CRISPR-Cas9 to demonstrate that ex vivo antigen-primed Blimp1-knockout “decoy” B cells, incapable of differentiation into plasma cells, participated in and downregulated host antigen-specific humoral responses after adoptive transfer. Following ex vivo antigen pulse, adoptively transferred high-affinity antigen-specific decoy B cells were diverted into germinal centers en masse, thereby reducing participation by endogenous antigen-specific B cells in T-dependent humoral responses and suppressing both cognate and linked antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G following immunization with conjugated antigen. This effect was dose-dependent and, importantly, did not impact concurrent unrelated antibody responses. We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of this approach by treating factor VIII (FVIII)-knockout mice with antigen-pulsed decoy B cells prior to immunization with an FVIII conjugate protein, thereby blunting the production of serum FVIII-specific IgG by an order of magnitude as well as reducing the proportion of animals exhibiting functional FVIII inhibition by 6-fold.","Immunoglobulin G 3 (IgG3) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are high-value scaffolds for developing novel therapies. Despite their wide-ranging therapeutic potential, IgG3 physicochemical properties and developability characteristics remain largely under-characterized. Protein–protein interactions elevate solution viscosity in high-concentration formulations, impacting physicochemical stability, manufacturability, and the injectability of mAbs. Therefore, in this manuscript, the key molecular descriptors and biophysical properties of a model anti-IL-8 IgG1 and its IgG3 ortholog are characterized. A computational and experimental framework was applied to measure molecular descriptors impacting their downstream developability. Findings from this approach underpin a detailed understanding of the molecular characteristics of IgG3 mAbs as potential therapeutic entities. This work is the first report examining the manufacturability of IgG3 for high-concentration mAb formulations. While poorer conformational and colloidal stability and elevated solution viscosity were observed for IgG3, future efforts controlling surface potential through sequence-engineering of solvent-accessible patches can be used to improve biophysical parameters that dictate mAb developability.",1
"PurposeDue to the rarity of primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL), the prognostic factors and optimal management of PGIL have not been clearly defined. We aimed to establish prognostic models using a deep learning algorithm for survival prediction.MethodsWe collected 11,168 PGIL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to form the training and test cohorts. At the same time, we collected 82 PGIL patients from three medical centres to form the external validation cohort. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model, random survival forest (RSF) model, and neural multitask logistic regression (DeepSurv) model to predict PGIL patients’ overall survival (OS).ResultsThe 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of PGIL patients in the SEER database were 77.1%, 69.4%, 63.7%, and 50.3%, respectively. The RSF model based on all variables showed that the top three most important variables for predicting OS were age, histological type, and chemotherapy. The independent risk factors for PGIL patient prognosis included sex, age, race, primary site, Ann Arbor stage, histological type, symptom, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, according to the Lasso regression analysis. Using these factors, we built the CoxPH and DeepSurv models. The DeepSurv model’s C-index values were 0.760 in the training cohort, 0.742 in the test cohort, and 0.707 in the external validation cohort, which demonstrated that the DeepSurv model performed better compared to the RSF model (0.728) and the CoxPH model (0.724). The DeepSurv model accurately predicted 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year OS. Both calibration curves and decision curve analysis curves demonstrated the superior performance of the DeepSurv model. We developed the DeepSurv model as an online web calculator for survival prediction, which can be accessed at  DeepSurv model with external validation is superior to previous studies in predicting short-term and long-term survival and can help us make better-individualized decisions for PGIL patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05123-0.","PurposeSkin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive melanocytic carcinoma whose high heterogeneity and complex etiology make its prognosis difficult to predict. This study aimed to construct a risk subtype typing model for SKCM.MethodsThe study proposes a deep learning framework combining early fusion feature autoencoder (AE) and late fusion feature AE for risk subtype prediction of SKCM. The deep learning framework integrates mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data of SKCM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and clusters the screened multi-omics features associated with survival prognosis to identify risk subtypes. Differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis were performed between risk subtypes, while SVM classifiers were constructed between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression screening and risk subtype labels inferred from multi-omics data, and the predictive robustness of risk subtypes inferred from the risk subtype classification prediction model was validated using two independent datasets.ResultsThe deep learning framework that combined early fusion feature AE with late fusion feature AE distinguished the two best risk subtypes compared to the multi-omics integration approach with single strategy AE or PCA. A promising C-index (C-index = 0.748) and a significant difference in survival (log-rank P value = 4.61 × 10–9) were found between the identified risk subtypes. The DEGs with the top significance values together with differentially expressed miRNAs provided the biological interpretation of risk subtypes on SKCM. Finally, the framework was applied to predict risk subtypes in two independent test datasets of SKCM patients, all of which showed good predictive power (C-index > 0.680) and significant survival differences (log-rank P value < 0.01).ConclusionThe SKCM risk subtypes identified by integrating multi-omics data based on deep learning can not only improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SKCM, but also provide clinicians with assistance in treatment decisions.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05358-x.",1
The COSMIC-313 phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) tested the triplet combination of cabozantinib with nivolumab and ipilimumab in comparison with nivolumab plus ipilimumab control as fist-line systemic therapy in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The first results presented at the 2022 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress are a milestone for the renal cell carcinoma field because they signal the advent of triplet combinations as potential treatment options for our patients. The present commentary highlights some considerations and potential next steps based on these first impressions.,"ABSTRACTAging presents a significant challenge to health and social care systems due to the increasing proportion of the elderly population. The identification of reliable biomarkers to assess the progression of aging remains an unresolved question. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded covalently closed RNAs. They have been found to regulate various biological processes. CircRNAs are present in human biological fluids, are relatively stable, and accumulate with age, making them promising as biomarkers of aging. Current information on the expression of circRNAs in aging was analyzed using scientific databases. In this review, we have identified key stages in the study of circRNAs during aging and summarized the current understanding of their biogenesis. By focusing on the role of circRNAs in processes that contribute to aging – such as genomic stability, metabolism, cell death, and signaling pathways – we hypothesize that circRNAs may drive the aging process through their age-related accumulation and resultant deregulation. Examples of age-related differential expression of circRNAs in various species, including humans, are provided. This review highlights the importance of finding novel epigenetic biomarkers of aging, beyond the already identified molecules (circFOXO3, circRNA100783, circPVT1), and highlights circRNAs as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of age-associated diseases.",0
"AbstractTherapies shown to improve outcomes in patients with recurrent cancers are commonly used in the neoadjuvant setting to optimize surgery, reduce radiation fields, and treat micrometastatic disease. While the use of pre-radiation chemotherapy (PRC) has flourished in systemic cancers, it has not seen the same level of use in glioblastomas. This review documents these trajectories and highlights the potential of PRC to rapidly and safely screen cytotoxic drugs for efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.Prospective trials of adults with newly diagnosed systemic and brain cancers treated with PRC published between 1980 and 2023 were identified in PubMed. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were used to document the standard use of PRC in patients with systemic and brain cancers.Over 5000 prospective PRC trials in solid tumors were identified. These accrued >1 million patients and resulted in neoadjuvant therapies being the standard of care in ~28 systemic cancers. Only 50 similar trials (2206 patients) were identified in high-grade gliomas. In 13 trials containing PRC temozolomide (n = 846), radiographic responses ranged from 6 to 53% with a median survival of ~13 months. Glioblastoma PRC trials were not associated with unexpected toxicities or major negative impacts on survival. Pre-radiation chemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma appears safe and feasible. The pre-radiation window is ideally suited to rapidly screen cytotoxic agents for efficacy. It permits radiographic response as a primary outcome, small sample sizes, and initiation of standard therapies a few months after diagnosis. Pre-radiation chemotherapy may be most appropriate for patients with glioblastoma who are unlikely to benefit from temozolomide.","AbstractOver recent decades, in vitro and in vivo models have significantly advanced brain cancer research; however, each presents distinct challenges for accurately mimicking in situ conditions. In response, organotypic slice cultures have emerged as a promising model recapitulating precisely specific in vivo phenotypes through an ex vivo approach. Ex vivo organotypic brain slice models can integrate biological relevance and patient-specific variability early in drug discovery, thereby aiming for more precise treatment stratification. However, the challenges of obtaining representative fresh brain tissue, ensuring reproducibility, and maintaining essential central nervous system (CNS)-specific conditions reflecting the in situ situation over time have limited the direct application of ex vivo organotypic slice cultures in robust clinical trials. In this review, we explore the benefits and possible limitations of ex vivo organotypic brain slice cultures in neuro-oncological research. Additionally, we share insights from clinical experts in neuro-oncology on how to overcome these current limitations and improve the practical application of organotypic brain slice cultures beyond academic research.",1
"Introduction:Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown great promise in a wide spectrum of malignancies. However, responses are not always durable, and this mode of treatment is only effective in a subset of patients. As such, there exists an unmet need for novel approaches to bolster ICI efficacy.Areas covered:We review the role of the Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinases in promoting tumor-induced immune suppression and discuss the benefits that may be derived from combining ICI with TAM kinase-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We searched the MEDLINE Public Library of Medicine (PubMed) and EMBASE databases and referred to ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant ongoing studies.Expert Opinion:Targeting of TAM kinases may improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. However, it remains to be determined whether this effect will be better achieved by the selective targeting of each TAM receptor, depending on the context, or by multi-receptor TAM inhibitors. Triple inhibition of all TAM receptors is more likely to be associated with increased risk for adverse events. Clinical trial designs should use high resolution clinical endpoints and proper control arms to determine the synergistic effects of combining TAM inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade.","AbstractINTRODUCTIONDespite aggressive interventions, Glioblastoma (GBM) remains as a challenge for neuro-oncologists. Standard treatments are often followed by disease recurrence. Adoptive cell therapies have emerged as a viable therapeutic for brain malignancies. CAR-T cell therapy has generated substantial interest because of its efficacy and specificity in treating various cancers. Despite these efficacies, studies reveal limitations of CAR-T therapy due to the altered metabolic environment in GBM. GBM tumors shift towards aerobic glycolysis, regardless of oxygen availability leading to massive glucose consumption. This results in impeding T-cell glycolysis and activation. OBJECTIVEThe GBM microenvironment provides local restraints via metabolic competition suppressing antitumor immunity, specifically inhibiting infiltration and tumoricidal functions of host and adoptively transferred tumor-reactive T-cells. In our study, we manipulated the metabolic fitness of the therapeutic T-cells to enhance their tumoricidal activity, by overexpressing glucose transporter GLUT1 and GLUT3. We show that this manipulation can enhance their anti-tumor activity. METHODSThe T-cell glucose metabolic pathway was modulated via glucose transporter overexpression. The functionality of metabolically modified T-cells was investigated in murine and human models. RESULTSWe demonstrated that tumor cells impose glucose restriction when competing for glucose with T-cells leading to T-cell hypo responsiveness. Overexpression of glucose transporters such as Glut1 and Glut3 increased T-cell glucose utilization and provide survival advantage leading to enhanced T-cell activation in glucose-restricted conditions. The metabolic modifications regulate T-cell efficacy by enhancing intra-tumoral trafficking. We tested this approach in the context of CD70CAR T cell therapy. It was established that glucose transporter overexpression in CD70 CAR T-cells not only improves intracranial tumor invasion but also elicit functional anti-tumor cell response thus improving survival. CONCLUSIONSThis study integrates fundamental concepts of tumor and immune metabolism in the design of immunotherapy and confirms that immunometabolism represents a viable target for new cancer therapy to treat brain tumors.",0
"Background:To develop machine learning (ML) models predicting unplanned readmission and reoperation among patients undergoing free flap reconstruction for head and neck (HN) surgery.Methods:Data were extracted from the 2012–2019 NSQIP database. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to develop ML models predicting 30-day readmission and reoperation based on demographic and perioperative factors. Models were validated using 2019 data and evaluated.Results:Four-hundred and sixty-six (10.7%) of 4333 included patients were read-mitted within 30 days of initial surgery. The ML model demonstrated 82% accuracy, 63% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and AUC of 0.78. Nine-hundred and four (18.3%) of 4931 patients underwent reoperation within 30 days of index surgery. The ML model demonstrated 62% accuracy, 51% sensitivity, 64% specificity, and AUC of 0.58.Conclusion:XGBoost was used to predict 30-day readmission and reoperation for HN free flap patients. Findings may be used to assist clinicians and patients in shared decision-making and improve data collection in future database iterations.","Host defense against viral pathogens is an essential function for all living organisms. In cell-intrinsic innate immunity, dedicated sensor proteins recognize molecular signatures of infection and communicate to downstream adaptor or effector proteins to activate immune defense. Remarkably, recent evidence demonstrates that much of the core machinery of innate immunity is shared across eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains of life. Here, we review a pioneering example of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity: the animal cGAS-STING signaling pathway and its ancestor in bacteria, CBASS anti-phage defense. We discuss the unique mechanism by which animal cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) and bacterial CD-NTases in these pathways link pathogen detection with immune activation using nucleotide second messenger signals. Comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we highlight emerging questions in the field and examine evolutionary pressures that may have shaped the origins of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense.",0
"BackgroundExosomes are extracellular nanometric vesicles used by cells to communicate with each other. They are responsible for many pathological conditions, including tumors by transferring regulatory biomolecules that impact target cell activity. Because of their high concentration in exosomes compared with parental cells and the rest of exosomal content, specificity to the cell of origin, and their well-organized sorting mechanism, microRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to be the most potent exosomes cargo and used by scientists to track exosomes and to detect cell activity changes and prognosis in cancer early.PurposeIn this review, the results of studies examining the role of exosomes in cancer pathophysiology and their clinical potential are discussed in detail.Summary of the FindingsTumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) mediate the dynamic changes of cancer growth and invasion, including local microenvironment remodeling, distance metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor-associated immunosuppression. They also contribute to hypoxia-induced tumor progression and cancer cell drug resistance. As a result of exosomes being present in all body fluids, it is possible to have early accessible and less-invasive diagnostic and prognostic measures by forming a table for each cancer type and its matched specific miRNAs. Under testing, available therapeutic uses of exosomes include interference of exosomes biogenesis, secretion, or uptake, and recruitment of exosomes as target-specific drug delivery vehicles, and immunostimulatory agents for both cancer patients and healthy population to avoid cancer development from the start.ConclusionThese data suggest that exosomes and exosomal microRNA are directly related to cancer progression mechanisms, and could be used in cancer early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.","Exosomes continue to attract interest as a promising nanocarrier drug delivery technology. They are naturally derived nanoscale extracellular vesicles with innate properties well suited to shuttle proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. Nonetheless, their clinical utility is currently limited by several major challenges, such as their inability to target tumor cells and a high proportion of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) of the liver and spleen. To overcome these limitations, we developed “Smart Exosomes” that co-display RGD and CD47p110–130 through CD9 engineering (ExoSmart). The resultant ExoSmart demonstrates enhanced binding capacity to αvβ3 on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, resulting in amplified cellular uptake in in vitro and in vivo models and increased chemotherapeutic efficacies. Simultaneously, ExoSmart significantly reduced liver and spleen clearance of exosomes by inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis via CD47p110–130 interaction with signal regulatory proteins (SIRPα) on macrophages. These studies demonstrate that an engineered exosome drug delivery system increases PDAC therapeutic efficacy by enhancing active PDAC targeting and prolonging circulation times, and their findings hold tremendous translational potential for cancer therapy while providing a concrete foundation for future work utilizing novel peptide-engineered exosome strategies.",1
"Objectives:To determine the clinical predictors of response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival to pembrolizumab in advanced or recurrent, mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) or Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) endometrial adenocarcinomas.Methods:A retrospective, single institution study was conducted among women with recurrent or advanced MMRd or MSI-H endometrial adenocarcinomas treated with single-agent pembrolizumab at our institution from 2017 to 2021. Logistic regression was used for univariable and multivariable analyses. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier and modeled via Cox proportional hazards regression. Log-rank test was used for intergroup comparisons based on body mass index (BMI). A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results:Among the 44 patients included in the analysis, the mean age was 64.1 years (range 41–87) and mean BMI was 32.9 (range 18.5–51.8). Mean cycles of pembrolizumab given was 12.8 (range 2–37). Median follow-up was 33 months (range 5–61) with a response rate of 63.6% and stable disease rate of 75%. When stratified by obesity status (BMI>30), disease control rate was 59.8% in patients with a BMI<30 and 85.2% in patients with a BMI≥30 patients (p=0.05). On multivariable analysis, obesity was associated with increased rate of disease control (OR 4.03, 95% CI 1.09, 28) while prior smoking was associated with decreased rate of disease control (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03, 0.85). PFS was significantly increased among patients with a BMI≥30 (p=0.03) but OS was similar (p=0.5)Conclusion:In this retrospective study, obesity is associated with increased rates of disease control and improved PFS in patients treated with single-agent pembrolizumab for recurrent or advanced MMRd or MSI-H endometrial adenocarcinomas.","Although major progress has been made in the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for hematological malignancies, this method is ineffective against solid tumors largely because of the limited infiltration, activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells. To overcome this issue, we engineered CAR-T cells with synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors, which induce local tumor-specific secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading enzymes at the tumor site. SynNotch CAR-T cells achieve precise ECM recognition and robustly kill targeted tumors, with synNotch-induced enzyme production enabling the degradation of components of the tumor ECM. In addition, this regulation strongly increased the infiltration of CAR-T cells and the clearance of solid tumors, resulting in tumor regression without toxicity in vivo. Notably, synNotch CAR-T cells also promoted the persistent activation of CAR-T cells in patient-derived tumor organoids. Thus, we constructed a synthetic T-cell system that increases the infiltration and antitumor function of CAR-T cells, providing a strategy for targeting ECM-rich solid tumors.",0
"Both innate and adaptive immune systems play a crucial role in the pathology of skin diseases. To control these cells, there is a need for transdermal drug delivery systems that can target multiple cell populations at independently tunable rates. Herein, we describe a tissue-adhesive hydrogel system that contains particles capable of regulating the release of small molecule drugs at defined rates. Resiquimod (a macrophage-targeting drug) and palbociclib (a T cell-targeting drug) are encapsulated within two types of silicone particles embedded within the hydrogels. We demonstrate that drug release is mediated by the crosslink density of the particles, which is decoupled from the bulk properties of the hydrogel. We show that this system can be used to sustainably polarize macrophages toward an anti-tumor phenotype in vitro and ex vivo, and that the hydrogels can remain attached to skin explants for several days without generating toxicity. The hydrogel is compatible with standard dermatological procedures and allows transdermal passage of drugs. The multimodal, tunable nature of this system has implications in treating a variety of skin disorders, managing infections, and delivering vaccines.","Mononuclear phagocytes such as monocytes, tissue-specific macrophages and dendritic cells are primary actors in both innate and adaptive immunity. These professional phagocytes can be parasitized by intracellular bacteria, turning them from housekeepers to hiding places and favoring chronic and/or disseminated infection. One of the most infamous is the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB), which is the most pandemic and one of the deadliest diseases with one third of the world’s population infected, and an average of 1.8 million deaths/year worldwide.Here we demonstrate the effective targeting and intracellular delivery of antibiotics to infected macrophages both in vitro and in vivo, using pH sensitive nanoscopic polymersomes made of PMPC-PDPA block copolymer. Polymersomes showed the ability to significantly enhance the efficacy of the antibiotics killing Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and another established intracellular pathogen the Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, they demonstrated to easily access TB-like granuloma tissues - one of the harshest environments to penetrate - in zebrafish models. We thus successfully exploited this targeting for the effective eradication of several intracellular bacteria, including the M. tuberculosis - the etiological agent of human TB.",1
"AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.","AbstractBackgroundBisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor‐kappa B ligand (RANKL)‐inhibitors are amongst the bone‐modifying agents used as supportive treatment in women with breast cancer who do not have bone metastases. These agents aim to reduce bone loss and the risk of fractures. Bisphosphonates have demonstrated survival benefits, particularly in postmenopausal women.ObjectivesTo assess and compare the effects of different bone‐modifying agents as supportive treatment to reduce bone mineral density loss and osteoporotic fractures in women with breast cancer without bone metastases and generate a ranking of treatment options using network meta‐analyses (NMAs).Search methodsWe identified studies by electronically searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase until January 2023. We searched various trial registries and screened abstracts of conference proceedings and reference lists of identified trials.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials comparing different bisphosphonates and RANKL‐inihibitors with each other or against no further treatment or placebo for women with breast cancer without bone metastases.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Outcomes were bone mineral density, quality of life, overall fractures, overall survival and adverse events. We conducted NMAs and generated treatment rankings.Main resultsForty‐seven trials (35,163 participants) fulfilled our inclusion criteria; 34 trials (33,793 participants) could be considered in the NMA (8 different treatment options).Bone mineral densityWe estimated that the bone mineral density of participants with no treatment/placebo measured as total T‐score was ‐1.34. Evidence from the NMA (9 trials; 1166 participants) suggests that treatment with ibandronate (T‐score ‐0.77; MD 0.57, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 1.19) may slightly increase bone mineral density (low certainty) and treatment with zoledronic acid (T‐score ‐0.45; MD 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.16) probably slightly increases bone mineral density compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Risedronate (T‐score ‐1.08; MD 0.26, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.84) may result in little to no difference compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty). We are uncertain whether alendronate (T‐score 2.36; MD 3.70, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 9.41) increases bone mineral density compared to no treatment/placebo (very low certainty).Quality of lifeNo quantitative analyses could be performed for quality of life, as only three studies reported this outcome. All three studies showed only minimal differences between the respective interventions examined.Overall fracture rateWe estimated that 70 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo had fractures. Evidence from the NMA (16 trials; 19,492 participants) indicates that treatment with clodronate or ibandronate (42 of 1000; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.92; 40 of 1000; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.86, respectively) decreases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (high certainty). Denosumab or zoledronic acid (51 of 1000; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.01; 55 of 1000; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11, respectively) probably slightly decreases the number of fractures; and risedronate (39 of 1000; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.16) probably decreases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Pamidronate (106 of 1000; RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.06) probably increases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty).Overall survivalWe estimated that 920 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo survived overall. Evidence from the NMA (17 trials; 30,991 participants) suggests that clodronate (924 of 1000; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17), denosumab (927 of 1000; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.21), ibandronate (915 of 1000; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.34) and zoledronic acid (925 of 1000; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.14) may result in little to no difference regarding overall survival compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty). Additionally, we are uncertain whether pamidronate (905 of 1000; HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.78) decreases overall survival compared to no treatment/placebo (very low certainty).Osteonecrosis of the jawWe estimated that 1 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo developed osteonecrosis of the jaw. Evidence from the NMA (12 trials; 23,527 participants) suggests that denosumab (25 of 1000; RR 24.70, 95% CI 9.56 to 63.83), ibandronate (6 of 1000; RR 5.77, 95% CI 2.04 to 16.35) and zoledronic acid (9 of 1000; RR 9.41, 95% CI 3.54 to 24.99) probably increases the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Additionally, clodronate (3 of 1000; RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.83 to 8.50) may increase the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty).Renal impairmentWe estimated that 14 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo developed renal impairment. Evidence from the NMA (12 trials; 22,469 participants) suggests that ibandronate (28 of 1000; RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.88) probably increases the occurrence of renal impairment compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Zoledronic acid (21 of 1000; RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.58) probably increases the occurrence of renal impairment while clodronate (12 of 1000; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39) and denosumab (11 of 1000; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.19) probably results in little to no difference regarding the occurrence of renal impairment compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty).Authors' conclusionsWhen considering bone‐modifying agents for managing bone loss in women with early or locally advanced breast cancer, one has to balance between efficacy and safety. Our findings suggest that bisphosphonates (excluding alendronate and pamidronate) or denosumab compared to no treatment or placebo likely results in increased bone mineral density and reduced fracture rates. Our survival analysis that included pre and postmenopausal women showed little to no difference regarding overall survival. These treatments may lead to more adverse events. Therefore, forming an overall judgement of the best ranked bone‐modifying agent is challenging. More head‐to‐head comparisons, especially comparing denosumab with any bisphosphonate, are needed to address gaps and validate the findings of this review.",1
"N6 methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), has been extensively studied in recent years. Dysregulation of m6A and its associated machinery (including “writers”, “erasers” and “readers”) has been frequently observed in various cancer types, and their dysregulation profiles may serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers. The dysregulated m6A modifiers have been shown to function as oncogenes or tumour suppressors, and play essential roles in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, metabolism, drug resistance, and immune evasion, as well as in cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumour microenvironment, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the dysregulated m6A machinery for cancer treatment. In this review, we illustrate the mechanisms by which m6A modifiers interplay and orchestrate the fate of target RNAs. We also describe the state-of-the-art methodologies for mapping global m6A in cancer epitranscriptomes. We further summarize the recent discoveries regarding the dysregulations of m6A and the associated machinery in cancers and their pathological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms in cancers. Finally, we discuss the findings on m6A related molecules as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers, as well as the recent development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting oncogenic m6A modifiers and their preclinical results in treating cancers.","The medical sciences have mirrored the rapid growth of nanotechnology in recent years. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are a good example. Owing to its unique features, for example, superparamagnetism, higher surface area, surface-to-volume fraction, facile uncoupling methods, and IONPs have recently received a great deal of focus. Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) with appropriate Surface chemistry have been created utilizing a range of physical and chemical methods. The IONPs employed in bioscience, health aid, environmental rehabilitation, and other domains were examined. The surface stabilization of IONPs with different stabilizers is explained in this review. This review discusses the necessary characterization of IONPs using multiple qualitative and quantitative methodologies in biological activity, which is beneficial owing to biodegradability and biocompatibility, simplicity of production, and magnetic behavior. This review covers practically all methods of IONP synthesis, size, and morphology, as well as their latest applications in many domains. With the present significance of Fe NPs, the current review aims to provide best of the information on the production, characterization, and uses of these NPs.",0
"BackgroundT cells have been proven to play important roles in anti-tumor and tumor microenvironment shaping, while these roles have not been explained in bladder cancer (BLCA).MethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to screen T-cell marker genes. Bulk RNA-sequencing data and clinical information from BLCA patients were downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database to develop a prognosis signature. We analyzed the association of different risk groups with survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and immunotherapy response.ResultsBased on 192 T-cell marker genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis, we constructed a prognostic signature containing 7 genes in the training cohort, which was further validated in the testing cohort and GEO cohort. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 1-, 3-, and 5 years were 0.734, 0.742 and 0.726 in the training cohort, 0.697, 0.671 and 0.670 in the testing cohort, 0.702, 0.665 and 0.629 in the GEO cohort, respectively. In addition, we constructed a nomogram based on clinical factors and the risk score of the signature. The low-risk group exhibited higher immune-related pathways, immune cell infiltration and TMB levels. Importantly, immunophenotype score and immunotherapy cohort (IMvigor210) analyses showed that the low-risk group had better immunotherapy response and prognosis.ConclusionsOur study reveals a novel prognostic signature based on T-cell marker genes, which provides a new target and theoretical support for BLCA patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04881-1.","PurposeLaryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs) are aggressive tumors with the second-highest morbidity rate in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Cuproptosis is a type of programmed cell death that impacts tumor malignancy and progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between cuproptosis-related long non-coding RNAs (crlncRNAs) and the tumor immune microenvironment and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in LSCC, and crlncRNA impact on LSCC malignancy.Materials and methodsClinical and RNA-sequencing data from patients with LSCC were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Differentially expressed prognosis-related crlncRNAs were identified based on univariate Cox regression analysis, a crlncRNA signature for LSCC was developed and validated using LASSO Cox regression. Finally, the effect of LINC02454, the core signature crlncRNA, on LSCC malignancy progression was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe identified a four-crlncRNA signature (LINC02454, AC026310.1, AC090517.2, and AC000123.1), according to which we divided the patients into high- and low-risk groups. The crlncRNA signature risk score was an independent prognostic indicator for overall and progression-free survival, and displayed high predictive accuracy. Patients with a higher abundance of infiltrating dendritic cells, M0 macrophages, and neutrophils had worse prognoses and those in the high-risk group were highly sensitive to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Knockdown of LINC02454 caused tumor suppression, via cuproptosis induction.ConclusionsA novel signature of four crlncRNAs was found to be highly accurate as a risk prediction model for patients with LSCC and to have potential for improving the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of LSCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05281-1.",1
"Pre-treatment role of FDG PET CT scan to evaluate- the extent of the primary lesion, nodal staging and distant metastasis in oral carcinoma in various TNM stages. Additionally, our study investigated the Correlation between SUVmax values on FDG-PET CT scans and histopathological proven positive nodes in patients undergoing surgery. In this study, all suspected cases of oral carcinoma in adults who visited the ENT clinic were examined and evaluated using various methods, including clinical examination, cytology, histopathology, and imaging tests like CECT scans, ultrasound, and CEMRI. Based on the results of these evaluations, the patients were staged. The patients were then given FDG-PET CT scans (done within 2 weeks of CECT/MRI scans), for restaging and treatment plans, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of these methods, were developed. After surgery, the patients were restaged based on the histopathology report, and the results of the FDG-PET CT scans were compared to the histopathological findings and the histopathological positive nodes were compared to the SUV max value on the FDG PET CT scan and were correlated. In our study, the mean age of patients was found to be 50 years with a male: female ratio of 3.5:1. Maximum tumors presented at the buccal mucosa region. 92% of patients gave a history of tobacco addiction, and 18% were smokers. As per initial biopsy reports, maximum (62%) tumors were detected to be WDSCC, 2% were MDSCC and 6% were PDSCC. All 50 patients had normal findings on the chest x-ray and USG abdomen. 41 patients underwent CECT scans and 9 patients got CEMRI scans done. Staging after FDG PET CT scan was compared with that of radiological staging. It was found that in T staging there was upstaging in 36% of cases and downstaging in 14% of cases following the FDG PET CT scan. Likewise, N staging showed upstaging in 36% of cases and downstaging in 16% of cases after the FDG PET CT scan. In M staging, there was upstaging in 10% of cases after the FDG PET CT scan. In our study 15 cases got operated on. All 8 (53.3%) cases of postoperative histopathological positive lymph nodes had SUV max values greater than their reference value (> 2.5), and all negative histopathological lymph nodes had a low SUV max (< 2.5) value in the PET CT scan. The FDG PET CT scan is a highly effective tool for accurately diagnosing, staging, and predicting the outcome of oral cancers at all stages of the disease. The SUV max value (> 2.5) of the PET CT scan is positively correlated with the likelihood of nodal metastasis, as higher values were found to correspond with histopathological evidence of positive neck nodes.","Oral cancer is notoriously painful. Activation of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2, encoded by F2RL1) by proteases in the cancer microenvironment is implicated in oral cancer pain. PAR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed on neurons and cells in the cancer microenvironment. Sustained signaling of PAR2 from endosomes of neurons mediates sensitization and nociception. We focused on the differential contribution of PAR2 on oral cancer cells and neurons to oral cancer pain and whether encapsulation of a PAR2 inhibitor, AZ3451 in nanoparticles (NP) more effectively reverses PAR2 activation. We report that F2RL1 was overexpressed in human oral cancers and cancer cell lines. Deletion of F2RL1 on cancer cells reduced cancer-associated mechanical allodynia. A third-generation polyamidoamine dendrimer, functionalized with cholesterol was self-assembled into NPs encapsulating AZ3451. NP encapsulated AZ3451 (PAMAM-Chol-AZ NPs) more effectively reversed activation of PAR2 at the plasma membrane and early endosomes than free drug. The PAMAM-Chol-AZ NPs showed greater efficacy in reversing nociception than free drug, with respect to both level and duration, in three preclinical mouse models of oral cancer pain. The antinociceptive efficacy was confirmed with an operant orofacial assay. Genetic deletion of F2RL1 on cancer cells or F2rl1 on neurons each partially reversed mechanical cancer allodynia. The remaining nociception could be effectively reversed by PAMAM-Chol-AZ NPs. These findings suggest that PAR2 on oral cancer cells and neurons contribute to oral cancer nociception and NPs loaded with a PAR2 antagonist provide increased antinociception and improved oral function compared to free drug.",1
"PurposeThis study was conducted to investigate impacts of potential anticancer (associated with apoptosis and caspase pathways) of two newly synthesized derivatives of pillararene, named as d-Q-P5 and p-Q-P5, on Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) cells.Materials and methodsThe MTT method was used to determine the IC50 doses of the derivatives on HNSCC cells, and the changes in gene expression were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The apoptosis change was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis.ResultsThe results showed that the d-Q-P5 and p-Q-P5 effectively inhibited the proliferation of the cells by upregulating proapoptotic genes (Bax, Bad, p53, Bak, and Apaf-1) and genes involved in the caspase pathway (Casp2, Casp3, and Casp9), while downregulating the antiapoptotic gene (Bcl-2).ConclusionsThis study is the first to demonstrate the potential anticancer effects of these two agents on HNSCC cells by positively regulating apoptosis gene expression.","BackgroundIn this study, we used immune repertoire (IR) sequencing technology to profile the diversity of peripheral blood T cell receptors and used transcriptomics to profile the gene expression of peripheral blood neutrophil mRNA in patients with mild-moderate knee osteoarthritis (KOA) before and after electroacupuncture (EA) treatment.MethodsAn 8-week intervention with EA was performed on 3 subjects with KOA. IR sequencing of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) was performed using RNA extracted from peripheral blood T cells of KOA subjects prior to and at the end of the intervention, as well as healthy volunteers (controls) who matched the subjects in sex and age. Neutrophils were extracted from the plasma of healthy individuals, pretreatment patients, and posttreatment patients for further transcriptome sequencing.ResultsThe D50, diversity index (DI), and Shannon entropy values of circulatory T-cells were significantly lower in pretreatment KOA patients compared to healthy controls. Posttreatment KOA samples displayed significant decreases in serum proinflammatory factors, IL-8 and IL-18 (P < 0.01), as well as a substantial reduction in serum matrix MMP-3 and MMP-13 (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of CXCL2, IRF8, and PEAR1 (P < 0.05) was significantly higher in patients before the treatment than in the healthy population and was significantly down-regulated after the treatment. In contrast, the expression of SMPD3 (P < 0.05) showed the opposite trend.ConclusionEA may alleviate KOA by rebalancing T-cell homeostasis and improving systemic inflammation. At the same time, EA treatment can significantly enhance TCR diversity, reduce levels of proinflammatory factors, and increase levels of anti-inflammatory factors, thereby achieving therapeutic effects.Clinical Trial registrationNCT 03366363.",0
"Inflammation and a dysregulated immune system are common denominators in cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) highlighted the convergence of interleukin (IL)-1β biology in cancer and CVD, and the potential of anti–IL-1β drugs for the treatment of both disease entities. Accumulating evidence further supports the role of the innate immunity members and IL-1β activators, S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in both cancer and CVD. This review outlines the common involvement of S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in cancer and CVD. Specifically, their time-, cell-, and context-dependent actions and hereto-related dichotomous role in different cancers and CVD are addressed, highlighting the need for further insights to allow tailored therapies.","PurposeFor patients with advanced HCC, predictors of immunotherapy response are scarce, and the benefits of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment after immunotherapy are unclear. We explored whether clinical features, such as target lesion response, immune-mediated toxicity, or subsequent TKI therapy predict immunotherapy response.MethodsWe retrospectively studied 77 patients with advanced HCC receiving immunotherapy. Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed using various statistical methods, including the log-rank test and Kaplan–Meier methods. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used for multivariable survival analysis.ResultsFor all patients, median overall survival (mOS) was 13 months (95% CI 8–19), and median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 6 months (95% CI 4–10). Patients with partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) compared to progressive disease (PD) had prolonged mPFS (27 vs. 5 vs. 1 month(s), p < 0.0001) and mOS (not met vs. 11 vs. 3 months, p < 0.0001). Patients with vs. without immune-mediated toxicities trended towards longer mPFS (9 vs. 4 months p = 0.133) and mOS (17 vs. 9 months; p = 0.095). Patients who did vs. did not receive a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) after immunotherapy had a significantly improved mOS (19 vs. 5 months, p = 0.0024)). Based on multivariate modeling, the hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) of patients receiving TKI vs. no TKI was 0.412 (p = 0.0043).ConclusionWe show that disease control predicts prolonged mOS and mPFS. Furthermore, TKI therapy administered after immunotherapy predicts prolonged mOS in patients with advanced HCC.",0
"ABSTRACTImmune checkpoint inhibitors, especially those targeting CD274/PD-L1yield powerful clinical therapeutic efficacy. Thoughmuch progress has been made in the development of antibody-basedCD274 drugs, chemical compounds applied for CD274degradation remain largely unavailable. Herein,baicalein, a monomer of traditional Chinese medicine, isscreened and validated to target CD274 and induces itsmacroautophagic/autophagic degradation. Moreover, we demonstrate thatCD274 directly interacts with MAP1LC3B (microtubule associatedprotein 1 light chain 3 beta). Intriguingly, baicalein potentiatesCD274-LC3 interaction to facilitate autophagic-lysosomal degradationof CD274. Importantly, targeted CD274. degradation via baicaleininhibits tumor development by boosting T-cell-mediated antitumorimmunity. Thus, we elucidate a critical role of autophagy-lysosomalpathway in mediating CD274 degradation, and conceptually demonstratethat the design of a molecular “glue” that tethers the CD274-LC3interaction is an appealing strategy to develop CD274 inhibitors incancer therapy.Abbreviations: ATTECs: autophagy-tethering compounds; AUTACs: AUtophagy-TArgeting Chimeras; AUTOTACs: AUTOphagy-TArgeting Chimeras; AMPK: adenosine 5‘-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase; BiFC: bimolecular fluorescence complementation; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; CD274/PD-L1/B7-H1: CD274 molecule; CQ: chloroquine; CGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; DAPI: 4’6-diamino-2-phenylindole; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GZMB: granzyme B; IHC: immunohistochemistry; ICB: immune checkpoint blockade; KO: knockout; KD: equilibrium dissociation constant; LYTAC: LYsosome-TArgeting Chimera; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MST: microscale thermophoresis; NFAT: nuclear factor of activated T cells; NFKB/NF-kB: nuclear factor kappa B; NSCLC: non-small-cell lung cancer; PDCD1: programmed cell death 1; PROTACs: PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras; PRF1: perforin 1; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; PHA: phytohemagglutinin; PMA: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; SPR: surface plasmon resonance; TILs: tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte; TME: tumor microenvironment.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent form of gastrointestinal malignancy with challenges in chemotherapy resistance and side effects. Effective and low toxic drugs for CRC treatment are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death, which has garnered attention for its therapeutic potential against cancer. Baicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is the primary flavone extracted from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis that exhibits anticancer effects against several malignancies including CRC. In this study, we investigated whether baicalein induced ferroptosis in CRC cells. We showed that baicalein (1–64 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of human CRC lines HCT116 and DLD1. Co-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (1 μM) significantly mitigated baicalein-induced CRC cell death, whereas autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (25 μM), necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (10 μM), or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (10 μM) did not rescue baicalein-induced CRC cell death. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the inhibitory effect of baicalein on CRC cells is associated with ferroptosis induction. We revealed that baicalein (7.5–30 μM) dose-dependently decreased the expression levels of GPX4, key regulator of ferroptosis, in HCT116 and DLD1 cells by blocking janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway via direct interaction with JAK2, ultimately leading to ferroptosis in CRC cells. In a CRC xenograft mouse model, administration of baicalein (10, 20 mg/kg, i.g., every two days for two weeks) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth with significant ferroptosis induced by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 axis in tumor tissue. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis contributes to baicalein-induced anti-CRC activity through blockade of the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 signaling pathway, which provides evidence for the therapeutic application of baicalein against CRC.",1
"Despite significant advancement in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of breast carcinoma, the prognosis remains dismal. Recently, with advances in its understanding, various immune system-based management strategies have been developed. CTLA-4 suppresses lymphocyte reactivity, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2 receptor expression and triggers cell cycle arrest. PD-L1 inhibits the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibits release of cytokines. Hence, we planned to evaluate the immunoexpression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in invasive ductal carcinoma breast and seek correlation between their immunopositivity and the clinicopathological parameters. This was a retrospective study conducted on archival material of 50 cases of breast carcinoma tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological details were recorded. All cases were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Cytoplasmic expression of CTLA-4 and membranous expression of PD-L1 were considered positive and staining intensity was recorded as mild, moderate, and intense. Data was recorded and analyzed. Immunopositivity for CTLA-4 was seen in 92% of cases of breast carcinoma. CTLA-4 staining intensity showed significant association with TNM staging of breast carcinomas (p = 0.036). Age group of the breast carcinoma cases showed a statistically significant correlation with PD-L1 immunoexpression (p = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between all other clinicopathological characteristics and CTLA-4 or PD-L1 immunostaining. Our study shows that CTLA-4 is a more important immune checkpoint regulator in breast carcinomas in comparison to PD-L1. Thus, anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy might prove to be of immense help in the treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma breast showing overexpression of CTLA-4.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor with significant global health implications. The role of CD4+ T cells, particularly conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), in HCC progression remains unexplored. Furthermore, epigenetic factors are crucial in immune regulation, yet their specific role in HCC-infiltrating Tconv cells remains elusive. This study elucidates the role of MATR3, an epigenetic regulator, in modulating Tconv activity and immune evasion within the HCC microenvironment. Reanalysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed that early activation of CD4+ T cells is crucial for establishing an antitumor immune response. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that Tconv enhances cDC1-induced CD8+ T-cell activation. Screening identified MATR3 as a critical regulator of Tconv function, which is necessary for antitumour activity but harmful when overexpressed. Excessive MATR3 expression exacerbates Tconv exhaustion and impairs function by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to relax chromatin in the TOX promoter region, leading to aberrant transcriptional changes. In summary, MATR3 is an HCC-specific epigenetic checkpoint that bidirectionally regulates Tconv antitumour immunity, suggesting new therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic regulators to enhance antitumour immunity in HCC.",1
"With more treatment options in oncology lead to better outcomes and more favorable side effect profiles, patients are living longer — with higher quality of life — than ever, with a growing survivor population. As the needs of patients and providers evolve, and technology advances, cancer care is subject to change. This review explores the myriad of changes in the current oncology landscape with a focus on the patient perspective and patient-centered care.","PurposeDissociated response (DR, reduction at baseline or increase < 20% in target lesions compared with nadir in the presence of new lesions) was observed in 20–34% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). DRs were defined as progression disease (PD) per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1), while evaluation criteria related to immunotherapy incorporated the new lesions into the total tumor burden or conducted further evaluation after 4–8 weeks rather than declaring PD immediately. The main objective of this study is to compare survival between people who continuing initial ICIs treatment and those who switched to other anticancer therapy at the time of DR.Patients and methods235 patients with advanced lung cancer (LC) treated with ICIs were evaluated. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize potential confounding factors. Post-DR OS, target lesion changes were evaluated.Results52 patients had been estimated as DRs. After PSM, the continuing ICIs treatment Post-DR cohort still had a significantly longer median post-DR OS than discontinuing ICIs treatment Post-DR cohort, 10.63 months (95% CI 6.27–NA) versus 4.33 months (95% CI 1.77–NA), respectively (p = 0.016).ConclusionWithin the limitations of this single-center retrospective analysis, clinically stable patients who were judged by clinicians to be eligible for continuing ICIs treatment post-DR derived apparent OS benefit than discontinuing counterpart.",0
"IntroductionThe aim of this study was to investigate the role of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis and to develop a nomogram for predicting HCC prognosis.Method In this study, 1066 HCC patients were enrolled between August 2018 and April 2022. TK1 levels were measured within one week before enrollment, and the relationship with HCC prognosis was evaluated. Next, all patients were randomly assigned to the training set (70%, n = 746) and the validation set (30%, n = 320). We used multivariate Cox analysis to find independent prognostic factors in the training set to construct a nomogram. The predictive power of the nomogram was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The optimal critical value of TK1 was determined as 2.35 U/L using X-tile software.ResultBefore and after propensity score matching (PSM), the median overall survival (mOS) of the low-TK1 group (< 2.35 U/L) remained significantly longer than that of the high-TK1 group (≥ 2.35 U/L) (48.1 vs 16.5 months, p < 0.001; 75.7 vs 19.8 months, p = 0.001). Moreover, multivariate Cox analysis showed that the low TK1 level was an independent positive prognostic indicator. Additionally, the area under the ROC curve for predicting the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates was 0.770, 0.758, and 0.805, respectively.ConclusionsTK1 could serve as a prognostic marker for HCC. In addition, the nomogram showed good predictive capability for HCC prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05089-z.","Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer that reflects the increased energetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferating cancer cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that many aspects of tumor metabolism in vivo differ from those of cancer cells in culture, and that the tumor microenvironment plays a major role in driving these differences. Apart from cancer cells, tumors are composed of diverse cell types including vascular cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Nutrient sharing and competition between different cell types and access to nutrients in tumor tissue are not well modeled in standard monoculture systems. Tumors can also interact with whole body metabolism and share nutrients with peripheral tissues such as fat and muscle. Hence, studying some aspects of cancer metabolism in mouse models is useful for examining the complex metabolic interactions between cells and tissues. In this article, we discuss how advances in mouse modeling have enabled studies of tumor metabolism in vivo, providing insight into metabolic factors that influence cancer cell behavior in the physiological context of a whole organism. These studies are providing insight into how to leverage altered cancer metabolism for improved therapy.",0
"AbstractMost patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have limited treatment options following standard-of-care therapy. VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05425940 (ClinicalTrials.gov)","ABSTRACTLoss of ovarian homeostasis is associated with ovary dysfunction and female diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the establishment of homeostasis and its function in the ovary have not been fully elucidated. Here, we showed that conditional knockout of Rab37 in oocytes impaired macroautophagy/autophagy proficiency in the ovary and interfered with follicular homeostasis and ovary development in mice. Flunarizine treatment upregulated autophagy, thus rescuing the impairment of follicular homeostasis and ovarian dysfunction in rab37 knockout mice by reprogramming of homeostasis. Notably, both the E2F1 and EGR2 transcription factors synergistically activated Rab37 transcription and promoted autophagy.

"PurposeCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a devastating complication with limited recognized clinical risk factors. We examined characteristics among solid and liquid cancers utilizing Machine learning (ML) approaches for predicting CRF.MethodsWe utilized 2017 National Inpatient Sample database and employed generalized linear models to assess the association between CRF and the outcome of burden of illness among hospitalized solid and non-solid tumors patients. And further applied lasso, ridge and Random Forest (RF) for building our linear and non-linear ML models.ResultsThe 2017 database included 196,330 prostate (PCa), 66,385 leukemia (Leuk), 107,245 multiple myeloma (MM), and 41,185 cancers of lip, oral cavity and pharynx (CLOP) patients, and among them, there were 225, 140, 125 and 115 CRF patients, respectively. CRF was associated with a higher burden of illness among Leuk and MM, and higher mortality among PCa. For the PCa patients, both the test and the training data had best areas under the ROC curve [AUC = 0.91 (test) vs. 0.90 (train)] for both lasso and ridge ML. For the CLOP, this was 0.86 and 0.79 for ridge; 0.87 and 0.84 for lasso; 0.82 for both test and train for RF and for the Leuk cohort, 0.81 (test) and 0.76 (train) for both ridge and lasso.ConclusionThis study provided an effective platform to assess potential risks and outcomes of CRF in patients hospitalized for the management of solid and non-solid tumors. Our study showed ML methods performed well in predicting the CRF among solid and liquid tumors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05197-w.","PurposeThe current evaluation methods for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly CD8 + TILs, mainly rely on semiquantitative immunohistochemistry with high variability. We aimed to construct an individualized DNA methylation-based signature for CD8 + TILs (CD8 + MeTIL) that may characterize melanoma immune microenvironment and guide therapeutic selection.MethodsThe transcriptome profiles and DNA methylation data of 457 melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed. Differential methylation analysis between groups with high and low CD8 + TILs was performed to select differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and define CD8 + MeTIL. The prognostic value of CD8 + MeTIL and its predictive value for immunotherapy response were investigated using multiple melanoma cohorts.ResultsWe successfully constructed the CD8 + MeTIL signature based on four DMPs. The survival analyses showed that higher CD8 + MeTIL score was associated with worse survival outcomes in TCGA-SKCM and GSE144487 cohorts. The ROC curve for the predictive analysis revealed that the survival prediction of CD8 + MeTIL score was superior compared with CD8 + TILs (CIBERSORT) and CD8B mRNA expression. Furthermore, we founded that tumors with higher CD8 + MeTIL score were marked with immunosuppressive characteristics, including low immune score and downregulated immune-related pathways. More importantly, the CD8 + MeTIL score showed a potential predictive value for the benefit from immunotherapy in two published cohorts. When combined CD8 + MeTIL with PD-L1 expression, the patient classification showed significantly different immunotherapy response rates and long-term survival outcomes.ConclusionsThe CD8 + MeTIL signature might be as a novel method to evaluate CD8 + TILs and guide immunotherapy approaches.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04566-1.",1
"Background and aimFKBP1A, a gene encoding the FK506-binding protein 1A, has emerged as a significant player in cancer progression and prognosis. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer, focusing on its differential expression patterns, prognostic implications, genetic alterations, and associations with the tumor microenvironment.Methods and resultsUsing large-scale datasets, including GTEx, TCGA, HPA, and cBioPortal, we analyzed FKBP1A expression across normal tissues and various cancer types. Our findings revealed that FKBP1A exhibited aberrant upregulation in most human cancers, making it a potential biomarker for malignancy. Moreover, FKBP1A expression correlated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, disease-free interval, and progression-free interval in several cancers, indicating its prognostic significance. Genetic alteration analysis showed that FKBP1A gene amplification was prevalent, particularly in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, FKBP1A expression was associated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, highlighting its potential involvement in tumor-immune response. Notably, FKBP1A expression positively correlated with stromal and immune cell scores, suggesting its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, according to the functional enrichment analysis, experimental validation in lung adenocarcinoma confirmed the role of FKBP1A through the regulation of EGFR signaling by apoptosis, which is consistent with drug sensitivity analysis to some extent.ConclusionIn conclusion, FKBP1A exhibits differential expression in cancer, serves as a prognostic indicator, undergoes genetic alterations, and influences the tumor-immune microenvironment. These findings shed light on the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer development and progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and guidance of clinical drugs selection, and provide valuable insights into patient prognosis for interventions based on pharmaceuticals.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05362-1.","Cancer incidence and mortality rates can vary widely among diferent racial and ethnic groups, attributed to a complex interplay of genetic, environmental and social factors.

"AbstractBackgroundAcquired resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy due to DNA mismatch repair (MMR) enzyme deficiency is a barrier to improving outcomes for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) patients. KL-50 is a new imidazotetrazine-based therapeutic designed to induce DNA interstrand cross-links, and subsequent double-stranded breaks, in an MMR-independent manner in cells with O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) deficiency. Previous research showed its efficacy against LN229 glioma cells with MMR and MGMT knockdown. Its activity against patient-derived GBM that model post-TMZ recurrent tumors is unclear.MethodsWe created MMR-deficient GBM patient-derived xenografts through exposure to TMZ, followed by treatment with additional TMZ or KL-50. We also generated isogenic, MSH6 knockout (KO) patient-derived GBM and tested them for sensitivity to TMZ and KL-50.ResultsKL-50 extended the median survival of mice intracranially engrafted with either patient-derived TMZ-naïve GBM6 or TMZ-naïve GBM12 by 1.75-fold and 2.15-fold, respectively (P < 0.0001). A low dose (4 Gy) of fractionated RT further extended the survival of KL-50-treated GBM12 mice (median survival = 80 days for RT + KL-50 vs. 71 days KL-50 alone, P = 0.018). KL-50 also extended the median survival of mice engrafted with post-TMZ, MMR-deficient GBM6R-m185 (140 days for KL-50 vs. 37 days for vehicle, P < 0.0001). MSH6 KO increased TMZ IC50 for GBM6 and GBM12 cultures by >5-fold and >12-fold for cell death and live cell count outputs, respectively. In contrast, MSH6-KO actually decreased KL-50 IC50 by 10–80%.ConclusionKL-50-based compounds are a promising new strategy for the treatment of MGMT-deficient, MMR-deficient GBM that recurs after frontline TMZ.","AbstractBackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies targeting glioblastoma (GBM)-associated antigens such as interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL-13Rα2) have achieved limited clinical efficacy to date, in part due to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by inhibitory molecules such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). The aim of this study was to engineer more potent GBM-targeting CAR-T cells by countering TGF-β-mediated immune suppression in the TME.MethodsWe engineered a single-chain, bispecific CAR targeting IL-13Rα2 and TGF-β, which programs tumor-specific T cells to convert TGF-β from an immunosuppressant to an immunostimulant. Bispecific IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells were evaluated for efficacy and safety against both patient-derived GBM xenografts and syngeneic models of murine glioma.ResultsTreatment with IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells leads to greater T-cell infiltration and reduced suppressive myeloid cell presence in the tumor-bearing brain compared to treatment with conventional IL-13Rα2 CAR-T cells, resulting in improved survival in both patient-derived GBM xenografts and syngeneic models of murine glioma.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that by reprogramming tumor-specific T-cell responses to TGF-β, bispecific IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells resist and remodel the immunosuppressive TME to drive potent anti-tumor responses in GBM.",1
"Chronic systemic inflammation significantly increases myocardial infarction risk in people living with HIV (PLWH). Endothelial cell dysfunction disrupts vascular homeostasis regulation, increasing the risk of vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis, contributing to cardiovascular disease. We aimed to characterize endothelial cell (EC) chemokines, cytokine and chemokine receptors of PLWH, hypothesizing that in our cohort, glucose intolerance contributes to their differential expression implicated in endothelial dysfunction. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we phenotyped chemokine, chemokine, and cytokine receptor expression on arterial ECs, capillary ECs, venous ECs, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 59 PLWH with and without glucose intolerance. Our results show that arterial and capillary ECs express significantly higher interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors than venous ECs and VSMCs. Venous ECs exhibited more interleukin (IL)1R1 and ACKR1 receptors, and VSMCs showed significant IL6R expression than arterial and capillary ECs. When stratified by group, arterial ECs from PLWH with glucose intolerance expressed significantly higher IL1R1, IL6R, CXCL12, CCL14, and ICAM2 transcripts than arterial ECs from PLWH without diabetes. Of the different vascular cell types studied, arterial ECs as a proportion of all ECs in adipose tissue were positively correlated with plasma fasting blood glucose. In contrast, venous ECs and VSMCs were positively correlated with plasma IL6. To directly assess the effect of plasma from PLWH on endothelial function, we cultured human arterial ECs (HAECs) in plasma-conditioned media from PLWH and performed bulk RNA sequencing. Plasma from PLWH stimulated ECs with the upregulation of genes that enrich for the oxidative phosphorylation and the TNF-α via NFK-β pathways. In conclusion, ECs in PLWH show heterogeneous cytokine and chemokine receptor expression, and arterial ECs were the most influenced by glucose intolerance. Further research must explicate cytokine and chemokine roles in EC dysfunction and identify biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response.","This study investigated the role of swimming exercise in regulating melanoma tumour growth and glycolysis in cancer cells, the specific mechanism involved was also studied. In our study, a murine melanoma tumour model was established to assess the impact of swimming on tumour growth. The mRNA and protein expressions were assessed using qRT-PCR, western blot, and IHC. The metabolic behavior of melanoma cells was examined through lactic acid level measurements and glucose consumption assessments. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to detect cell viability and proliferation. ELISA was employed to determine the levels of cytokines secreted by macrophages. The interaction between APOL3 and STAT3 was analyzed by dual luciferase reporter gene and ChIP assays. Our results demonstrated that swimming exercise suppressed melanoma growth in mice by suppressing glycolysis, which might be related to APOL3 upregulation. In addition, downregulation of APOL3 in melanoma was associated with poor prognosis, and APOL3 overexpression markedly suppressed melanoma cell proliferation by reducing glucose uptake and lactate production in vitro. Mechanistically, STAT3 directly down-regulated APOL3 transcription. Swimming upregulated APOL3 by inactivating the IL-6R-STAT3 signaling axis in melanoma cells by inhibiting the secretion of IL-6 by M2 macrophages. As expected, IL-6 secreted by M2 macrophages promoted glycolysis in melanoma cells by reducing APOL3 expression. In summary, swimming inactivated the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling axis in melanoma cells by inhibiting the secretion of IL-6 by M2 macrophages, which could suppress the growth of melanoma in the body by upregulating APOL3 to inhibit glycolysis.",1
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious, progressive, and irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid β-protein (Aβ) to form senile plaques and abnormal phosphorylation of intracellular tau protein to form neuronal fiber tangles. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and there are several hypotheses, primarily including the Aβ cascade hypothesis, the neurofibrillary tangle hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, and the cholinergic hypothesis. It has been suggested that the dysregulation of multiple energy metabolic pathways, especially mitochondria metabolism, may be related to the severity of AD pathology and disease symptoms in the brain. The modification of histone (lysine) methylation, an actively regulated and reversible process, is closely related to energy metabolism and plays a crucial role in AD development. In summary, histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD restricted and regulated each other. Here, we review the advances in the correlation between histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD. This can provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and its control.","AbstractBackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies targeting glioblastoma (GBM)-associated antigens such as interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL-13Rα2) have achieved limited clinical efficacy to date, in part due to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by inhibitory molecules such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β).

"PurposeEarly biochemical recurrence (eBCR) indicated a high risk for potential recurrence and metastasis in prostate cancer. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification played an important role in prostate cancer progression. This study aimed to develop a m6A lncRNA signature to accurately predict eBCR in prostate cancer.MethodsPearson correlation analysis was first conducted to explore m6A lncRNAs and univariate Cox regression analysis was further performed to identify m6A lncRNAs of prognostic roles for predicting eBCR in prostate cancer. The m6A lncRNA signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis (LASSO) in training cohort and further validated in test cohort. Furthermore, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were utilized to explore potential effective drugs for high-risk group in this study.ResultsFive hundred and thirty-eighth m6A lncRNAs were searched out through Pearson correlation analysis and 25 out of 538 m6A lncRNAs were identified to pose prediction roles for eBCR in prostate cancers. An m6A lncRNA signature including 5 lncRNAs was successfully built in training cohort. The high-risk group derived from m6A lncRNA signature could efficiently predict eBCR occurrence in both training (p < 0.001) and test cohort (p = 0.002). ROC analysis also confirmed that lncRNA signature in this study posed more accurate prediction roles for eBCR occurrence when compared with PSA, TNM stages and Gleason scores. Drug sensitivity analysis further discovered that various drugs could be potentially utilized to treat high-risk samples in this study. ConclusionsThe m6A lncRNA signature in this study could be utilized to efficiently predict eBCR occurrence, various clinical characteristic and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04040-y.","BackgroundCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an essential component of the tumor immune microenvironment that are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We aim to investigate the characteristics of CAFs in prostate cancer and develop a biochemical recurrence (BCR)-related CAF signature for predicting the prognosis of PCa patients.MethodsThe bulk RNA-seq and relevant clinical information were obtained from the TCGA and GEO databases, respectively. The infiltration scores of CAFs in prostate cancer patients were calculated using the MCP counter and EPIC algorithms. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was downloaded from the GEO database. Subsequently, univariate Cox regression analysis was employed to identify prognostic genes associated with CAFs. We identified two subtypes (C1 and C2) of prostate cancer that were associated with CAFs via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. In addition, the BCR-related CAF signatures were constructed using Lasso regression analysis. Finally, a nomogram model was established based on the risk score and clinical characteristics of the patients.ResultsInitially, we found that patients with high CAF infiltration scores had shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) times. Subsequently, CAFs in four pairs of tumors and paracancerous tissues were identified. We discovered 253 significantly differentially expressed genes, of which 13 had prognostic significance. Using NMF clustering, we divided PCa patients into C1 and C2 subgroups, with the C1 subgroup having a worse prognosis and substantially enriched cell cycle, homologous recombination, and mismatch repair pathways. Furthermore, a BCR-related CAFs signature was established. Multivariate COX regression analysis confirmed that the BCR-related CAFs signature was an independent prognostic factor for BCR in PCa. In addition, the nomogram was based on the clinical characteristics and risk scores of the patient and demonstrated high accuracy and reliability for predicting BCR. Lastly, our findings indicate that the risk score may be a useful tool for predicting PCa patients’ sensitivity to immunotherapy and drug treatment.ConclusionNMF clustering based on CAF-related genes revealed distinct TME immune characteristics between groups. The BCR-related CAF signature accurately predicted prognosis and immunotherapy response in prostate cancer patients, offering a promising new approach to cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05011-7.",1
"Aging is associated with immunological changes that compromise response to infections and vaccines, exacerbate inflammatory diseases and can potentially mitigate tissue repair. Even so, age-related changes to the immune response to tissue damage and regenerative medicine therapies remain unknown. Here, it is characterized how aging induces changes in immunological signatures that inhibit tissue repair and therapeutic response to a clinical regenerative biological scaffold derived from extracellular matrix. Signatures of inflammation and interleukin (IL)-17 signaling increased with injury and treatment both locally and regionally in aged animals, and computational analysis uncovered age-associated senescent-T cell communication that promotes type 3 immunity in T cells. Local inhibition of type 3 immune activation using IL17-neutralizing antibodies improves healing and restores therapeutic response to the regenerative biomaterial, promoting muscle repair in older animals. These results provide insights into tissue immune dysregulation that occurs with aging that can be targeted to rejuvenate repair.","Immune-based therapeutic interventions recognizing proteins localized on the cell surface of cancer cells are emerging as a promising cancer treatment. Antibody-based therapies and engineered T cells are now approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat some malignancies. These therapies utilize a few cell surface proteins highly expressed on cancer cells to release the negative regulation of immune activation that limits antitumor responses (for example, PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4) or to redirect the T cell specificity toward blood cancer cells (for example, CD19 and B cell maturation antigen). One limitation preventing broader application of these novel therapeutic strategies to all cancer types is the lack of suitable target antigens for all indications owing in part to the challenges in identifying such targets. Ideal target antigens are cell surface proteins highly expressed on malignant cells and absent in healthy tissues. Technological advances in mass spectrometry, enrichment protocols, and computational tools for cell surface protein isolation and annotation have recently enabled comprehensive analyses of the cancer cell surface proteome, from which novel immunotherapeutic target antigens may emerge. Here, we review the most recent progress in this field.",0
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Although early-stage treatments exhibit promising 5-year survival rates, the treatment options for advanced stage disease are constrained, with short survival benefits due to the challenges associated with effective and selective drug delivery to PCa cells. Even though targeting Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) has been extensively explored and is clinically employed for imaging and radio-ligand therapy, the clinical success of PSMA-based approaches for targeted delivery of chemotherapies remains elusive. In this study, we combine a generation 4 hydroxy polyamidoamine dendrimer (PD) with irreversible PSMA ligand (CTT1298) to develop a PSMA-targeted nanoplatform (PD-CTT1298) for selective intracellular delivery of potent chemotherapeutics to PCa. PD-CTT1298-Cy5 exhibits a PSMA IC50 in the nanomolar range and demonstrates selective uptake in PSMA (+) PCa cells via PSMA mediated internalization. When systemically administered in a prostate tumor xenograft mouse model, PD-CTT1298-Cy5 selectively targets PSMA (+) tumors with significantly less accumulation in PSMA (−) tumors or upon blocking of the PSMA receptors. Moreover, the dendrimer clears rapidly from the off-target organs limiting systemic side-effects. Further, the conjugation of an anti-cancer agent, cabozantinib to the PSMA-targeted dendrimer translates to a significantly enhanced anti-proliferative activity in vitro compared to the free drug. These findings highlight the potential of PD-CTT1298 nanoplatform as a versatile approach for selective delivery of high payloads of potent chemotherapeutics to PCa, where dose related systemic side-effects are a major concern.","IntroductionThymomas are uncommon tumors that originate from epithelial cells of thymus and may have varying clinical course.Materials and MethodsA retrospective review of medical records of thymoma patients treated between January 2012 and April 2022 at our institute was conducted.Results There were a total of 23 patients (12 males and 11 females) with median age of 52 years (range, 33–77 years). Eleven patients (47.8%) had associated paraneoplastic syndromes of which 10 (43.5%) had myasthenia gravis and 1 (4.3%) had pure red cell aplasia. Average maximal tumor diameter was 62 mm (28–160 mm). Masaoka-Koga stage distribution was as follows: stage I ( n = 2, 8.7%), IIA ( n = 4, 17.4%), IIB ( n = 1, 4.3%), IIIA ( n = 2, 8.7%), IIIB ( n = 4, 17.4%), IVA ( n = 7, 30.4%), and IVB ( n = 3, 13.1%). The World Health Organization type B2 was the commonest histology ( n = 12, 52.17%), followed by B3 ( n =7, 30.4%), B1 ( n = 2, 8.7%), AB ( n = 1,4.3%), and A ( n = 1, 4.3%). Six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide regimen, 22 (95.6%) underwent surgery, and 1 patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. R0 resection was attained in 20 (91%) patients, R1 resection in 1 (4.5%) patient, and R2 in 1 (4.5%) patient. All operated patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy (45–60 Gy in 25–30 fractions). Four patients relapsed at a median duration of 14 months (2–26 months). At a median follow-up of 6 years, 5-year overall survival was 67.1% and 5-year progression-free survival was 66.6%. Local control at 5 years was 86.6%. ConclusionDespite majority of our patients presenting at an advanced stage, the local control rates are encouraging and reinforce multimodality approach.",0
"AbstractHigh-grade gliomas have poor prognoses with limited treatment options, typically maximal safe resection and adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Novel therapies often face challenges due to low brain penetrance and poor bioavailability. To address these issues, a conformable, compartmentalized polymeric implant called microMESH has been developed. microMESH provides localized, sustained release of drugs, small inhibitors, antibodies, and nanomedicines, enabling novel therapeutic combinations. When applied to the tumor margins, microMESH adheres to the tissue, releasing its therapeutic cargo over weeks and reducing systemic toxicity. Its biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and anti-tumor efficacy were tested on murine cancer cells (CT-2A) and orthotopic glioblastoma syngeneic models. Exposing primary bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDM) to CT-2A conditioned medium increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-4) by 2 times without significantly affecting the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), indicating that CT-2A cells tend to establish an immunosuppressive ‘cold’ tumor microenvironment. Next, the co-incubation of CT-2A cells with BMDM followed by the administration of the immune checkpoint inhibitor aCD47 resulted in a cancer cell viability drop by 50% already at 50 μg/ml aCD47 after 1 day. Additionally, pre-treatment with docetaxel (DTXL) further decreased cell viability, suggesting a synergism between aCD47 and the chemotherapeutic drug. Flow cytometry showed that 50 nM DTXL at 3 days post-incubation was responsible for a strong translocation of the ‘immunogenic dell death’ protein calreticulin on the cell membrane, potentially explaining the synergism. Over 2 months, the intracranially deployed microMESH biodegraded without inducing any toxic effect. In orthotopic CT-2A tumors, aCD47/DTXL–microMESH (0.75 mg/kg, single intracranial application) showed a 40-day survival compared to 22 days for iv DTXL (3 mg/kg qod), 24 days for ip aCD47 (5 mg/kg qod), and 18 days for untreated mice. microMESH helped identify and enabled novel combination therapies directly at the tumor bed, demonstrating superior efficacy over systemic therapies.","Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) serves a key immunosuppressive role as a negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. HPK1 loss-of-function is associated with augmentation of immune function and has demonstrated synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in syngeneic mouse cancer models. These data offer compelling evidence for the use of selective small molecule inhibitors of HPK1 in cancer immunotherapy. We identified a novel series of isoquinoline HPK1 inhibitors through fragment-based screening that displayed promising levels of biochemical potency and activity in functional cell-based assays. We used structure-based drug design to introduce key selectivity elements while simultaneously addressing pharmacokinetic liabilities. These efforts culminated in a molecule demonstrating subnanomolar biochemical inhibition of HPK1 and strong in vitro augmentation of TCR signaling in primary human T-cells. Further profiling of this molecule revealed excellent kinase selectivity (347/356 kinases <50% inhibition @ 0.1 μM), a favorable in vitro safety profile, and good projected human pharmacokinetics.",0
"Key PointsQuestionWhat therapies are best combined with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors to improve outcomes for patients with cancer who do not respond to PD-1 pathway inhibitor monotherapy?FindingsThis cross-sectional study of 98 clinical trials, which included 24 915 patients with metastatic cancer, compared objective response rates of PD-1 checkpoint immunotherapies used alone and in combination. Most combinations succeeded, given that the fold change from monotherapy ORR to combination ORR increased in 82.7% of trials. The highest observed Z score was for trials testing the combination of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens.MeaningIn this study, higher combination ORRs were found for chemotherapies; however, all classes of cancer agents could be successfully combined with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.","The peripheral somatosensory system bestows mammals with a diverse repertoire of sensory modalities: gentle touch, mechanical pain, itch, thermosensation, and proprioception. The cells and molecules that transduce many of these stimuli have already been characterized. But how somatosensory neurons transduce acutely painful mechanical forces is largely unknown – and remains one of the “final frontiers” of sensory neurobiology. In an effort to fill this gap in knowledge, recent studies have identified subpopulations of mechanical pain neurons and uncovered novel modulators of mechanical pain. These studies have greatly advanced our understanding of how noxious mechanical stimuli are detected in mammals. Here we discuss recent progress in noxious mechanosensation and highlight new behavioral methods to assess mechanical pain.",0
"AbstractAsthma exacerbation is a common clinical occurrence. The causal factors are not fully understood yet. Environmental pollution is linked to asthma exacerbation. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (MNP), an environmental pollutant, in asthma exacerbation. In this study, an airway allergy mouse model was established with ovalbumin as a specific antigen with or without the presence of MNP. The results showed that, in a mouse model, the intensity of airway allergy was significantly increased by exposure to MNP. RNAseq results showed an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated molecules and the Osm expression in airway epithelial cells of mice with airway allergy. Exposure of epithelial cells to MNP in culture induced the expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and ER stress associated molecules. The OSM receptor was expressed by macrophages. OSM could drive macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Inhibition of PERK, one of the key molecules of ER stress, or depletion of OSM receptor in macrophages, could effectively attenuate the MNP/ovalbumin protocol induced airway allergy. To sum up, by promoting ER stress, environmental pollutant MNP can cause airway epithelial cells to produce OSM. The latter induces macrophages to produce TNF-α, which can exacerbate airway allergy.","PurposePoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), a synthetic polymer known for its hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, has long been used in drug delivery systems to prevent non-specific protein adsorption and to extend the blood circulation time of drug carriers and protein drugs. However, PEG has several drawbacks including poor stability, accumulated toxicity, and immunogenicity induced by repeated injections. Recently, zwitterionic polymers, known for their super-hydrophilic and antifouling properties, have been considered excellent alternatives to PEG. In this study, we synthesized a new zwitterionic polymer from biocompatible sodium alginate and lysine.MethodsSodium alginate (Alg) was conjugated with lysine (Lys) using the EDC/sulfo-NHS chemistry to form a zwitterionic alginate derivative (Alg-Lys). The biocompatibility was evaluated using in vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal studies. After further conjugation of zwitterionic near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye ZW800, an in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging study was conducted to evaluate the ability of Alg-Lys to enhance blood circulation time.ResultsCharacterization of Alg-Lys showed that the carboxylic acid groups in Alg were completely replaced by Lys molecules. No cytotoxic effects were observed in the in vitro cytotoxicity tests of Alg-Lys-treated cancer cells and normal cells. Serum biochemical analysis confirmed the biocompatibility of Alg-Lys. ZW800-conjugated Alg-Lys exhibited strong fluorescence signals throughout the body 24 h after intravenous injection, whereas ZW800-conjugated Alg was rapidly removed from the body.ConclusionThe zwitterionic alginate derivative showed potential utility as a new delivery platform for imaging agents and drugs.",0
"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to develop an innovative treatment strategy utilizing antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that target the gene encoding protocadherin alpha 11 (PCDHA11) and to elucidate the role of PCDHA11 in gastric cancer cells.MethodsWe designed and screened 54 amido-bridged nucleic acid (AmNA)-modified ASOs, selecting them based on PCDHA11-knockdown efficacy, in vitro and in vivo activity, and off-target effects. We assessed the impact of AmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs on cellular functions and signaling pathways, and investigated the effects of Pcdha11 deficiency in mice.ResultsAmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs significantly reduced the proliferation of gastric cancer cells and other solid tumors, whereas overexpression of PCDHA11 enhanced cell proliferation. The selected ASOs inhibited cellular functions related to the metastatic potential of gastric cancer cells, including migration, invasiveness, spheroid formation, and cancer stemness. Our findings revealed that AmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs disrupted the AKT/mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. In mouse models of peritoneal metastasis (gastric and pancreatic cancer), systemic metastasis, and established subcutaneous tumors, administration of AmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs inhibited tumor growth. ASO treatment induced reversible, dose- and sequence-dependent liver damage. Pcdha11-deficient mice demonstrated normal reproductive, organ, and motor functions.ConclusionsAmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs offer a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer and other solid malignancies.","Despite advancements in medical care, surgical technologies, and the development of novel treatments over the past decade, the prognosis for patients with gastric cancer (GC) has only modestly improved. This is primarily due to the fact that the majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages or present with metastatic disease. Radical resection remains the cornerstone of potentially curative treatment, yet the overall 5-year survival rate remains below 35%. The management of GC varies globally, influenced by factors such as geographical disparities, patient comorbidities and performance status, surgical approaches, and available medical resources. Multidisciplinary collaboration and a multimodal treatment approach are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. Surgeons must stay updated on emerging surgical concepts and make informed decisions regarding patient selection, timing of intervention, and the adoption of appropriate surgical techniques to improve both quality of life and prognosis. This review aims to provide a surgical perspective on the management of GC across all stages, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach. Endoscopic resection may be a viable option for early GC in patients with minimal risk of lymph node metastasis, particularly in elderly patients with high surgical risk or severe comorbidities. For advanced GC, neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery could be a promising strategy to improve patient outcomes. Conversion surgery offers a potential survival benefit for patients who respond to treatment with tumor downstaging. The treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis remains challenging; however, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy combined with complete cytoreductive surgery or pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy may prolong survival or improve quality of life in highly selected patients.",1
"Aim: Cu2O nanoparticles were synthesized using an extract from S. latifolium algae (SLCu2O NPs). Their effect on PANC-1 cells and the expression of two drug resistance-related lncRNAs were evaluated in comparison with Arsenic trioxide.Materials & methods: SLCu2O NPs were characterized using XRD, SEM, and TEM microscopies. The effects of SLCu2O NPs on cell cytotoxicity, cell cycle, and apoptosis, and expression of two drug resistance-related lncRNAs were examined using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR, respectively.Results: SLCu2O NPs demonstrated anti-cancer properties against PANC-1 cells comparable to Arsenic trioxide, and the expression of lncRNAs increased upon treatment with them.Conclusion: SLCu2O NPs demonstrate anti-cancer properties against PANC-1 cells; however, using gene silencing strategies along with SLCu2O NPs is suggested.","Background: Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs have crucial regulatory roles in molecular pathways, and their dysregulation is associated with the pathogenesis of malignancies such as Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Therefore, we aimed to study the NEAT1 and CHROMR expression in DLBCL and explore their association with clinicopathological characteristics.Methods & materials: DLBCL and non-tumor lymph node specimens were obtained to assess the expression levels.Results: NEAT1 and CHROMR expressions were significantly increased in DLBCL, and were linked with the age of DLBCL patients (aged >60). NEAT1 and CHROMR overexpression may serve as moderate-to-good diagnostic biomarkers, with NEAT1 and CHROMR exhibiting area under the curve values of 0.781 and 0.831, respectively.",1
"Adoptive cellular therapy using chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has transformed immunotherapy by engineering T cells to target specific antigens on tumor cells. As the field continues to advance, pathology laboratories will play increasingly essential roles in the complicated multi-step process of CAR T-cell therapy. These include detection of targetable tumor antigens by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry at the time of disease diagnosis and the isolation and infusion of CAR T cells. Additional roles include: i) detecting antigen loss or heterogeneity that renders resistance to CAR T cells as well as identifying alternative targetable antigens on tumor cells, ii) monitoring the phenotype, persistence, and tumor infiltration properties of CAR T cells and the tumor microenvironment for factors that predict CAR T-cell therapy success, and iii) evaluating side effects and biomarkers of CAR T-cell cytotoxicity such as cytokine release syndrome. This review highlights existing technologies that are applicable to monitoring CAR T-cell persistence, target antigen identification, and loss. Also discussed are emerging technologies that address new challenges such as how to put a brake on CAR T cells. Although pathology laboratories have already provided companion diagnostic tests important in immunotherapy (eg, programmed death-ligand 1, microsatellite instability, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing), it draws attention to the exciting new translational research opportunities in adoptive cellular therapy.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody are promising treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but lack reliable biomarkers of response. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between pre-treatment body composition measures (muscle, adipose, etc.) and the prognosis of patients with HCC treated with ICIs.MethodsWe measured the total area of all skeletal muscles, total adipose tissue area, subcutaneous adipose tissue area, and visceral adipose tissue area at the level of the third lumbar vertebra using quantitative CT. Then, we calculated the skeletal muscle index, visceral adipose tissue index, subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI), and total adipose tissue index. The Cox regression model was used to determine the independent factors of the patient prognosis and construct a nomogram to predict survival. The consistency index (C-index) and calibration curve were used to determine the predictive accuracy and discrimination ability of the nomogram.ResultsMultivariate analysis revealed that the SATI (high- vs. low SATI; HR 0.251; 95% CI 0.109–0.577; P = 0.001), sarcopenia (sarcopenia vs. no sarcopenia; HR 2.171; 95% CI 1.100–4.284; P = 0.026), and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) (PVTT vs. No PVTT; HR 2.429; 95% CI 1. 197–4. 929; P = 0.014) were indicated as independent prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis indicated that Child–Pugh class (HR 0.477, 95% CI 0.257–0.885, P = 0.019) and sarcopenia (HR 2.376, 95% CI 1.335–4.230, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors of PFS. We established a nomogram using SATI, SA, and PVTT to predict the 12-month and 18-month survival probability of HCC patients treated with ICIs. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.754 (95% CI 0.686–0.823), and the calibration curve confirmed that the predicted results were in good agreement with the actual observations.ConclusionSubcutaneous adipose and sarcopenia are significant prognostic factors of patients with HCC receiving ICIs. A nomogram based on body composition parameters and clinical factors could well predict survival in HCC patients treated with ICIs.",0
"ABSTRACTLung cancer is a leading cause of global cancer mortality, often treated with chemotherapeutic agents. However, conventional approaches such as oral or intravenous administration of drugs yield low bioavailability and adverse effects. Nanotechnology has unlocked new gateways for delivering medicine to their target sites. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) are one of the nano-scaled delivery platforms that have been studied to exploit advantages of liposomes and polymers, enhancing stability, drug loading, biocompatibility and controlled release. Pulmonary administration of drug-loaded LPHNPs enables direct lung deposition, rapid onset of action and heightened efficacy at low doses of drugs. In this manuscript, we will review the potential of LPHNPs in management of lung cancer through pulmonary administration.","The integration of nanotechnology and synthetic biology could lay the framework for new classes of engineered biosensors that produce amplified readouts of disease states. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of this vision, here we present an engineered gene circuit that, in response to cancer-associated transcriptional deregulation, expresses heterologous enzyme biomarkers whose activity can be measured by nanoparticle sensors that generate amplified detection readouts. Specifically, we designed a AND-gate gene circuit that integrates the activity of two ovarian cancer-specific synthetic promoters to drive the expression of a heterologous protein output, secreted Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease, exclusively from within tumor cells. Nanoparticle probes were engineered to carry a TEV-specific peptide substrate in order to measure the activity of the circuit-generated enzyme to yield amplified detection signals measurable in the urine or blood. We applied our integrated sense-and-respond system in a mouse model of disseminated ovarian cancer, where we demonstrated measurement of circuit-specific TEV protease activity both in vivo using exogenously administered nanoparticle sensors and ex vivo using quenched fluorescent probes. We envision that this work will lay the foundation for how synthetic biology and nanotechnology can be meaningfully integrated to achieve next-generation engineered biosensors.",1
"AbstractMicrosatellite instability (MSI) is an important biomarker in cancer. While routine methods can detect MSI in certain tumor types, in other tumor types the results may be incorrect due to differences in the MSI loci pattern. Here, we report the case of a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with confirmed MSI by two independent next-generation sequencing tests, but not by routine methods, who had progression on pembrolizumab. Comparison of the patient’s MSI loci patterns with MSI+ colorectal adenocarcinoma samples showed a lower fraction of unstable loci, low resolution of a second peak in the repeat length spectrum of unstable short tandem repeats in the patient's sample, and a lower length of indels (3.7 vs 4.5 base pairs, p < 0.01).","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a dismal 5‐year survival of < 7%, despite the addition of immunotherapy to first‐line chemotherapy. Specific tumor biomarkers, such as delta‐like ligand 3 (DLL3) and schlafen11 (SLFN11), may enable the selection of more efficacious, novel immunomodulating targeted treatments like bispecific T‐cell engaging monoclonal antibodies (tarlatamab) and chemotherapy with PARP inhibitors. However, obtaining a tissue biopsy sample can be challenging in SCLC. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have the potential to provide molecular insights into a patient's cancer through a “simple” blood test. CTCs have been studied for their prognostic ability in SCLC; however, their value in guiding treatment decisions is yet to be elucidated. This review explores novel and promising targeted therapies in SCLC, summarizes current knowledge of CTCs in SCLC, and discusses how CTCs can be utilized for precision medicine.",1
"IntroductionTracing the histological origin of metastatic renal cancer (MRC) and locating the pathological root cause lead to precise treatment and improved prognosis.Material and methodsA total of 3336 patient cases with clear tissue origins from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were screened as experimental data material and feature selection was performed using the differential expression method; the random forest (RF) algorithm was improved to establish a medical retrospective heterogeneous filtered feature selection random forest weighted (ReliefFk_RFw) model to locate tissue origins.ResultsThe differential expression analysis method screened 60 signature genes with good differential expression for tracing tissue origins (kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Compared with traditional machine learning (support vector machine, decision tree, RF) models, the ReliefFk_RFw algorithm increased the average accuracy from 98.65%, 98.79% and 98.57% to 99.53%, the average precision from 95.58%, 96.40% and 96.54% to 99.36%, and the average sensitivity from 97.03%, 96.61% and 96.76% to 98.89%, mean specificity from 99.50%, 99.39% and 99.35% to 99.90%, and mean F1 score from 96.30%, 96.50% and 96.64% to 99.11%. The highest accuracy in localizing the origin of primary pancreatic cancer was achieved with 100.00% for different models of retrospective metrics.ConclusionsThe improved ReliefFk_RFw model is best for comprehensive assessment and can be used to trace the origin of MRC tissue to assist physicians in diagnosis and treatment.","Aims/hypothesis:Surviving beta cells in type 1 diabetes respond to inflammation by upregulating programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) to engage immune cell programmed death-1 (PD-1) and limit destruction by self-reactive immune cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo can serve as biomarkers of beta cell health and contribute to islet intercellular communication. We hypothesized that the inflammatory milieu of type 1 diabetes increases PD-L1 in beta cell EV cargo and that EV PD-L1 may protect beta cells against immune-mediated cell death.Methods:Beta cell lines and human islets were treated with proinflammatory cytokines to model the proinflammatory type 1 diabetes microenvironment. EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography and analysed via immunoblot, flow cytometry, and ELISA. EV PD-L1: PD-1 binding was assessed using a competitive binding assay and in vitro functional assays testing the ability of EV PD-L1 to inhibit NOD CD8 T cells. Plasma EV and soluble PD-L1 were assayed in plasma of individuals with islet autoantibody positivity (Ab+) or recent-onset type 1 diabetes and compared to non-diabetic controls.Results:PD-L1 protein colocalized with tetraspanin-associated proteins intracellularly and was detected on the surface of beta cell EVs. 24-h IFN-α or IFN-ɣ treatment induced a two-fold increase in EV PD-L1 cargo without a corresponding increase in number of EVs. IFN exposure predominantly increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of beta cell EVs and beta cell EV PD-L1 showed a dose-dependent capacity to bind PD-1. Functional experiments demonstrated specific effects of beta cell EV PD-L1 to suppress proliferation and cytotoxicity of murine CD8 T cells. Plasma EV PD-L1 levels were increased in islet Ab+ individuals, particularly in those with single Ab+, Additionally, in from individuals with either Ab+ or type 1 diabetes, but not in controls, plasma EV PD-L1 positively correlated with circulating C-peptide, suggesting that higher EV-PD-L1 could be protective for residual beta cell function.Conclusions/interpretation:IFN exposure increases PD-L1 on the beta cell EV surface. Beta cell EV PD-L1 binds PD1 and inhibits CD8 T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Circulating EV PD-L1 is higher in islet autoantibody positive patients compared to controls. Circulating EV PD-L1 levels correlate with residual C-peptide at different stages in type 1 diabetes progression. These findings suggest that EV PD-L1 could contribute to heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes progression and residual beta cell function and raise the possibility that EV PD-L1 could be exploited as a means to inhibit immune-mediated beta cell death.",0
"AbstractBiomaterials often have subtle properties that ultimately drive their bespoke performance. Given this nuanced structure–function behavior, the standard scientific approach of one experiment at a time or design of experiment methods is largely inefficient for the discovery of complex biomaterials. More recently, high-throughput experimentation coupled with machine learning methods has matured beyond expert users allowing scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds to access these powerful data science tools. As a result, we now have the opportunity to strategically utilize all available data from high-throughput experiments to train efficacious models and map the structure-function behavior of biomaterials for their discovery. Herein, we discuss this necessary shift to data-driven determination of structure–function properties of biomaterials as we highlight how machine learning is leveraged in identifying physicochemical cues for biomaterials in tissue engineering, gene delivery, drug delivery, protein stabilization, and antifouling materials. We also discuss data-mining approaches that are coupled with machine learning to map biomaterial functions that reduce the load on experimental approaches for faster biomaterial discovery. Ultimately, harnessing the prowess of machine learning will lead to accelerated discovery and development of optimal biomaterial designs.","Aging is associated with immunological changes that compromise response to infections and vaccines, exacerbate inflammatory diseases and can potentially mitigate tissue repair. Even so, age-related changes to the immune response to tissue damage and regenerative medicine therapies remain unknown. Here, it is characterized how aging induces changes in immunological signatures that inhibit tissue repair and therapeutic response to a clinical regenerative biological scaffold derived from extracellular matrix. Signatures of inflammation and interleukin (IL)-17 signaling increased with injury and treatment both locally and regionally in aged animals, and computational analysis uncovered age-associated senescent-T cell communication that promotes type 3 immunity in T cells. Local inhibition of type 3 immune activation using IL17-neutralizing antibodies improves healing and restores therapeutic response to the regenerative biomaterial, promoting muscle repair in older animals. These results provide insights into tissue immune dysregulation that occurs with aging that can be targeted to rejuvenate repair.",1
"Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rather frequent, little is known about the molecular pathways underlying its development, progression, and prognosis. In the current study, we comprehensively analyzed the deferentially expressed metabolism-related genes (MRGs) in HCC based on TCGA datasets attempting to discover the potentially prognostic genes in HCC. The up-regulated MRGs were further subjected to analyze their prognostic values and protein expressions. Twenty-seven genes were identified because their high expressions were significant in OS, PFS, DFS, DSS, and HCC tumor samples. They were then used for GO, KEGG, methylation, genetics changes, immune infiltration analyses. Moreover, we established a prognostic model in HCC using univariate assays and LASSO regression based on these MRGs. Additionally, we also found that SLC38A1, an amino acid metabolism closely related transporter, was a potential prognostic gene in HCC, and its function in HCC was further studied using experiments. We found that the knockdown of SLC38A1 notably suppressed the growth and migration of HCC cells. Further studies revealed that SLC38A1 modulated the development of HCC cells by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling via glutamine mediated energy metabolism. In conclusion, this study identified the potentially prognostic MRGs in HCC and uncovered that SLC38A1 regulated HCC development and progression by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling via glutamine mediated energy metabolism, which might provide a novel marker and potential therapeutic target in HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05360-3.","Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid for the growth and survival of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Many cancers are addicted to glutamine, and as a result, targeting glutamine metabolism has been explored clinically as a therapeutic approach. Glutamine-catalyzing enzymes are highly expressed in primary and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the nature of the glutamine-associated pathways in this aggressive cancer type has not been elucidated. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential of a broad glutamine antagonist, DRP-104 (sirpiglenastat), in HNSCC tumors and aimed at shedding light on glutamine-dependent pathways in this disease. We observed a potent antitumoral effect of sirpiglenastat in HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC xenografts. We conducted a whole-genome CRISPR screen and metabolomics analyses to identify mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to glutamine metabolism blockade. These approaches revealed that glutamine metabolism blockade results in the rapid buildup of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via autophagy nutrient-sensing pathways. Finally, our analysis demonstrated that GPX4 mediates the protection of HNSCC cells from accumulating toxic lipid peroxides; hence, glutamine blockade sensitizes HNSCC cells to ferroptosis cell death upon GPX4 inhibition. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of sirpiglenastat in HNSCC and establish a novel link between glutamine metabolism and ferroptosis, which may be uniquely translated into targeted glutamine-ferroptosis combination therapies.",1
"AbstractBreast cancer is the primary cause of cancer‐related death in women worldwide. Breast cancer subtypes are characterized by different gene expression patterns, which drive their prognostic factors and therapeutic options. Among them, triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the deadliest due to its aggressiveness, high rate of early recurrence and distant metastases, and limited therapeutic options. Despite the recent approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) or its ligand (PD‐L1) for the treatment of TNBC patients with a locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic tumor expressing PD‐L1, their response rate is very modest. It is reported that polymeric nanoparticle (NP)‐based cancer vaccines, co‐entrapping tumor‐associated antigens, Toll‐like receptor ligands and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1 by dendritic cells, sensitized TNBC to the agonist immune checkpoint OX40, inhibiting tumor growth and increasing overall survival. This anti‐tumor immune‐mediated effect is also observed in a luminal type of mammary cancer similar to human disease. Therefore, these synergistic anticancer effects of αOX40 and the antigen‐specific adaptive immunity induced by nanovaccine‐mediated TGF‐β silencing may guide the development of novel combination regimens able to improve the response rate to this aggressive tumor.","The accurate identification and prioritization of antigenic peptides is crucial for the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies. Publicly available pipelines to predict clinical neoantigens do not allow direct integration of mass spectrometry immunopeptidomics data, which can uncover antigenic peptides derived from various canonical and noncanonical sources. To address this, we present an end-to-end clinical proteogenomic pipeline, called NeoDisc, that combines state-of-the-art publicly available and in-house software for immunopeptidomics, genomics and transcriptomics with in silico tools for the identification, prediction and prioritization of tumor-specific and immunogenic antigens from multiple sources, including neoantigens, viral antigens, high-confidence tumor-specific antigens and tumor-specific noncanonical antigens. We demonstrate the superiority of NeoDisc in accurately prioritizing immunogenic neoantigens over recent prioritization pipelines. We showcase the various features offered by NeoDisc that enable both rule-based and machine-learning approaches for personalized antigen discovery and neoantigen cancer vaccine design. Additionally, we demonstrate how NeoDisc’s multiomics integration identifies defects in the cellular antigen presentation machinery, which influence the heterogeneous tumor antigenic landscape.",0
"Purpose:Despite family history being an established risk factor for prostate cancer, the role of a broader definition of family history inclusive of not just prostate cancer but other genetically related malignancies has not been investigated in the active surveillance population. Here, we evaluate the impact of an expanded definition of family history on active surveillance outcomes.Materials and Methods:Patients undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1997-2019 with detailed data available on family cancer history were identified. Primary outcome was biopsy progression-free survival, and secondary outcomes were treatment-free survival, adverse pathological features at prostatectomy, and biochemical recurrence after treatment. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.Results:Among 855 evaluable patients, 300 (35.1%) patients had any family history of prostate cancer, and 95 (11.1%) had a family history of related malignancies suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome. Family history of prostate cancer alone was not associated with biopsy progression, whereas family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome was associated with a significantly increased risk of biopsy progression (HR 1.43, 95%CI 1.01-2.02), independent of other known clinicopathological risk factors in multivariable analysis. Similarly, family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome was associated with significantly lower treatment-free survival (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.14-2.18) in multivariable analysis. No significant association was found between family history and adverse features on surgical pathology or biochemical recurrence.Conclusions:An expanded family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome is an independent predictor of biopsy progression during active surveillance. Men with such a family history may still be offered active surveillance but should be counseled regarding the higher risk of disease progression.","Background and purposeThe intricate mechanisms underlying intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment remain largely elusive. Recently, attention has shifted towards exploring the intercellular signaling mediated by exosomal long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) within this context. This comprehensive systematic review aims to elucidate the functional paradigm of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer.Materials and methodsThe review provides a comprehensive narrative of lncRNA definition, characteristics, as well as the formation, sorting, and uptake processes of exosome-derived lncRNAs. Additionally, it describes comprehensive technology for exosome research and nucleic acid drug loading. This review further systematically examines the cellular origins, functional roles, and underlying mechanisms of exosome-derived lncRNAs in recipient cells within the cancer setting.ResultsThe functional paradigm of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer mainly depends on the source cells and sorting mechanism of exosomal lncRNAs, the recipient cells and uptake mechanisms of exosomal lncRNAs, and the specific molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in recipient cells. The source cells of exosomal lncRNAs mainly involved in the current review included tumor cells, cancer stem cells, normal cells, macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts.ConclusionThis synthesis of knowledge offers valuable insights for accurately identifying exosomal lncRNAs with potential as tumor biomarkers. Moreover, it aids in the selection of appropriate targeting strategies and preclinical models, thereby facilitating the clinical translation of exosomal lncRNAs as promising therapeutic targets against cancer. Through a comprehensive understanding of the functional role of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer, this review paves the way for advancements in personalized medicine and improved treatment outcomes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05273-1.",0
"BackgroundDespite advances in precision medicine for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), biomarker testing for these therapies remains frequently underused, delayed, and inequitable. Pulmonologists often play a critical role in the initial diagnostic steps for patients with lung cancer, and previous data show variability in their knowledge and practices regarding biomarker testing. The purpose of this study is to better understand how pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care.Research QuestionWith the increasing importance of biomarker testing and precision medicine, how do pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care?Study DesignAn electronic survey consisting of 31 items focused on attitudes and practices regarding diagnostic steps for NSCLC was randomly distributed to a sample of practicing pulmonologists in the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) analytics database. Inferential statistics were performed using χ2 tests and multivariable logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 401 pulmonologists responded to the survey. Most (92%) were general pulmonologists, and more than one-half (62%) indicated they order biomarker testing. Longer practice tenure, higher case volumes, and participation in a multidisciplinary tumor board were associated with ordering biomarkers (P < .05). Pulmonology was identified to have the leading responsibility for the initial diagnostic biopsy by most respondents (83%) and less often for staging (45%), leading discussions about biomarker testing with patients (28%), and for ordering biomarkers (22%). The most common reasons for not ordering biomarkers included the following: oncology was responsible (84%), it was not within their scope of practice (46%), or lack of the necessary knowledge (51%).InterpretationThis study shows that pulmonologists vary in their practices for ordering biomarkers, and many defer this responsibility to oncology. Despite the role of bronchoscopy and pulmonology societal guidelines for staging, many defer leadership of this process. Many pulmonologists lack the necessary resources and multidisciplinary infrastructure likely required to efficiently accomplish biomarker testing.","AbstractBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with severe immune-related adverse events (s-irAEs) that result in hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, treatment discontinuation, or death. This study examined the impact of s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies on clinical outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsData were derived from ConcertAI Patient360 NSCLC, a US-based electronic medical record database, between January 2012 and May 2021. Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC and received ICI-containing therapy. s-irAEs and management actions were abstracted from unstructured EHR data from ICI initiation through the earliest of 100 days after ICI discontinuation, start of a non-ICI-containing regimen, loss to follow up, end of study period, or death. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies, and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS).ResultsThe study included 3211 patients. Median (IQR) age was 67 (60-73) years, and 44.9% were female. Most patients (61.6%) initiated ICIs as first-line therapy; half (50.1%) initiated ICIs as monotherapy, with nivolumab monotherapy (29.5%) as the most common initial ICI-containing regimen in any line. Overall, 8.6% of patients experienced s-irAEs, most often diarrhea (3.5%), pneumonitis (1.4%), and rash (1.3%). Among patients who experienced at least one s-irAEs, over half (57.4%) were hospitalized, and 71.8% were treated with corticosteroids, any time after the occurrence of their first s-irAEs. Median rwPFS was 4.9 (95%CI, 4.6-5.2) months, and median rwOS was 13.6 (12.6-14.7) months from ICI initiation. rwPFS and rwOS were comparable between patients with s-irAEs vs patients without s-irAEs when s-irAEs were first managed with anti-cancer treatment interruptions. Patients with s-irAEs had a 53% (22.3%-91.4%) higher risk of death than patients without s-irAEs when s-irAEs initially required corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants, and a 61% (37.9%-87.9%) higher risk of death when s-irAEs first required hospitalization or ED admission.ConclusionThe impact of s-irAEs on clinical outcomes may depend on the initial intervention required to manage the adverse event. s-irAEs were associated with worse outcomes when they initially required hospital/ED admission, corticosteroids, or other immunosuppression.",1
"AbstractBackgroundThis study characterizes patient and health-care professional perspectives regarding medical cannabis use at a National Cancer Institute–Designated Cancer Center. Data evaluated included the prevalence and patterns of and reasons for cannabis use.MethodsPatients with cancer undergoing treatment were recruited into a cross-sectional survey as part of a national National Cancer Institute–funded effort. Participants completed a survey about cannabis use, reasons for use, and types of cannabis. A health-care professional survey was also conducted to explore perspectives regarding patients’ use of cannabis.ResultsA total of 313 patients with cancer (mean [SD] age = 60.7 [12.8] years) completed the survey (43% response rate) between 2021 and 2022. Of the respondents, 58% were female; identified as White (61%) and Black (23%); and had diverse cancer diagnoses. Nearly half of respondents (43%) had previously used cannabis, one-quarter (26%) had used cannabis since their cancer diagnosis, and almost 1 in 6 (17%) were actively using cannabis at the time of survey completion. The most common modes of ingestion were gummies (33%) and smoking (30%). The most commonly reported reasons for use were insomnia (46%), pain (41%), and mood (39%). For the 164 health-care professionals who completed the survey (25% response rate), the majority agreed that cannabis use (72%) is safe and beneficial for patients (57%). Four in 10 (39%) health-care professionals felt comfortable providing guidance to patients about cannabis use; however, only 1 in 8 (13%) felt knowledgeable about the topic of cannabis.ConclusionsApproximately one-sixth of patients with cancer receiving treatment actively use cannabis for management of various cancer symptoms. Perceptions about cannabis use and education varied widely among health-care professionals.","BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common leukemia with low cure rate and poor prognosis among pediatric patients. The regulation of AML immune microenvironment and methylation remains to be explored. Pediatric and adult AML patients differ significantly in epigenetic factors, and the efficiency of treatment modalities varies between the two groups of patients.MethodsWe collected mRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation data from pediatric AML patients across multiple databases. Differentially expression genes were identified, and a gene–miRNA regulatory network was constructed. Prognostic risk models were established by integrating LASSO and Cox regression, and a nomogram was generated. Based on this model, we investigated tumor-infiltrating immune cells and cell communication, analyzing the biological functions and pathways associated with prognostic factors. Furthermore, the relationships between all prognostic factors and gene modules were explored, and the impact of these factors on treatment modalities was determined.ResultsWe developed an efficient prognostic risk model and identified HOXA9, SORT1, SH3BP5, mir-224 and mir-335 as biomarkers. We validated these findings in an external dataset and observed a correlation between age and risk in pediatric patients. AML samples with lower risk scores have a better prognosis and higher expression of immune-upregulated biomarkers, and have lower immune scores. Furthermore, we detected discrepancies in immune cell infiltration and interactions between high- and low-risk group samples, which affected the efficacy of immunotherapy. We evaluated all prognostic factors and predicted the effect of immunotherapy and medicine.ConclusionThis study comprehensively investigated the role of methylation signature genes in pediatric AML at the level of genomes and transcriptomes. The research aims to enhance the risk stratification, prognosis evaluation and assessment of treatment effectiveness of AML patients. This study also highlight the uniqueness of pediatric AML and foster the development of new immunotherapy and targeted therapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05284-y.",0
"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signalling pathway is a crucial path in cancer for cell survival and thus represents an intriguing arget for new paediatric anti-cancer drugs. However, the unique clinical toxicities of targeting this pathway (resulting in hyperglycaemia) difficulties combining with chemotherapy, rarity of mutations in childhood tumours and concomitant mutations have resulted in major barriers to clinical translation of these inhibitors in treating both adults and children.Mutations in PIK3CA predict response to PI3-K inhibitors in adult cancers. The same mutations occur in children as in adults, but they are significantly less frequent in paediatrics. In children, high-grade gliomas, especially diffuse midline gliomas (DMG), have the highest incidence of PIK3CA mutations. New mutation-specific PI3-K inhibitors reduce toxicity from on-target PI3-Kα wild-type activity.The mTOR inhibitor everolimus is approved for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. In paediatric cancers, mTOR inhibitors have been predominantly evaluated by academia, without an overall strategy, in empiric, mutation-agnostic clinical trials with very low response rates to monotherapy. Therefore, future trials of single agent or combination strategies of mTOR inhibitors in childhood cancer should be supported by very strong biological rationale and preclinical data.Further preclinical evaluation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibitors is required. Similarly, even where there is an AKT mutation (~0.1%), the role of AKT inhibitors in paediatric cancers remains unclear.Patient advocates strongly urged analysing and conserving data from every child participating in a clinical trial.A priority is to evaluate mutation-specific, central nervous system-penetrant PI3-K inhibitors in children with DMG in a rational biological combination. The choice of combination, should be based on the genomic landscape for example PTEN loss and resistance mechanisms supported by preclinical data. However, in view of the very rare populations involved, innovative regulatory approaches are needed to generate data for an indication.","PurposeThis study was designed to evaluate the role and expression of MEK5 signalling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and to determine the relevance of MEK5 and mTOR signalling in ccRCC.MethodsThe expression of MEK5 was compared between ccRCC and normal tissues using the ONCOMINE and TCGA databases. MEK5 expression was evaluated in 14 human ccRCC samples. CCK8, wound-healing, and clone formation assays were performed to examine the cell proliferation, migration, and clone formation abilities of ccRCC cells treated with MEK5 and the inhibitor BIX02189. Furthermore, Western blotting was performed to verify the regulation and influence of MEK5 on the mTOR signalling pathway. Finally, a murine subcutaneous tumour model was constructed, and the effect and safety of BIX02189 were evaluated in vivo.ResultsThe ONCOMINE and TCGA databases indicated that MEK5 expression in ccRCC was significantly higher than that in normal tissues, which was further confirmed in clinical specimens. MEK5 knockdown markedly inhibited ccRCC cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, whereas MEK5 overexpression resulted in the opposite results. Western blotting revealed that overexpression of MEK5 could further activate the mTOR signalling pathway. Moreover, the MEK5 inhibitor BIX02189 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, induced apoptosis, and effectively inhibited cell migration and clone formation. BIX02189 also showed an excellent antitumor effect and a favourable safety profile in murine models.ConclusionsMEK5 expression was aberrantly increased in ccRCC, which activated the mTOR signalling pathway and regulated cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and clone formation in ccRCC. Targeted inhibition of MEK5 represents a promising new strategy in patients with ccRCC.",1

Given the increased use of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC), we evaluated frailty and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) among older adults with aNSCLC receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted therapy.MethodsPatients aged ≥ 65 with aNSCLC starting systemic therapy with non-curative intent underwent geriatric assessments over 6 months. We developed a deficit-accumulation frailty index to categorize patients as robust, pre-frail, or frail. To evaluate associations between frailty and KPS with OS, we used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for race, insurance, and treatment. We used logistic regression to evaluate hospitalizations, functional decline, and severe toxicity.ResultsAmong 155 patients (median age 73), 45.8% were robust, 36.1% pre-frail, and 18.2% frail; 34.8% had a KPS ≥ 90, 32.9% had a KPS of 80, and 32.3% had a KPS ≤ 70. The median OS was 17.9 months. Pre-frail/frail patients had worse OS compared to robust patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.09, 95% CI, 1.31-3.34) and were more likely to be hospitalized (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.21, 95% CI, 1.09-4.48), functionally decline (adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI, 1.09-4.78), and experience grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicity (adjusted OR 5.18, 95% CI, 1.02-26.03). KPS was only associated with OS.Conclusions Our frailty index was associated with OS, hospitalization, functional decline, and hematologic AEs among older adults with aNSCLC receiving systemic therapies, while KPS was only associated with OS. Pretreatment frailty assessment may help identify older adults at risk for poor outcomes to optimize decision-making and supportive care.",1
"ABSTRACTExtracellular Vesicles (EVs) became a focus of clinical research when experimental and pre-clinical studies showed that they mimic their parent cells’ regenerative and therapeutic effects and their cargo carries disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Since the publication of data forms an endpoint of the study, this review specifically focused on the published clinical trials done with EVs. For brevity, this review was restricted to the last 10 years. Unexpectedly, the literature search showed that very few clinical trials assessing the therapeutic applications of EVs were published in this period indicating that they have not reached their desired endpoint. Conversely, most studies showed the potential of EVs present in various biofluids as a promising source of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for various diseases, and predictive markers to assess the effectiveness of therapy. This stark difference in the numbers could perhaps be due to the time-consuming regulatory processes involved in the clinical-grade preparation and characterization of EVs, and the determination of their safety and effective dose regimens. One wonders whether fast-tracking regulatory affairs could help accelerate the therapeutic use of EVs. This aspect needs urgent attention.","ABSTRACTPeople living with cancer have a profound need to understand any potential negative impacts of treatment on their everyday lives and whether the treatment itself could cause other long-term health challenges. This podcast brings together the perspectives of a patient, patient advocates and an oncologist, to highlight opportunities to better support people in understanding the possible side effects of a treatment and potential impact on quality of life. In addition to bridging gaps between the perspectives of healthcare providers and patients, it may be helpful to support people in interpreting relevant clinical trial findings. With this in mind, two accompanying visual guides use patient-friendly language to help people understand how safety and quality of life are measured in clinical trials.",1
"IntroductionThe urinary microbiome (UMB) includes living bacteria, their genomes, and their products from interactions with the host environment. A “core” UMB could potentially exist, with variations between age and sex groups. Changes in UMB composition have been associated with benign urological disorders, but also with urologic cancers. Mechanisms through which UMB can trigger and maintain cancer can be local inflammation and interaction with immune system.Aim of the studyTo describe the association between UMB and development of urologic cancers.MethodsA non-systematic literature review identified recently published studies (last 5 years), involving human patients, dealing with UMB. The database used for this review was PubMed, and the identified studies served as the base for a narrative analysis of the literature that explored the potential associations between UMB and urological cancers.ResultsIn bladder cancer (BC), UMB may play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (and thus to progression to metastasis), as well as in effectiveness of BCG response rate. BC is also associated with changes in UMB, with bacterial richness indices increased in cancer groups compared to non-neoplastic groups and being different between NMIBC vs MIBC patients. In prostate cancer (PCa), there is an abundance in proinflammatory bacteria and uropathogens. In regard to renal cell carcinoma (RCC), penile cancer and testicular cancer there are still too few studies to draw significant conclusions about its relationship with the UMB.ConclusionsGaining a deeper understanding of UMB role in urologic tumors could aid in the development of new therapies and improve classification of patients’ risk.","AbstractThe aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role of circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection in the surgical assessment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with thrombi.Nine patients diagnosed with renal mass and thrombi were enrolled from June 2018 to January 2019. Blood samples were collected for CTC detection using SE-iFISH assay. CD45, DAPI, programmed death ligand 1, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with the centromere of chromosome 8 (CEP8) were immune-stained for analysis. Patient demographics, clinical features, pathological characteristics, and CTC detection results were extracted for analysis.Seven of 9 patients (77.8%) had 12 detectable CTCs, 5 of which were with CEP8-positive signal ≥5 and the others were CEP8-positive signal = 3. All 3 patients (100%) with IVC invasion had detectable CTCs, whereas CTCs were detected in 4 of 6 patients (66.7%) without IVC invasion. CEP8 analysis revealed that CTCs in IVC invasion patients were all of CEP8-positive signal ≥5 status, whereas only half of the CTCs in patients without IVC invasion were of CEP8-positive signal ≥5 pattern.In conclusion, both CTC subtype and total CTC number may serve as a marker for predicting inferior vena cava invasion in RCC patients.",1
"BackgroundDelivering stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with multiple oligometastases represents a challenge for clinical and technical reasons. We aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with SABR and the impact of tumor volume on survival.Materials and methodsWe included all the patients treated with single course SABR for 3 to 5 extracranial oligometastases. All patients were treated with the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique with ablative intent. End-points of the analysis were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), local control (LC) and toxicity.Results136 patients were treated from 2012 to 2020 on 451 oligometastases. Most common primary tumor was colorectal cancer (44.1%) followed by lung cancer (11.8%). A total of 3, 4 and 5 lesions were simultaneously treated in 102 (75.0%), 26 (19.1%), and 8 (5.9%) patients, respectively. Median total tumor volume (TTV) was 19.1 cc (range 0.6–245.1). With a median follow-up of 25.0 months, OS at 1 and 3 years was 88.4% and 50.2%, respectively. Increasing TTV was independent predictive factor of worse OS (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.18–4.78, p = 0.014) and PFS (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.05–2.54; p = 0.028). Median OS was 80.6 months if tumor volume was ≤ 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 93.6% and 77.5%, respectively), and 31.1 months if TTV was higher than 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 86.7% and 42.3%, respectively). Rates of LC at 1 and 3 years were 89.3% and 76.5%. In terms of toxicity, no grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported both in the acute and late settings.ConclusionWe demonstrated the impact of tumor volume on survival and disease control of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with single course SABR.","BackgroundRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 80–90% of all kidney tumors and about 15–25% of patients will develop distant metastases. Systemic therapy represents the standard of care for metastatic patients, but stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) may play a relevant role in the oligoprogressive setting, defined as the progression of few metastases during an ongoing systemic therapy on a background of otherwise stable disease. Aim of the present study was to analyze the outcome of RCC patients treated with SABR on oligoprogressive metastases.Materials and methodsIn this monocenter study, we analyzed patients affected by RCC treated with SABR on a maximum of 5 cranial or extracranial oligoprogressive sites of disease. Endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity.ResultsWe included 74 oligoprogressions (26 intracranial and 48 extracranial) and 57 SABR treatments in 44 patients. Most common concomitant treatments were sunitinib (28, 49.1%), pazopanib (12, 21.0%) and nivolumab (11, 19.3%). Median follow-up was 19.0 months, and 1- and 2-year OS rates were 79.2% and 57.3%, respectively. Repeated SABR was a positive predictive factor for OS (p = 0.034). Median PFS was 9.8 months, with 1- and 2-year rates of 43.2% and 25.8%. At multivariable analysis, disease-free interval (p = 0.022) and number of treated metastases (p = 0.007) were significant for PFS. About 80% of patients continued the ongoing systemic therapy 1- and 2-years after SABR with no grade 3 or 4 toxicities.Conclusionswe confirmed the efficacy and safety of SABR for oligoprogression from RCC, with the potential to ablate resistant metastases and to prolong the ongoing systemic therapy.",1
"Fasting and fasting-mimicking conditions modulate tumor metabolism and remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME), which could be exploited for the treatment of tumors. A body of evidence demonstrates that fasting and fasting-mimicking conditions can kill cancer cells, or sensitize them to the antitumor activity of standard-of-care drugs while protecting normal cells against their toxic side effects. Pre- and clinical data also suggest that immune responses are involved in these therapeutic effects. Therefore, there is increasing interest in evaluating the impact of fasting-like conditions in the efficacy of antitumor therapies based on the restoration or activation of antitumor immune responses. Here, we review the recent progress in the intersection of fasting-like conditions and current cancer treatments, with an emphasis on cancer immunotherapy.","Parasites and cancers have some common antigens. Much scientific evidence in the human population, animal models, and in vitro experiments exhibit that parasites have significant anti-cancer effects. The larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzy, Plasmodium’s, and Trichinella spiralis are among the parasites that have been subjects of anti-cancer research in the last decades. Anti-tumor effects of parasites may be due to the direct impact of the parasites per se or indirectly due to the immune response raised against common antigens between malignant cells and parasites. This manuscript reviews the anti-cancer effects of parasites and possible mechanisms of these effects. Options for using parasites or their antigens for cancer treatment in the future have been discussed.Graphical abstract",1
"BackgroundPatients with glioma have limited treatment options and experience poor prognoses. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the relevance of WSC domain-containing 2 (WSCD2) expression to glioma, clinicopathological characteristics, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TILs), and patient prognosis.MethodsWe analyzed WSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues and patient survival using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. Furthermore, the relationship between the expressions of WSCD2 mRNA and TILs in gliomas was evaluated utilizing the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Lastly, we employed multiplex immunohistochemistry to detect the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues.ResultsWSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues was lower than that in tissues of benign brain disease. High WSCD2 mRNA expression was also significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, WSCD2 mRNA expression was correlated with TIL expression in glioma; however, no such relationship was detected between the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues. Cox regression multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that WSCD2 expression in glioma tissues could be an independent prognostic factor.ConclusionThis study highlights the correlation between WSCD2 expression and TILs and demonstrates the prognostic significance of WSCD2 in glioma. Furthermore, our results suggest that WSCD2 may be a potential immunotherapy target in glioma.","AbstractBackgroundPediatric high-grade gliomas, such as diffuse midline glioma (DMG), have a poor prognosis and lack curative treatments. Current research models of DMG primarily rely on human DMG cell lines cultured in vitro or xenografted into the brains of immunodeficient mice. However, these models are insufficient to recapitulate the complex cell-cell interactions between DMG and the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME), therefore fall short of accurately reflecting how efficacious therapeutic agents or combinations will be in the clinical setting.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed a neuroimmune-competent brain/tumor fusion organoid model system consisting entirely of human cells to investigate the interactions between DMG cells and the primary innate immune cells of the brain, microglia, in the TIME at both cellular and subcellular levels. We generated microglia-containing brain organoids (MiCBOs) that carry morphologically mature, motile microglia and multiple subtypes of neurons to mimic the brain tumor microenvironment. These organoids were then fused with H3K27M mutant, TP53P27R/K132R DMG tumor spheroids to create the MiCBO-tumor fusion (MiCBO-TF) model.ResultsWe utilized live imaging methods to simultaneously track the mobility of microglial cell bodies and the motility of their process, as well as the behavior of tumor cells within a human brain tissue environment. Our MiCBO-TF model faithfully recapitulated the diffuse infiltration pattern of DMG into brain tissue and revealed that microglial mobility and interactions with tumor cells are highly influenced by external factors and the surrounding tissue environment.ConclusionsThe MiCBO-TF model represents a powerful platform for both mechanistic investigations and the development of precision medicine approaches for DMG.",1
"Hepatic sarcomatoid carcinoma (HSC) is characterized by its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. As of now, no universally endorsed standard therapeutic approaches for HSC have been established. Herein, we describe the case of a 60-year-old individual diagnosed with HSC, subsequently presenting with multiple metastases postoperatively. Owing to the pronounced expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), the individual was subjected to monotherapy utilizing sintilimab for a duration spanning 12 months. Following this regimen, a synergistic treatment approach comprising both anlotinib and sintilimab was instituted, culminating in an ensuing 11 months of efficacious therapeutic response. Throughout the course of treatment, the patient's quality of life remained satisfactory. This particular therapeutic strategy not merely reinforces the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in the realm of HSC management, but more pivotally, suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) might counteract resistance to PD-1 antagonists, thus offering a potentially augmented treatment paradigm for HSC.","Background and aimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and deadly disease with limited treatment options. Regorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promise in HCC treatment but faces limitations as a monotherapy. Combining regorafenib with PD-1 inhibitor may improve efficacy and survival outcomes for patients. This retrospective analysis was conducted to explore its efficacy and safety, providing reference experience for better application of this combination therapy.MethodsThis retrospective single-center study evaluated the efficacy and safety of combining regorafenib with PD-1 blockade for patients with HCC. Efficacy was evaluated according to the RECIST 1.1 evaluation criteria. Safety was assessed using CTCAE 4.0. Data was analyzed to compare survival status in different subgroups.ResultsGenerally, there were 76 patients with HCC elected to receive the regorafenib plus PD-1 blockade treatment during the study period. The objective response rate was 21.1% (n = 16), and the disease control rate was 56.6% (n = 43). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.8 months, and median overall survival had not yet been reached. All patients suffered of at least 1 adverse event. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 31.6% of patients (n = 24), with the most common being hand-foot syndrome, decreased appetite, and abdominal distension. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in PFS based on cirrhosis status or previous treatment lines.ConclusionWith manageable safety, regorafenib combined PD-1 inhibitor could bring survival benefits for advanced HCC who have received systemic treatment. Further, the Cox analysis showed that HBV infection, metastasis, etc. did not have significant effects on the survival benefits.",0
"AbstractThis review discusses terminology recently proposed for the classification of dementia and, more specifically, nosology related to aging-associated TDP-43 pathology: limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), and limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS). While the “gold standard” for these clinical conditions is still LATE neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC), clinical criteria and biomarkers are evolving. The newly proposed clinical rubrics are discussed with emphasis on the need for terminology that acknowledges the distinctions between clinical syndrome-, molecular biomarker-, and pathologically defined disease concepts. As further progress is made on research into the specific biomarker-based detection and prediction of TDP-43 proteinopathy in the clinical setting, the definitions of “Probable” and “Possible” LATE are likely to become more useful clinically. For people interested in the pathological diagnoses or basic research related to LATE-NC, the relevant terminology remains unchanged by the newly proposed clinical criteria.","BackgroundDespite advances in precision medicine for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), biomarker testing for these therapies remains frequently underused, delayed, and inequitable. Pulmonologists often play a critical role in the initial diagnostic steps for patients with lung cancer, and previous data show variability in their knowledge and practices regarding biomarker testing. The purpose of this study is to better understand how pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care.Research QuestionWith the increasing importance of biomarker testing and precision medicine, how do pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care?Study DesignAn electronic survey consisting of 31 items focused on attitudes and practices regarding diagnostic steps for NSCLC was randomly distributed to a sample of practicing pulmonologists in the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) analytics database. Inferential statistics were performed using χ2 tests and multivariable logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 401 pulmonologists responded to the survey. Most (92%) were general pulmonologists, and more than one-half (62%) indicated they order biomarker testing. Longer practice tenure, higher case volumes, and participation in a multidisciplinary tumor board were associated with ordering biomarkers (P < .05). Pulmonology was identified to have the leading responsibility for the initial diagnostic biopsy by most respondents (83%) and less often for staging (45%), leading discussions about biomarker testing with patients (28%), and for ordering biomarkers (22%). The most common reasons for not ordering biomarkers included the following: oncology was responsible (84%), it was not within their scope of practice (46%), or lack of the necessary knowledge (51%).InterpretationThis study shows that pulmonologists vary in their practices for ordering biomarkers, and many defer this responsibility to oncology. Despite the role of bronchoscopy and pulmonology societal guidelines for staging, many defer leadership of this process. Many pulmonologists lack the necessary resources and multidisciplinary infrastructure likely required to efficiently accomplish biomarker testing.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDImmunopeptide-based therapies offer the potential for cancer care breakthroughs, necessitating effective mass spectrometry utilization in preclinical research. Despite advancements in identifying cancer-specific antigens, personalized medicine faces challenges due to antigen scarcity, demanding heightened detection sensitivity. Additionally, limited patient tissue availability requires expanding antigen-presenting material through cell culture techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODSDisparate treatment responses are challenging for heterogeneous glioblastoma. Integrating next-gen sequencing and ex vivo patient stem-like cell (GSC) culture, our model mirrors disease heterogeneity and patient-specific responses to HSV1 oncolytic virus (OV) immunotherapy currently under clinical trials for glioblastoma patients. We developed a high-throughput assay using GSCs and immune cells to identify MHC I receptor-bound immunopeptides as response effectors utilizing 27 immune response markers-based flow cytometry. RESULTSGSCs (n=6), infected ex vivo with OV (after 12h at MOI=0.1), yielded EVs via ultracentrifugation. Global proteomic profiling mass spectrometry of EV detected 5,203 proteins, with TAP1, a pivotal player in loading viral peptide antigens onto MHC class I, as the most EV-enriched protein post-OV infection. MHC I was significantly enriched in EV, covering up to 0.1% of all EV proteins, allowing the detection of 2,276 MHC I-bound immunopeptides (out of a total of 45,963 peptides detected). Functional analysis of EVs’ immunological properties via ex vivo PBMC activation assays revealed OV-deregulated EV secretome, with upregulated proteins associated with immune response activation leading to increased activity of NK cells, DCs, NKTs, and CD8+ T cells subpopulations. The effect was diminished by MHC I antibody neutralization. CONCLUSIONSDesigned a high-throughput immune phenotype assay, employing a training cohort of GSCs and immune cells as donors and recipients, respectively, pinpointed MHC I receptor-bound immunopeptides and TAP1 overexpressed in response to OV infection as mechanistic effectors of the immune response. Methodological innovation of zooming on EV fraction instead of whole cell material allowed us to bypass the limitations of antigen and patient material scarcity by offering a higher MHC I presenting surface in the material devoid of bulky cellular protein complexes. EV-MHC immunoprecipitation proteomic approach thus correlates personalized clinical interventions with prognostic therapy-outcome assays, stratifying patients for new immunotherapeutic regimens.

However, the mechanistic relationships between IDO1 in amino acid depletion versus product generation have remained a long-standing mystery. We found an unrecognized link between IDO1 and cell survival mediated by KYN that serves as the source for molecules that inhibit ferroptotic cell death. We show this effect requires KYN export from IDO1-expressing cells, which is then available for non-IDO1-expressing cells via SLC7A11, the central transporter involved in ferroptosis suppression. Whether inside the “producer” IDO1+ cell or the “receiver” cell, KYN is converted into downstream metabolites, suppressing ferroptosis by ROS scavenging and activating an NRF2-dependent, AHR-independent cell protective pathway, including SLC7A11, propagating anti-ferroptotic signaling. IDO1 therefore controls a multi-pronged protection pathway from ferroptotic cell death, underscoring the need to re-evaluate the use of IDO1 inhibitors in cancer.",0
"Aim: To explore precise function and underlying mechanism of circ_0006988 in gastric cancer (GC).Materials & methods: GC tissues were collected clinically, and GC cells were purchased from the company. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression. Functional analysis was performed through CCK-8, Transwell and scratch experiment. Binding relationship was validated through dual luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. HGC-27 cells were subcutaneously injected into mice to construct a xenograft tumor model.Results: In GC tissues and cells, circ_0006988 overexpressed, promoting proliferation, migration and invasion. MiRNA-92a-2-5p downregulation or TFAP4 overexpression weakened effects of circ_0006988 silencing on GC progression.Conclusion: circ_0006988 facilitates GC development through miRNA-92a-2-5p/TFAP4 axis.","Background & Aims:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a heterogeneous and lethal malignancy, the molecular origins of which remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRs) target diverse signalling pathways, functioning as potent epigenetic regulators of transcriptional output. We aimed to characterise miRNome dysregulation in CCA, including its impact on transcriptome homeostasis and cell behaviour.Methods:Small RNA sequencing was performed on 119 resected CCAs, 63 surrounding liver (SL) tissues, and 22 normal (N) livers. High-throughput miR mimic screens were performed in 3 primary human cholangiocyte cultures. Integration of patient transcriptomes and miRseq together with miR screening data identified an oncogenic miR for characterization. MiR-mRNA interaction was investigated by luciferase assay. MiR-CRISPR knockout (KO) cells were generated and phenotypically characterized in vitro (proliferation, migration, colony, mitochondrial function, glycolysis) and in vivo by subcutaneous xenografts.Results:In total, 13% (140/1049) of detected miRs were differentially expressed between CCA and SL, including 135 upregulated in tumours. CCA tissues were characterised by higher miRNome heterogeneity and miR biogenesis pathway expression. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tumour miRNomes identified three subgroups, including dCCA-enriched and IDH1 mutant-enriched subgroups. High-throughput screening of miR mimics uncovered 71 miRs that consistently increased proliferation of 3 primary cholangiocyte models and were upregulated in CCA tissues regardless of anatomical location, among which only miR-27a-3p had consistently increased expression and activity in several cohorts. FoxO signalling was predominantly downregulated by miR-27a-3p in CCA, partially through targeting of FOXO1. MiR-27a KO increased FOXO1 levels in vitro and in vivo, impeding tumour behaviour and growth.Conclusions:The miRNomes of CCA tissues are highly remodelled, impacting transcriptome homeostasis in part through regulation of transcription factors like FOXO1. MiR-27a-3p arises as oncogenic vulnerability in CCA.",1
"Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies are emerging in the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as the dominant ablative approach as an alternative to surgery for primary breast cancer in patients who do not wish to have surgery or are poor surgical candidates. Cryoablation is well tolerated and provides excellent local control and cosmesis. Thermal ablation may also be used in the treatment of oligometastatic breast cancer, allowing patients to achieve long disease-free intervals. Transarterial therapies have been studied in the treatment of oligoprogressive hepatic metastasis, though further supportive data would be helpful to demonstrate its efficacy.","Background:There is a growing literature base regarding menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination among premenopausal people. However, relatively little is known about uterine bleeding in postmenopausal people following COVID-19 vaccination.Objectives:To examine trends in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses over time before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction and describe cases of new-onset postmenopausal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design:All analyses focused on members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest ages 45 and older who were diagnosed with incident postmenopausal bleeding in the electronic medical record. Members with pre-existing postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding, or who were at increased risk of bleeding due to other health conditions, were excluded. We used segmented regression analysis to estimate changes in the incidence of postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses from 2018 through 2021 in Kaiser Permanente Northwest members meeting inclusion criteria, stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status in 2021. Additionally, we identified all members with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccination between December 14, 2020, through August 14, 2021, who had an incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnosis within 60 days of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination, diagnostic procedures, and presumed bleeding etiology were assessed through chart review and described. A temporal scan statistic was run on all cases without clear bleeding etiology.Results:In a population of approximately 80,000 individuals per month there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction (p=0.59). Among 48,438 vaccinated individuals, 104 had postmenopausal bleeding first diagnosed within 60 days following COVID-19 vaccination; 76% of cases (79/104) were confirmed as post-vaccination postmenopausal bleeding after chart review. Median time from vaccination to bleeding onset was 21 days (range: 2–54 days). Among the 56 postmenopausal bleeding cases with a provider-attributed etiology, the common causes of bleeding were uterine or cervical lesions (50% [28/56]), hormone replacement therapy (13% [7/56]), and proliferative endometrium (13% [7/56]). Among the 23 cases without a clear etiology, there was no statistically significant clustering of postmenopausal bleeding onset following vaccination.Conclusions:Within this integrated health system, introduction of COVID-19 vaccines was not associated with an increase in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses. Diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding in the 60 days following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination was rare.",0
"A rich pipeline of therapeutic candidates is advancing for Parkinson’s disease, many of which are targeting the underlying pathophysiology of disease. Emerging evidence grounded in novel genetics and biomarker discoveries is illuminating the true promise of precision medicine-based therapeutic strategies for PD. There has been a growing effort to investigate disease-modifying therapies by designing clinical trials for genetic forms of PD - providing a clearer link to underlying pathophysiology. Leading candidate genes based on human genetic findings that are under active investigation in an array of basic and translational models include SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA. Broad investigations across mechanistic models show that these genes signal through common molecular pathways, namely, autosomal lysosomal pathways, inflammation and mitochondrial function. Therapeutic clinical trials to date based on genetically defined targets have not yet achieved approvals; however, much is to be learned from such pioneering trials. Fundamental principles of drug development that include proof of pharmacology in target tissue are critical to have confidence in advancing such precision-based therapies. There is a clear need for downstream biomarkers of leading candidate therapies to demonstrate proof of mechanism. The current regulatory landscape is poised and primed to support translational modeling strategies for the effective advancement of PD disease-modifying therapeutic candidates. A convergence of rich complex data that is available, the regulatory framework of model informed drug development (MIDD), and the new biological integrated staging frameworks when combined are collectively setting the stage for advancing new approaches in PD to accelerate progress. This perspective review highlights the potential of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling in contributing to the field and hastening the pace of progress in advancing collaborative approaches for urgently needed PD disease-modifying treatments.","AbstractThis review discusses terminology recently proposed for the classification of dementia and, more specifically, nosology related to aging-associated TDP-43 pathology: limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), and limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS).

"BackgroundCAR-T cell (chimeric antigen receptor T) therapy is now part of standard of care treatment of B‑cell lineage malignancies. Although it is an effective treatment, it comes along with adverse side effects and toxicities that may require intensive care therapy. The costs related to critical care therapy in critically ill patients after CAR‑T administration have not been evaluated.Patients and methodsRetrospective analysis of all patients who had received CAR‑T therapy and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care university medical centre in Germany between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2022. Cause of admission and ICU therapy as well as treatment and total hospitals costs were evaluated.ResultsThirty patients with a history of CAR-T cell therapy for underlying haematological malignancy were included. The median age of all patients was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 50–70) and 37% (n = 11) were female. 93% (n = 28) of patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 7% (n = 2) had multiple myeloma. The cohort was stratified whether the ICU admission was CAR‑T therapy related (that is within 30 days after CAR‑T therapy; 73%, n = 22) or the admission was of an other cause (> 30 days after CAR‑T therapy) (27%, n = 8). The median duration from CAR‑T therapy to ICU admission was 6 (range 5–8) days in CAR-T cell therapy associated ICU admissions compared with 52 (range 31–126) days in other admissions. The overall illness severity on admission was numerically higher in CAR-T-related ICU admission compared to other admissions (46 vs. 43 points, p = 0.18). Vasopressor therapy (50% vs. 75%; p = 0.19), invasive mechanical ventilation (27% vs. 50%; p = 0.24) and renal replacement therapy (14% vs. 50%; p < 0.05) were used in CAR-T-associated admission compared to other admissions, respectively. The ICU mortality (23% vs. 50%; p = 0.15) was higher in patients with other ICU admission. Median total costs of the entire inpatient stay in hospital were € 27,845 (range 8661–368,286 €) in CAR-T-associated ICU admissions compared to € 59,234 (range 23,182–127,044 €) in the group of other ICU admissions (costs of the CAR‑T product not included).ConclusionIn relation to the total costs of CAR-T-cell therapy (production of the CAR‑T product), therapy-associated complications have a relatively low impact on the costs and utilization of ICU resources.Supplementary InformationThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00063-024-01230-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","This Patent Highlight explores recent cancer treatment and monitoring advancements, focusing on selective KRAS inhibitors targeting mutations like G12C and G12D alongside germline epitope burden analysis.

"AbstractThe management of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) has transformed over the past 2 decades. Advances in surgical techniques, systemic therapies, and local treatments have resulted in a paradigm shift. Disease that would once have been considered terminal is now frequently treated aggressively with both a disease-free and overall survival benefit. In line with the expanding range of treatment options, there has been an increase in the volume and complexity of imaging required in the management of these patients to ensure optimal patient selection and outcome. The radiologist plays a pivotal role in interpreting these studies, conveying the relevant information and informing the discussion at multidisciplinary team meetings. The purpose of this review is to provide an update for radiologists on the current surgical management of patients with CRLM highlighting specific imaging information that is required by the multidisciplinary team when assessing resectability and/or the need for additional liver-directed therapies.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that has no therapeutic targets, relies on chemotherapeutics for treatment, and is in dire need of novel therapeutic approaches for improved patient outcomes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as intercellular communicators and have been proposed as ideal drug delivery vehicles. Here, EVs were engineered with RNA nanotechnology to develop TNBC tumor inhibitors. Using super resolved-structured illumination microscopy, EVs were optimized for precise Survivin small interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugated to chemotherapeutics loading and CD44 aptamer ligand decoration, thereby enhancing specificity toward TNBC cells. Conventional treatments typically employ chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine (GEM) and paclitaxel (PTX) at dosages on the order of mg/kg respectively, per injection (intravenous) in mice. In contrast, engineered EVs encapsulating these drugs saw functional tumor growth inhibition at significantly reduced concentrations: 2.2 μg/kg for GEM or 5.6 μg/kg for PTX, in combination with 21.5 μg/kg survivin-siRNA in mice. The result is a substantial decrease in the chemotherapeutic dose required, by orders of magnitude, compared with standard regimens. In vivo and in vitro evaluations in a TNBC orthotopic xenograft mouse model demonstrated the efficacy of this decreased dosage strategy, indicating the potential for decreased chemotherapy-associated toxicity.",0

Importantly, targeted CD274. degradation via baicaleininhibits tumor development by boosting T-cell-mediated antitumorimmunity. Thus, we elucidate a critical role of autophagy-lysosomalpathway in mediating CD274 degradation, and conceptually demonstratethat the design of a molecular “glue” that tethers the CD274-LC3interaction is an appealing strategy to develop CD274 inhibitors incancer therapy.Abbreviations: ATTECs: autophagy-tethering compounds; AUTACs: AUtophagy-TArgeting Chimeras; AUTOTACs: AUTOphagy-TArgeting Chimeras; AMPK: adenosine 5‘-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase; BiFC: bimolecular fluorescence complementation; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; CD274/PD-L1/B7-H1: CD274 molecule; CQ: chloroquine; CGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; DAPI: 4’6-diamino-2-phenylindole; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GZMB: granzyme B; IHC: immunohistochemistry; ICB: immune checkpoint blockade; KO: knockout; KD: equilibrium dissociation constant; LYTAC: LYsosome-TArgeting Chimera; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MST: microscale thermophoresis; NFAT: nuclear factor of activated T cells; NFKB/NF-kB: nuclear factor kappa B; NSCLC: non-small-cell lung cancer; PDCD1: programmed cell death 1; PROTACs: PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras; PRF1: perforin 1; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; PHA: phytohemagglutinin; PMA: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; SPR: surface plasmon resonance; TILs: tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte; TME: tumor microenvironment.","CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, plays an important role not only in the immune system but also in tumor progression. CD40 ligation reportedly promotes autophagy in immune cells. However, the effects of CD40 ligation on autophagy and its mechanism in solid tumor cells are still unclear. In this study, we find that CD40 ligation promotes autophagosome formation and consequently promotes autophagic flux in cervical cancer cells. Mechanistically, this effect relies on ERK contributing to CD40 ligation-induced ATG13 upregulation by p53. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CD40 ligation-induced autophagy increases the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer cells. Taken together, our results provide new evidence for the involvement of the CD40 pathway in autophagy and radiotherapy in cervical cancer cells.",1
"ABSTRACTModern molecular imaging routes, such as nuclear imaging and optical imaging, derive significant advantages from nanoparticles, where multimodality use and multipurpose are key benefits. Nanoparticles also showcase benefits over traditional imaging agents in nuclear and optical imaging, including improved resolution, penetration, and specificity. The goal of this literature review was to explore recent advancements in nanomaterials within these molecular imaging techniques to expand on the current state of nanomedicine in these modalities. This review derives findings from relevant reviews, original research papers, in-human clinical trials, and patents in the literature. Au- and Fe oxide-based nanosystems are just as ubiquitous within more modern modalities due to their multimodal diagnostic and therapeutic potential. It is also repeatedly highlighted in the literature, patents, and clinical trials that the use of nanoparticles, specifically in multimodal imaging techniques and theranostics, present innovative methods in recent years, enabling researchers and clinicians to overcome the limitations of unimodal imaging modalities and further advancing accuracy in the diagnosis and treatment of important pathologies, particularly cancer. Overall, nanoparticle-based imaging represents a transformative approach in advanced imaging modalities, offering new approaches to limitations of conventional agents currently being applied in clinical settings.","ObjectiveTo explore whether 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-derived parameters could predict biochemical response to abiraterone acetate (AA) treatment and prognosis in metastatic prostate cancer patients developing castration resistance after chemohormonal therapy at hormone-sensitive stage.MethodsThe clinicopathologic data of 106 mCRPC cases receiving AA treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors of biochemical response to AA treatment. Cox analyses were applied to investigate the independent prognostic factors for time to biochemical progression (TTBP) and radiological progression-free survival (rPFS). Survival analysis and ROC curve were also used.ResultsMultivariable Logistic analysis demonstrated that prior ADT duration ≥ 12 months, low prostate specific membrane antigen receptor-expressing tumor volume (PSMA-TV), low tumor to liver ratio (TLR) were independent predictors of biochemical response to AA treatment. Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that low PSMA-TV and low TLR were independent prognostic factors of longer TTBP and rPFS. The TTBP and rPFS of patients with higher PSMA-TV or TLR were significantly decreased compared with that of patients with lower PSMA-TV and TLR. The area under ROC curve (AUC) of combining ADT duration, PSMA-TV and TLR was 0.82 for predicting biochemical response to AA, which was significantly increased compared with that of other 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-derived parameters alone.ConclusionsLow PSMA-TV, low TLR were vital independent predictors of biochemical response to AA treatment and were associated with preferable prognosis in mCRPC patients. Combining ADT duration, PSMA-TV and TLR performed well in distinguishing AA responders from non-responders in mCRPC patients.",0
"The dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), which may result from genomic alterations or modulation by upstream effectors, is implicated in cancer oncogenesis and progression. CDK12 overexpression or activation is sufficient to induce tumor initiation, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance. However, CDK12 may also exert tumor-suppressive functions in a context-dependent manner. Therefore, caution is warranted when targeting CDK12 in future clinical trials. A comprehensive elucidation of the dual roles and underlying mechanisms of CDK12 in carcinogenesis is urgently needed to advance precision oncology. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the dysregulation and biological roles of CDK12 in cancer. Subsequently, we systematically summarize the functions and mechanisms of the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles of CDK12 in different contexts. Finally, we discuss the potential of CDK12 as a novel therapeutic target and its implications in clinical oncology, offering insights into future directions for innovative cancer treatment strategies.","BackgroundTrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells and many malignant tumor cells. However, data on TROP2 expression in advanced lung cancer are insufficient, and its changes have not been fully evaluated.MethodsWe assessed the prevalence and changes in TROP2 expression in patients with lung cancer who received anti-cancer treatments using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with an anti-TROP2 antibody (clone: SP295). IHC scores were graded from 0 to 3; grade ≥ 2 was considered positive for TROP2 expression. We defined a difference in IHC score, before and after anti-cancer treatments, as the change in TROP2 expression.ResultsBefore anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 89% (143/160) of the patients and was significantly more common in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma than in neuroendocrine carcinoma (P < 0.001). After anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 87% (139/160) of the patients. The distribution of TROP2 expression in post-treatment samples was analogous to that in pre-treatment samples when compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P = 0.509). However, an increase in TROP2 expression was seen in 19 (12%), and a decrease in 20 (13%) patients. Patients treated with targeted therapy showed significantly higher changes in TROP2 expression (P = 0.019) and thoracic radiotherapy was more likely to increase TROP2 expression than chemotherapy alone.ConclusionAlthough some anti-cancer treatments might alter the TROP2 expression, TROP2 was expressed in most lung cancer specimens before and after anti-cancer treatments. These results support the development of TROP2-directed therapy against advanced lung cancer in various treatment lines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03784-3.",1
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that has no therapeutic targets, relies on chemotherapeutics for treatment, and is in dire need of novel therapeutic approaches for improved patient outcomes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as intercellular communicators and have been proposed as ideal drug delivery vehicles. Here, EVs were engineered with RNA nanotechnology to develop TNBC tumor inhibitors. Using super resolved-structured illumination microscopy, EVs were optimized for precise Survivin small interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugated to chemotherapeutics loading and CD44 aptamer ligand decoration, thereby enhancing specificity toward TNBC cells. Conventional treatments typically employ chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine (GEM) and paclitaxel (PTX) at dosages on the order of mg/kg respectively, per injection (intravenous) in mice. In contrast, engineered EVs encapsulating these drugs saw functional tumor growth inhibition at significantly reduced concentrations: 2.2 μg/kg for GEM or 5.6 μg/kg for PTX, in combination with 21.5 μg/kg survivin-siRNA in mice. The result is a substantial decrease in the chemotherapeutic dose required, by orders of magnitude, compared with standard regimens. In vivo and in vitro evaluations in a TNBC orthotopic xenograft mouse model demonstrated the efficacy of this decreased dosage strategy, indicating the potential for decreased chemotherapy-associated toxicity.","BackgroundCopper homeostasis imbalance has been implicated in tumor progression, aggressiveness, and treatment response. However, the precise roles of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood.MethodsIn this study, we employed a consensus clustering algorithm to identify distinct molecular subtypes. We then performed Kaplan–Meier analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis to identify prognostic differentially expressed genes. The expression of these genes was subsequently validated using qPCR on fresh-frozen tissues obtained from HCC patients. Moreover, leveraging the TCGA-HCC cohort, we constructed a CRGs-related risk prediction model using the LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analysis.ResultsBy analyzing the data, we successfully established a CRGs risk prognostic model for HCC patients, comprising five differential genes (CAD, SGCB, TXNRD1, KDR, and MTND4P20). Cox regression analysis revealed that the CRGs risk score could serve as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.308, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.200 − 1.426, P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) values of the CRGs-score for predicting 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 0.785, 0.724, and 0.723, respectively. Notably, the expression levels of immune checkpoints (including PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4) significantly differed between the low- and high-risk score groups. Furthermore, the low-risk score group displayed increased sensitivity to sorafenib, cisplatin, cyclopamine, nilotinib, salubrinal, and gemcitabine, whereas the high-risk score group exhibited heightened sensitivity to lapatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the potential of the CRGs risk score as an independent and promising biomarker for clinical prognosis and immunotherapy sensitivity in HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05099-x.",0
"A rich pipeline of therapeutic candidates is advancing for Parkinson’s disease, many of which are targeting the underlying pathophysiology of disease. Emerging evidence grounded in novel genetics and biomarker discoveries is illuminating the true promise of precision medicine-based therapeutic strategies for PD. There has been a growing effort to investigate disease-modifying therapies by designing clinical trials for genetic forms of PD - providing a clearer link to underlying pathophysiology. Leading candidate genes based on human genetic findings that are under active investigation in an array of basic and translational models include SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA. Broad investigations across mechanistic models show that these genes signal through common molecular pathways, namely, autosomal lysosomal pathways, inflammation and mitochondrial function. Therapeutic clinical trials to date based on genetically defined targets have not yet achieved approvals; however, much is to be learned from such pioneering trials. Fundamental principles of drug development that include proof of pharmacology in target tissue are critical to have confidence in advancing such precision-based therapies. There is a clear need for downstream biomarkers of leading candidate therapies to demonstrate proof of mechanism. The current regulatory landscape is poised and primed to support translational modeling strategies for the effective advancement of PD disease-modifying therapeutic candidates. A convergence of rich complex data that is available, the regulatory framework of model informed drug development (MIDD), and the new biological integrated staging frameworks when combined are collectively setting the stage for advancing new approaches in PD to accelerate progress. This perspective review highlights the potential of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling in contributing to the field and hastening the pace of progress in advancing collaborative approaches for urgently needed PD disease-modifying treatments.","T cell malignancies represent a diverse collection of leukemia/lymphoma conditions in humans arising from aberrant T cells. Such malignancies are often associated with poor clinical prognoses, cancer relapse, as well as progressive resistance to anti-cancer treatments. While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy has emerged as a revolutionary treatment strategy that is highly effective for treating B cell malignancies, its application as a treatment for T cell malignancies remains to be better explored. Furthermore, the effectiveness of CAR-T treatment in T cell malignancies is significantly influenced by the quality of contamination-free CAR-T cells during the manufacturing process, as well as by multiple characteristics of such malignancies, including the sharing of antigens across normal and malignant T cells, fratricide, and T cell aplasia. In this review, we provide a detailed account of the current developments in the clinical application of CAR-T therapy to treat T cell malignancies, offer strategies for addressing current challenges, and outline a roadmap toward its effective implementation as a broad treatment option for this condition.",0
"Purpose Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. To improve the therapeutic outcomes, drug delivery systems, and particularly liposomes, have been widely investigated. Therefore, this review analyzed systematically the literature to inquire about the safety and efficacy of liposomal formulations in lung cancer treatment.MethodsThree electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL) were systematically searched until May 2020. Clinical trials containing information about the effects of liposomal formulations in lung cancer patients were considered eligible.ResultsTwenty two selected studies present different treatment options for both small and non-small-cell lung cancers. After compiling and analyzing all the published information, we verified that combination of liposomal cisplatin and paclitaxel led to a statistically significant improvement of the evaluated outcomes. Moreover, tecemotide, a liposome-based immunotherapy, demonstrated lower toxicity compared to control groups. Evidences that other subgroups could benefit from this formulation were also provided.ConclusionThis systematic review (registration number CRD42021246587) demonstrates that liposomal formulations are promising alternatives to overcome limitations of traditional cancer therapy. However, larger, longer, randomized and double-blinded clinical trials, selecting their patients’ cohort considering more responsive subgroups would be beneficial to strengthen the scientific and clinical evidence of the results herein reported.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04079-x.","BackgroundThis study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MethodsElectronic databases were scanned to identify relevant trials. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and their prognostic factors. Stratified analyses were accomplished on ICIs agent and evaluation criteria.ResultsTotally, 3697 individuals from 40 cohorts were recruited. For patients treated with ICIs, the pooled median time to progression (TTP) was 8.0 months, median PFS 4.9 months, and median OS 12.0 months; the pooled median PFS and OS of ICIs plus anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents (PFS: 6.3 months, OS: 16.4 months) were longer than those of ICIs alone. Furthermore, Child–Pugh stage (HR = 1.37, P = 0.0123) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (HR = 1.40, P = 0.0016) were prognostic factors for PFS. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0356), Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR = 1.17, P < 0.0001), Child–Pugh stage (HR = 1.58, P < 0.0001), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (HR = 1.23, P = 0.0005), ECOG (HR = 1.50, P = 0.0012), portal vein invasion (HR = 1.32, P = 0.0053), extrahepatic metastasis (HR = 0.84, P = 0.0047), best response (HR = 0.58, P < 0.0001), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (HR = 1.23, P = 0.0451) were the prognostic factors for OS. According to both RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) rate of ICIs plus anti-VEGF agents were better than those of ICIs alone. The overall rate of any grade adverse events (AEs) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.61–0.89), grade 3 or higher AEs was 0.28 (95% CI 0.15–0.42), and the rate of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 0.09 (95% CI 0.06–0.12).ConclusionsThe ICIs was promising in HCC with good efficacy and tolerated toxicity. Compared with ICIs monotherapy, the joint application of ICIs and anti-VEGF agents can contribute a lot more benefits to the survival of patients according to clinical practices.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03716-1.",1
"PurposeThere is not much progress in the treatment for lung squamous cell carcinoma LSCC in the past few years. Rapamycin Rapa, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR, has exhibited antitumor efficacy in a variety of malignant tumors. It has recently been reported that Rapamycin can induce autophagy signaling pathway in lung cancer and Glypican-3GPC3 can promote the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by stimulating canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of rapamycin’s antitumor efficacy in relation to GPC3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy in LSCC.MethodsSK-MES-1 cells, a LSCC cell line, were treated with various concentrations of rapamycin with or without Glypican-3 GPC3-targeting siRNA. SK-MES-1 cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Protein expression levels of GPC3, β-catenin, Beclin-1 were checked via western blotting. We established the xenograft mice model to investigate the suppression effect of rapamycin on LSCC. In addition, we further testified the metabolism protein of autophagy process using the xenograft tumor tissue. ResultsRapamycin could inhibit the SK-MES-1 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the GPC3 expression and downregulating the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we found that GPC3 silencing can activate the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy, which contribute to the suppression of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionRapamycin suppresses the growth of lung cancer through down-regulating glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which mediates with activation of autophagy. This study suggests GPC3 is a new promising target for rapamycin in the treatment of lung cancer.","Purpose Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.

"AbstractBackgroundAcral melanoma, characterized by its aggressiveness and poor prognosis compared to other melanoma subtypes, poses significant challenges in clinical management. However, the molecular underpinnings driving the biological and clinical features of this disease remain poorly understood.ObjectivesIn this study, our aim was to elucidate the molecular landscape and the correlation between subtypes and clinical features of acral melanoma.MethodsWe conducted comprehensive analyses to dissect the molecular characteristics of acral melanoma, employing a combination of multi‐omics data analysis and network‐based disease gene prediction algorithms. Single‐cell RNA‐Seq data were utilized to investigate the contribution of immunocytes to the molecular classification of acral melanoma. Additionally, we used clinical samples to validate the correlation between new subtypes and the prognosis of acral melanoma and the expression of subtype markers and verified the interaction between macrophages and acral melanoma cells at cellular level.ResultsOur study reveals the existence of two distinct subtypes of acral melanoma exhibiting marked differences in clinical behaviour, cellular and molecular mechanisms. We identified a robust biomarker panel (EREG, VSIG4, FCGR3A and RAB20) that accurately distinguishes these two subtypes with an impressive AUC of 0.946, validated using clinical samples. Subtype I, characterized by thinner Breslow thickness, demonstrates a favourable prognosis, whereas Subtype II represents a high‐risk subtype with a propensity for dermal invasion. Notably, the signature gene EREG of Subtype I is enriched in FCN1+ macrophages, known for promoting inflammatory and immune responses. Conversely, signature genes VSIG4 and FCGR3A of Subtype II are enriched in SPP1+ macrophages, which exhibit significant crosstalk with tumour cells.ConclusionsOur findings significantly enhance the understanding of the molecular landscape of acral melanoma and offer novel insights into its clinical management by identifying distinct subtypes and potential therapeutic targets. The findings have to be confirmed in different cohorts in the future for full validation.","PurposeEpidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR–TKIs) are the first-line therapy for patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) harboring activating EGFR mutations. However, the emergence of drug resistance to EGFR–TKIs remains a critical obstacle for successful treatment and is associated with poor patient outcomes. The overarching objective of this study is to apply bioinformatics tools to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying resistance to EGFR–TKIs and develop a robust predictive model.MethodsThe genes associated with gefitinib resistance in the LUAD cell Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were identified using gene chip expression data. Functional enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration analysis were performed to comprehensively explore the mechanism of gefitinib resistance. Furthermore, a GRRG_score was constructed by integrating genes related to LUAD prognosis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database with the screened Gefitinib Resistant Related differentially expressed genes (GRRDEGs) using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) features and their association with immune infiltration between different GRRG_score groups. A prognostic model for LUAD was developed based on the GRRG_score and validated. The HPA database was used to validate protein expression. The CTR-DB database was utilized to validate the results of drug therapy prediction based on the relevant genes.ResultsA total of 110 differentially expression genes were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in Mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, Sphingolipid metabolism. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that biological processes strongly correlated with gefitinib resistance were cell proliferation and immune-related pathways, EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION, APICAL_SURFACE, and APICAL_JUNCTION were highly expressed in the drug-resistant group; KRAS_SIGNALING_DN, HYPOXIA, and HEDGEHOG_SIGNALING were highly expressed in the drug-resistant group. The GRRG_score was constructed based on the expression levels of 13 genes, including HSPA2, ATP8B3, SPOCK1, EIF6, NUP62CL, BCAR3, PCSK9, NT5E, FLNC, KRT8, FSCN1, ANGPTL4, and ID1. We further screened and validated two key genes, namely, NUP62CL and KRT8, which exhibited predictive value for both prognosis and drug resistance.ConclusionsOur study identified several novel GRRDEGs and provided insight into the underlying mechanisms of gefitinib resistance in LUAD. Our results have implications for developing more effective treatment strategies and prognostic models for LUAD patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05129-8.",0
"AbstractBackground:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subsequent radiotherapy (RT) following first-line treatment with durvalumab plus chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).Methods:A total of 122 patients with ES-SCLC from three hospitals during July 2019 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was performed to address potential confounding factors. The primary focus of our evaluation was to assess the impact of RT on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:After IPTW analysis, 49 patients received durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide (EP) chemotherapy followed by RT (Durva + EP + RT) and 72 patients received immunochemotherapy (Durva + EP). The median OS was 17.2 months vs. 12.3 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17–0.85, P = 0.020), and the median PFS was 8.9 months vs. 5.9 months (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32–0.97, P = 0.030) in Durva + EP + RT and Durva + EP groups, respectively. Thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) resulted in longer OS (17.2 months vs. 14.7 months) and PFS (9.1 months vs. 7.2 months) compared to RT directed to other metastatic sites. Among patients with oligo-metastasis, RT also showed significant benefits, with a median OS of 17.4 months vs. 13.7 months and median PFS of 9.8 months vs. 5.9 months compared to no RT. Continuous durvalumab treatment beyond progression (TBP) prolonged OS compared to patients without TBP, in both the Durva + EP + RT (NA vs. 15.8 months, HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.14–1.63, P = 0.238) and Durva + EP groups (12.3 months vs. 4.3 months, HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10–0.81, P = 0.018). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 13 (26.5%) and 13 (18.1%) patients, respectively, in the two groups; pneumonitis was mostly low-grade.Conclusion:Addition of RT after first-line immunochemotherapy significantly improved survival outcomes with manageable toxicity in ES-SCLC.","AbstractIntroductionDurvalumab plus tremelimumab combination therapy (STRIDE regimen) is a new first-line option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), but little real-world data are available to determine which patients are most likely to respond.MethodsThis study retrospectively evaluated patients with uHCC who were treated with the STRIDE regimen as the 1st line at our hospital. The primary endpoint of the study was the objective response rate (ORR). We focused on identifying factors associated with cases that had a favorable response.ResultsTwenty-one patients were included. In best response, there were 11 partial response cases, with an ORR of 52.4%. Median progression-free survival was 6.8 months, and overall survival did not reach the median time. A high tumor-to-liver ratio of the maximum value of the standardized uptake value (TLR) on baseline fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was associated with response, while TLRs were significantly higher in poorly differentiated uHCC.ConclusionThe STRIDE regimen may be beneficial for systemic therapy-naive uHCC patients. High TLR on baseline FDG-PET could be a potentially useful biomarker for response.",1
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive and non-ionizing sonic energy-based therapeutic technology for inducing thermal and non-thermal effects in tissues. Depending on the parameters, HIFU can ablate tissues by heating them to >55 °C to induce denaturation and coagulative necrosis, improve radio- and chemo-sensitizations and local drug delivery from nanoparticles at moderate hyperthermia (∼41–43 °C), and mechanically fragment cells using acoustic cavitation (also known as histotripsy). HIFU has already emerged as an attractive modality for treating human & veterinary cancers, infectious diseases, and neuromodulation. Herein, we comprehensively review the role of HIFU in enhancing drug delivery and immunomodulation in soft and calcified tissues. Specifically, the ability of HIFU to improve adjuvant treatments from various classes of therapeutic agents are described. These crucial insights highlight the opportunities and challenges of HIFU technology and its potential to support new clinical trials and translation to patients.","Purpose Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.

"With expansion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and broader utilization of anti-cytokine directed therapeutics for toxicity mitigation, the routine assessment of cytokines may enhance understanding of toxicity profiles, guide therapeutic interventions, and facilitate cross-trial comparisons. As specific cytokine elevations can correlate with and provide insights into CAR T cell toxicity, mitigation strategies, and response, we explored the reporting of cytokine detection methods and assessed for the correlation of cytokines to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) across clinical trials. In this analysis, we reviewed 21 clinical trials across 60 manuscripts that featured a US Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR T cell construct or one of its predecessors. We highlight substantial variability and limited reporting of cytokine measurement platforms and panels used across CAR T cell clinical trials. Specifically, across 60 publications, 28 (46.7%) did not report any cytokine data, representing 6 of 21 (28.6%) clinical trials. In the 15 trials reporting cytokine data, at least 4 different platforms were used. Furthermore, correlation of cytokines with ICANS, CRS, and CRS severity was limited. Considering the fundamental role of cytokines in CAR T cell toxicity, our manuscript supports the need to establish standardization of cytokine measurements as a key biomarker essential to improving outcomes of CAR T cell therapy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Pathologically, this disease is associated with the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuroinflammation. Current drug treatments primarily focus on managing symptoms rather than stopping disease progression. Disease-modifying therapies target the clearance of amyloid plaques through active and passive immunity methods. Although successful in animal models, human trials have shown adverse effects, such as meningoencephalitis, in a small number of patients who received active immunity methods. The efficacy of active immunity methods in treating AD remains uncertain, but passive immunity methods amyloid-beta (Abeta)-specific monoclonal antibody therapies such as aducanumab and lecanemab have been approved by the FDA. Despite the limitations of immune-based therapies, T-cell, and chimeric antigen receptor-based treatments show promise, but new guidelines are necessary to address potential adverse events.

"AbstractBACKGROUNDBeing the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults, glioblastoma (GBM) is, simultaneously, the best-studied central nervous system neoplasm with the continuous development of new treatments, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy, to improve outcomes for GBM patients. However, even with such a big effort, GBMs are still challenging to manage, with poor prognosis. Recurrence is certain, and the average survival time is relatively short. In the search for effective therapies, the focus switches now to existing drugs with the aim of repurposing. One of the possible candidates is the first-line drug for type 2 diabetes - metformin (MTF). It acts mainly through decreasing liver glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity. However, the exact mechanism of MTF’s action is not fully understood. Its positive influence is observed in many aspects of cardiovascular disease, gut microbiota modulation, hormonal balance, cancer prevention and treatment, as well as longevity and aging. These multiple effects highlight the potential of MTF as a versatile medication beyond its traditional use in diabetes. They also drive attention to possible underlying molecular processes responsible for such a broad action. The only phenomenon that can explain such a complex influence on diverse biological processes is epigenetics. One of the main epigenetic processes is DNA methylation, which directly influences gene expression. 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in DNA is the best-characterized epigenetic mark. Our project aimed to evaluate the total DNA methylation level after MTF administration on the GBM cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODSUsing the nucleotide post-labeling method, we analyzed the total amount of m5C in DNA of GBM (T98G, U138), and normal (HaCaT) cell lines treated with MTF. RESULTSNo significant changes in total DNA methylation were observed in non-cancer cell lines (HaCaT) treated with MTF, due to small toxicity confirmed also with global DNA guanosine oxidation (8-oxo-dG). On the opposite, DNA hypomethylation was observed for GBM cell lines (T98G and U138) with increasing MTF concentration and incubation time. We also analyzed the combined effects of MTF with temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line chemotherapeutic for GBM. MTF potentiated the demethylating effect of TMZ. The concomitant application of both drugs induced DNA oxidation. CONCLUSIONTotal DNA methylation changes in GBM cell lines under MTF treatment suggest the new mechanism of that drug action and promote clinical implications for adjusting MTF and TMZ therapy in GBM patients. Our results show the potential and possible obstacles of the combined therapy of TMZ with MTF. Combined therapy with both drugs leads to total DNA hypomethylation. Therefore it is necessary to adjust MTF administration during TMZ therapy.

It primarily addresses the duties of the physician in relation to an individual physician–patient relationship and implicitly advocates a ‘first come, first served’ model. It assumes the availability of adequate resources to treat all patients. However, no health system can meet all the requirements of its intended beneficiaries, and resource allocation, priority-setting and triaging are inevitable. Yet the Declaration of Geneva ‘does not permit considerations of age, disease or disability, gender …, social standing or any other factor’ to be considered. Neither does it permit consideration of ‘financial toxicity of treatment’ on patients, families and struggling healthcare systems. Making resource allocation, priority-setting, and triaging decisions is ethically complex. Yet in many resource-limited settings, such difficult and ethical judgement calls are left to individual physicians to make; this applies especially in low- and middle-income countries where practitioners are often faced with overwhelming burdens of disease and simply cannot treat everyone requiring care. The Declaration of Geneva should be amended to recognise limitations of physicians to deliver care because of health system constraints and should speak not only of a physician’s duty towards the individual patient but also to broader society. It should provide ethical guidance to those practising in limited resource settings about triaging, protecting elective care, ensuring training of well-rounded physicians, ensuring financial wellness of patients and healthcare systems and ensuring accountability for health and wellness of patients and healthcare systems.",0
"PurposeThis phase I clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell generated by the piggyBac transposon system in advanced relapsed/refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Compared to viral systems, the piggyBac transposon system is a simpler, more economical, and alternative way to introduce chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgenes into T cells.MethodsThis study recruited nine patients with advanced relapsed/refractory EGFR-positive NSCLC for two cycles of the piggyBac-generated EGFR-CAR T cells at dose of 1 × 106 cells/kg or 3 × 106 cells/kg of body weight. The patients were monitored for adverse events, clinical response, and persistence of plasma GFR-CAR T cells.ResultsInfusions of piggyBac-generated EGFR-CAR T cells were well tolerated in all nine patients. The most common adverse events were grade 1 to 3 fever and there were no patients who experienced grade 4 adverse events or serious cytokine release syndrome. After treatment, eight of nine patients showed detectable EGFR-CAR T cells in their peripheral blood. One patient showed a partial response and lasted for more than 13 months, while six had stable disease, and two had progressed disease. The progression-free survival of these nine patients was 7.13 months (95% CI 2.71–17.10 months), while the median overall survival was 15.63 months (95% CI 8.82–22.03 months).ConclusionThis Phase I clinical trial revealed that the non-viral piggyBac transposon system-engineered EGFR-CAR T-cell therapy is feasible and safe in treatment of EGFR-positive advanced relapsed/refractory NSCLC patients. Future study will assess it in more patients or even possibly with a higher dose.Trial registration number NCT03182816.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03613-7.","BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promising results in treating blood cancers, but it has limited efficacy against solid tumors that express mesothelin (MSLN). One of the reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which consists of physical barriers, multiple mechanisms of immune evasion, and various biochemical factors that favor tumor growth and survival. These factors reduce the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells in clinical trials. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to enhance the effectiveness of MSLN-targeted CAR T cell therapy.MethodsTo investigate whether the antitumor efficacy of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells depends on the epitopes they recognize, we generated MSLN-targeted CAR T cells that bind to different regions of MSLN (Region I, II, III and Full length). We then evaluated the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan or an anti-PD-1 antibody in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe found that MSLN-targeted CAR T cells effectively killed MSLN-positive cancer cells (H9, H226 and Panc-1), but not MSLN-negative cells (A431) in vitro. In a mouse model of H9 tumor xenografts, all CAR T cells showed similar tumor suppression, but an MSLN-targeted scFv with Region I epitope, R47, performed slightly better. Combining irinotecan with CAR_R47 T cells enhanced tumor control synergistically in both H9 xenograft mice and patient-derived xenograft mice.ConclusionsOur results suggest that irinotecan can enhance the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells, and offer a promising combination therapy strategy for MSLN-positive solid tumors.",1
"Innate immunity, cell death and inflammation underpin many aspects of health and disease. Upon sensing pathogens, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or alarmins, the innate immune system activates inflammatory cell death, such as pyroptosis and PANoptosis. These genetically-defined, regulated cell death pathways not only contribute to the host defense against infectious disease, but also promote pathological manifestations leading to cancer and inflammatory diseases. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms has grown rapidly in recent years. However, how dying cells, cell corpses, and their liberated cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory signalling molecules are further sensed by innate immune cells, and their contribution to further amplify inflammation, trigger antigen presentation, and activate adaptive immunity, is less clear. Here, we discuss how pattern-recognition and PANoptosome sensors in innate immune cells recognize and respond to cell-death signatures. We also highlight molecular targets of the innate immune response for potential therapeutic development.","PurposesIncreased number of studies reveal the crucial role of the Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway in anti-tumor immunity. In this study, we aim to explore the effect of cGAS/STING on tumor immune microenvironment of melanoma after carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and the underlying mechanism.MethodsC57BL/6 mouse tumor models were used to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments (X-ray, carbon ion, PD-L1 inhibitor and combination therapies) on tumor growth and process. Mass cytometry was performed to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). DNA damage response (DDR) and cGAS/STING pathway were investigated by immunofluorescence-co-localization assays, γ-H2AX, P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), Breast Cancer 1 (BRCA1), and cGAS measurements.ResultsCarbon ion irradiation caused more DNA damages and cGAS–STING pathway activation compared with X-ray irradiation, and the former slowed the melanoma growth in syngeneic model. Although X-ray irradiation is not sensitive for melanoma treatment, carbon ion irradiation showed a significant anti-tumor effect for melanoma treatment. TILs analysis revealed that CIRT boosted the infiltration of natural killer (NK), CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, meanwhile increased the number of immune checkpoint (programmed death-1, PD-1, lymphocyte activation gene 3, LAG-3 and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3, TIM-3). Moreover, CIRT increased PD-L1 exposure on cell surface compared with X-ray group. Furthermore, CIRT combined with PD-L1 inhibitor therapy increased the number of T cells and NK cells in melanoma, and slowed the growth of melanoma compared with other therapies.ConclusionsOur findings showed that CIRT displayed biological effects by increasing DNA damages of tumor cells and improving immunity in melanoma, which indicated that CIRT might be a potential synergetic treatment for radiotherapy and radioimmunotherapy in melanoma patients. Our works put forward a new insight to provide an effective strategy for melanoma therapy. These findings may help in the design of strategies on melanoma in clinical studies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04577-6.",1
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent form of gastrointestinal malignancy with challenges in chemotherapy resistance and side effects. Effective and low toxic drugs for CRC treatment are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death, which has garnered attention for its therapeutic potential against cancer. Baicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is the primary flavone extracted from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis that exhibits anticancer effects against several malignancies including CRC. In this study, we investigated whether baicalein induced ferroptosis in CRC cells. We showed that baicalein (1–64 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of human CRC lines HCT116 and DLD1. Co-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (1 μM) significantly mitigated baicalein-induced CRC cell death, whereas autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (25 μM), necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (10 μM), or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (10 μM) did not rescue baicalein-induced CRC cell death. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the inhibitory effect of baicalein on CRC cells is associated with ferroptosis induction. We revealed that baicalein (7.5–30 μM) dose-dependently decreased the expression levels of GPX4, key regulator of ferroptosis, in HCT116 and DLD1 cells by blocking janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway via direct interaction with JAK2, ultimately leading to ferroptosis in CRC cells. In a CRC xenograft mouse model, administration of baicalein (10, 20 mg/kg, i.g., every two days for two weeks) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth with significant ferroptosis induced by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 axis in tumor tissue. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis contributes to baicalein-induced anti-CRC activity through blockade of the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 signaling pathway, which provides evidence for the therapeutic application of baicalein against CRC.","Aim: This study investigated the role of lncRNA LINC01232 in ferroptosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials & methods: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blot experiments were performed to examine relevant mRNAs and proteins expression. The kit assays evaluated malondialdehyde, iron, Fe2+ and glutathione levels. ROS levels were verified by flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation analysis monitored the correlation among LINC01232, H3K27ac, p300 and ARNTL2.Results: LINC01232 or ARNTL2 knockdown facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis. The interaction between LINC01232 and p300 resulted in the enhancement of H3K27ac levels at ARNTL2 promoter to promote ARNTL2 transcriptional activity. ARNTL2 overexpression reversed the promoting effect of LINC01232 knockdown on ferroptosis.Conclusion: LINC01232 inhibited the ferroptosis in CRC by epigenetically upregulating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL2.",1
"IntroductionThe most common malignant neoplasm of the oral cavity is squamous cell carcinoma. It accounts for over 95% of malignant lesions in this area and is characterised by rapid spread and distant metastases.AimTo collect and review the data on B7 family proteins as prognostic factors in oral squamous cell carcinoma and to describe their role in aggressive disease progression.MethodsA systematic review of the literature about B7-1, B7-2, B7-H2, B7-H3, B7-H4, B7-H5 (VISTA), B7-H6 and B7-H7, was carried out, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 9 articles published before 22 May 2020 were included in the systematic review.ResultsThe biggest study group consisted of 201 patients and the smallest – 40 patients. B7-1, B7-H3, B7-H4, B7-H5, B7-H6 and B7-H7 protein expressions were prognostic factors. Overall survival was significantly associated with B7-H3, B7-H5, B7-H6 and B7-H7. Immunohistochemistry was the diagnostic method used in all the studies.ConclusionsThe data presented indicate the complexity of cellular and molecular processes related to the formation, development and invasion of oral cancer. Mutations in genes encoding the B7 family and changes in the B7 protein pathway may affect the prognosis of survival in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.","AbstractBackgroundPrevious results of our trial demonstrated that the addition of induction chemotherapy (IC) prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) failed to significantly improve the response rate or 3-year survival in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here, we report long-term results and exploratory analyses to further evaluate the therapeutic value of IC.MethodsPatients with previously untreated, unresectable, stage II-IVA ESCC were randomly assigned to receive IC followed by CRT or CRT alone. The relationship between tumor response to IC and long-term survival was analyzed. Baseline tumor biopsies were collected for RNA-Seq to identify patients who may benefit from IC.ResultsEligible patients were randomized to either the IC + CRT group (n = 55) or the CRT group (n = 55). With a median follow-up of 74.9 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 31.8% in the IC + CRT group and 29.1% in the CRT group (P =.675; HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.58-1.43). Similarly, no significant differences were identified in 5-year progression-free survival between groups (30.5% vs 25.5%, P =.508; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.56-1.34). Patients who responded to IC had significantly better survival than nonresponders. A risk-score model incorporating 6 key genes to predict IC efficacy was also constructed.ConclusionsCompared with definitive CRT alone, the addition of IC before CRT still failed to demonstrate superior survival in patients with unselected ESCC, based on long-term follow-up. However, because IC responders were associated with more favorable survival, potential molecular biomarkers were identified for selection of benefit population from IC.Clinical Trials RegistrationNCT02403531.",0
"Introduction of fluorine into bioactive molecules has attracted much attention in drug development. For example, tetrafluorination of the phthalimide moiety of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) has a strong beneficial effect on the ability to inhibit angiogenesis. The neomorphic activity of E3 ligase complexes is induced by the binding of IMiDs to cereblon. We investigated that a set of eight thalidomide analogs, comprising non- and tetrafluorinated counterparts, did not induce the degradation of neomorphic substrates (IKZF3, GSPT1, CK1α, SALL4). Hence, the antiangiogenic activity of fluorinated IMiDs was not triggered by neosubstrate degradation features. A fluorine scanning of non-traditional IMiDs of the benzamido glutarimide chemotype was performed. By measuring the endothelial cell tube formation, no angiogenesis inhibitors were identified, confirming the narrow structure–activity window of IMiD-induced antiangiogenesis.","Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment that kills cancer cells selectively by stimulating reactive oxygen species generation with photosensitizers exposed to specific light wavelengths. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a widely used photosensitizer. However, its limited tumour penetration and targeting reduce its therapeutic efficacy. Scholars have investigated nano-delivery techniques to improve 5-ALA administration and efficacy in PDT. This review summarises recent advances in biological host biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms for 5-ALA production. The review also highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of various 5-ALA nano-delivery modalities, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and gels, in treating various cancers. Although promising, 5-ALA nano-delivery methods face challenges that could impair targeting and efficacy. To determine their safety and biocompatibility, extensive preclinical and clinical studies are required. This study highlights the potential of 5-ALA-NDSs to improve PDT for cancer treatment, as well as the need for additional research to overcome barriers and improve medical outcomes.Graphical abstract",1
"ABSTRACTHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer-related death with limited therapies, is a complex disease developing in a background of Hepatitis Virus infection or systemic conditions, such as the metabolic syndrome. Investigating HCC pathogenesis in model organisms is therefore crucial for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been instrumental in recapitulating the local and systemic features of HCC. Early studies using GEMMs and patient material implicated members of the dimeric Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, such as c-Jun and c-Fos, in HCC formation. In a recent report, we described how switchable, hepatocyte-restricted expression of a single-chain c-Jun~Fra-2 protein, functionally mimicking the c-Jun/Fra-2 AP-1 dimer, results in spontaneous and largely reversible liver tumors in GEMMs. Dysregulated cell cycle, inflammation, and dyslipidemia are observed at early stages and tumors display molecular HCC signatures. We demonstrate that increased c-Myc expression is an essential molecular determinant of tumor formation that can be therapeutically targeted using the BET inhibitor JQ1. Here, we discuss these findings with additional results illustrating how AP-1 GEMMs can foster preclinical research on liver diseases with novel perspectives offered by the constantly increasing wealth of HCC-related datasets.","Mouse models remain at the forefront of immuno-oncology research, providing invaluable insights into the complex interactions between the immune system and developing tumors. While several flow cytometry panels have been developed to study the immunity to cancer in mice, most of them present limitations in their capacity to address the complexity of anti-cancer immune responses. For example, many of the panels developed to date focus on a restricted number of leukocyte populations (notably, T cells or antigen-presenting cells), failing to include the multitude of other subsets that participate in anti-cancer immunity. In addition, these panels were developed using blood or splenic leukocytes. While the immune composition of the blood or spleen can provide information on systemic immune responses to cancer, it is in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that local immunity takes place. Therefore, we optimized this spectral flow cytometry panel for identifying the chief cell types that take part in immunity to cancer using immune cells from cancer tissue. We used pancreatic tumors implanted both orthotopically and subcutaneously to demonstrate the panel’s flexibility and suitability in diverse mouse models. The panel was also validated in peripheral immune districts (namely, the blood, spleen, and liver of tumor-harboring mice) to allow comparisons between local and systemic anti-tumor immunity.Basic Protocol 1: Tumor induction – OrthotopicAlternate Protocol 1: Tumor induction – SubcutaneousBasic Protocol 2: Preparation of single cell suspensions from the tumor, spleen, liver, and blood of tumor-bearing miceAlternate Protocol 2: Staining single cell suspensions from the tumor, spleen, liver, and blood of tumor-bearing mice",1
"A small number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) either present with or progress to the accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP). This occurs in approximately 4–7% of patients with CML. Most patients who progress to BP-CML are of myeloid lineage, while approximately 30% are of lymphoid lineage. Due to the rarity of this condition, there are no large or randomized trials that can inform clinical decisions. Most data are from retrospective chart reviews or data from old studies when tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were initially approved. In addition, the definition of these categories has been in continuous flux over the last 20 years, making applicability of data even more confusing. In some classifications, the cutoff is 30% blasts for the definition of BP-CML, while in others a cutoff of 20% is used. In addition, more recently the World Health Organization (WHO) classification omitted the accelerated phase and recognized only a two-phase disease, while the International Consensus Classification retained a three-phase definition and retained the accelerated phase. Therapy for patients with AP/BP-CML depends on several factors, including prior therapy, BCR::ABL1 mutation, co-morbidities, cell lineage, and eligibility for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT). Patients with AP-CML at presentation have a relatively favorable prognosis and may not need alloHCT if they respond appropriately to therapy. For patients with AP-CML who progressed while on TKI therapy or those with BP-CML, alloHCT is considered the only curative therapy. Our goal is to review the available data on the therapy of patients with AP-CML and BP-CML.","AbstractWith substantial effects on human health, air pollution has become a major global concern.

"Metabolic adaptation serves as a significant driving force for cancer growth and poses a substantial obstacle for cancer therapies. Herein, we unraveled the role of m6A-mediated serine synthesis pathway (SSP) regulation in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrated that treatment of highly specific m6A inhibitor (STM2457) effectively inhibited HCC cell line growth and suppressed spontaneous HCC formation in mice driven by liver-specific Tp53 knockout and Myc overexpression. Using GLORI-seq, we delineated a single-base-resolution m6A landscape in human HCC cell lines. Interestingly, we identified three core enzymes in the SSP (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) as novel targets of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In these SSP genes, m6A modification recruited m6A reader IGF2BP3 to stabilize their mRNA transcripts, thereby enhancing their mRNA and protein expression in HCC cells. Most importantly, our GLORI-seq data revealed that sorafenib-resistant HCC cells elevated m6A modification in SSP genes to promote protein expression and antioxidant production. STM2457 treatment attenuated the serine synthesis pathway, induced oxidative stress, and sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib treatments. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting m6A could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","Therapy resistance is a well-known phenomenon in cancer treatment. It can be intrinsic or acquired, accountable for frequent tumor relapse and death worldwide. The interplay between cancer cells and their neighboring environment can activate complex signaling mechanisms influencing epigenetic changes and maintain cancer cell survival leading to the malignant phenotype. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and constitute the primary source of drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Studies have shown that cancer cells exhibit dysregulated RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) ""writers,"" ""erasers,"" and ""readers"" levels after acquiring drug resistance. The present review provides novel insight into the role of m6A modifiers involved in CSC generation, cancer cell proliferation, and therapy resistance. m6A RNA modifications in the cross-talk between CSC and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have also been highlighted. Further, we have discussed the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A machinery for cancer diagnosis and the development of new therapies for cancer treatment.",1
"PurposeDue to the rarity of primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL), the prognostic factors and optimal management of PGIL have not been clearly defined. We aimed to establish prognostic models using a deep learning algorithm for survival prediction.MethodsWe collected 11,168 PGIL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to form the training and test cohorts. At the same time, we collected 82 PGIL patients from three medical centres to form the external validation cohort. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model, random survival forest (RSF) model, and neural multitask logistic regression (DeepSurv) model to predict PGIL patients’ overall survival (OS).ResultsThe 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of PGIL patients in the SEER database were 77.1%, 69.4%, 63.7%, and 50.3%, respectively. The RSF model based on all variables showed that the top three most important variables for predicting OS were age, histological type, and chemotherapy. The independent risk factors for PGIL patient prognosis included sex, age, race, primary site, Ann Arbor stage, histological type, symptom, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, according to the Lasso regression analysis. Using these factors, we built the CoxPH and DeepSurv models. The DeepSurv model’s C-index values were 0.760 in the training cohort, 0.742 in the test cohort, and 0.707 in the external validation cohort, which demonstrated that the DeepSurv model performed better compared to the RSF model (0.728) and the CoxPH model (0.724). The DeepSurv model accurately predicted 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year OS. Both calibration curves and decision curve analysis curves demonstrated the superior performance of the DeepSurv model. We developed the DeepSurv model as an online web calculator for survival prediction, which can be accessed at  DeepSurv model with external validation is superior to previous studies in predicting short-term and long-term survival and can help us make better-individualized decisions for PGIL patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05123-0.","Purpose of reviewPatients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (BCR) after unsuccessful curative therapies frequently have an indolent and asymptomatic disease course for years. There are no prospective data showing that treating BCR improves overall survival despite new imaging strategies and emerging therapeutic data. Managing BCR requires a unique perspective in oncology that balances toxicities and disease kinetics.Recent findingsProstate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) imaging is now widely available and can define subclinical disease in patients with BCR who otherwise have negative CT and bone scans, but limited data exists showing that treating PSMA-positive disease has long term impact. A phase 3 trial demonstrated that the androgen receptor pathway inhibitor enzalutamide either alone or with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was superior in delaying metastasis, relative to ADT alone. Survival benefits from this study remain unknown.SummaryBCR is a heterogeneous population where overtreatment may present greater risk to patients than a disease course that is often indolent. Management of BCR should be individualized based on disease kinetics. Given the unique biology of BCR, future therapeutic research should emphasize an approach that alters disease trajectory without accompanying side effects and should explore options beyond ADT-based strategies.",0
"BackgroundThe prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally, impacting individuals in Western nations and rapid growing in Asian countries due to sedentary lifestyles; thus, NAFLD has emerged as a significant worldwide health concern. Presently, lifestyle changes represent the primary approach to managing NAFLD.MethodsThis research aimed to identify the potential drug targets for treating NAFLD through comprehensive in silico computational analysis. These include the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of the protein, the prediction of inhibitors by PubChem and ZINC, molecular docking by Autodcok, pharmacophore modeling, molecular dynamics simulation by the OPLS_2005 force field, and the orthorhombic box solvent model Intermolecular Interaction Potential 3 Points Transferable to the selected compound. The toxicity of the lead compounds was analyzed through AdmetSAR software.ResultsThe protein associated with the PNPLA3 gene, whose overall three-dimensional structure was 95% accurate, were retrieved following inhibitor selection via PubChem and ZINC. Among the selected inhibitors and docked compounds with ID 10033935 (ellagitannin) showed a minimum E-Score of -17.266. In docking and pharmacophore modeling the compound ellagitannin shows promise as a potenstial drug candidate. Moreover, the molecular dynamics and structural stability of the protein-ligand complex were evaluated with several metrics such as as root mean square fluctuation and root mean square deviation and resulted in the stability not only of PNPLA3-10033935 (ellagitannin) but also of compound PNPLA3-71448940 and PNPLA3-5748394 complexed proteins at 400 ns with very slight variation.ConclusionOverall, ellagitannin was identified as the best druggable target with the best therapeutics profile. The findings of our study can pave the way for the development of a new drug against NALFD.","ABSTRACTThe host ESCRT-machinery repairs damaged endolysosomal membranes. If damage persists, selective macroautophagy/autophagy clears the damaged compartment. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that damages the phagosomal membrane and targets ESCRT-mediated repair as part of its virulence program. The E3 ubiquitin ligases PRKN and SMURF1 promote autophagic capture of damaged, Mtb-containing phagosomes. Because ubiquitination is a reversible process, we anticipated that host deubiquitinases (DUBs) would also be involved. Here, we screened all predicted mouse DUBs for their role in ubiquitin targeting and control of intracellular Mtb. We show that USP8 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 8) colocalizes with intracellular Mtb, recognizes phagosomal membrane damage, and is required for ESCRT-dependent membrane repair. Furthermore, we show that USP8 regulates the NFE2L2/NRF2-dependent antioxidant signature. Taken together, our study demonstrates a central role of USP8 in promoting Mtb intracellular growth by promoting phagosomal membrane repair, limiting ubiquitin-driven selective autophagy, and reducing oxidative stress.Abbreviation: BMDMs: bone marrow-derived macrophages; CFUs: colony-forming units; DUB: deubiquitinase; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; LLOMe: L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester; MFI: mean fluorescence intensity; MOI: multiplicity of infection; Mtb: Mycobacterium tuberculosis; NFE2L2/NRF2: nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; PMA: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ROS: reactive oxygen species; USP8: ubiquitin specific peptidase 8",0
"Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T cells used for the treatment of B-cell malignancies can identify T-cell subsets with superior clinical activity. Here, using infusion products (IP) of patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), we integrated functional profiling using timelapse imaging microscopy in nanowell grids (TIMING) with subcellular profiling and scRNA-seq to identify a signature of multifunctional CD8 T cells (CD8-fit). CD8-fit cells are capable of migration, serial killing, and harbor balanced mitochondrial and lysosomal volumes. Using independent datasets, we validate that CD8-fit cells:  are present pre-manufacture and associated with clinical responses in axi-cel treated patients,  longitudinally persist in patients after treatment with CAR T cells, and  are tumor migrating, cytolytic cells capable of intratumoral expansion in solid tumors.

Loss-of-function mutation in the α1,2-fucosyltransferase (fut2) gene, which alters fucosylation on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, is one example. However, whether bacterial fucosylation can contribute to gut inflammation is unclear. Here we show that host fucosylation status influences fucosylation biosynthesis by gut commensal bacteria. Mice colonized with faecal microbiota of Fut2 knockout mice or Bacteroides fragilis with lower surface fucosylation are predisposed to colitis. This was supported by human cohort data showing that bacterial fucosylation levels decrease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and correlate with intestinal inflammation. Using a mouse model for Bacteroides fragilis to explore the role of fucosylation in gut immunity, we show that the fucosylation status of epithelial cells and bacteria is critical for maintaining B cell responses in the gut. Host-derived and dietary fucose mediate immunoglobulin A (IgA) recognition of gut microbiota, and this interaction facilitates the translocation of commensals to Peyer’s patches and alters the immune landscape of Peyer’s patches with increased germinal centre B cells and IgA-secreting antigen-specific B cells. Finally, dietary fucose enhances the IgA response against Salmonella and protects against systemic bacterial dissemination. This highlights the role of host and bacterial fucosylation in maintaining IgA homeostasis and immune escape mechanisms.",0
"Background: Low serum sodium affects cancer prognosis, but its impact on immunotherapy is unclear.Objective: Assessing the association of pre- and post-ICI treatment sodium levels with survival.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients receiving ICI in January 2012–December 2023, collecting serum sodium levels at treatment initiation and 4 weeks post-ICI, with overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome.Results: Low sodium was observed in 125 and 119 patients pre-and post-treatment respectively. Pre-ICI and post-ICI low sodium correlated with decreased OS [10.6 vs. 22.9 months (p = 0.001) and 11.6 vs. 27.2 months (p = 0.009)]. Multivariate analysis identified pre-ICI low sodium [HR: 1.685; 95% CI: 1.050–2.705; p = 0.031] as an independent risk factor for worse OS.Conclusion: Low baseline serum sodium was an independent risk factor for poor OS in patients treated with ICIs.","We present an unusual case of uveitis secondary to avelumab and pembrolizumab in a 39-year-old Taiwanese male with stage IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and lung metastasis, who initially received pembrolizumab as his primary treatment. However, the patient experienced skin and liver immune-related adverse events (irAEs) after the seventh dose of pembrolizumab, which prompted a switch to avelumab. The patient began to experience gradual blurring of vision after completing the fifth cycle of avelumab immunotherapy. Ophthalmic examinations revealed findings consistent with bilateral anterior uveitis. Despite an initial lack of significant improvement with steroid treatment, the patient’s vision and inflammation improved upon discontinuation of avelumab. Due to the occurrence of uveitis, avelumab was switched back to pembrolizumab. However, three months after initiating pembrolizumab, the patient developed foggy vision and bilateral anterior uveitis with cystoid macular edema (CME). The administration of topical, oral, and subconjunctival steroids resulted in an improvement in vision and the resolution of CME, without the need to discontinue pembrolizumab. Over the subsequent eighteen months, there has been no recurrence of uveitis, and there is no evidence of relapse or further metastasis in his ccRCC.",1
"AbstractBackgroundEarly‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in adults is commonly treated with combined modality treatment of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The role of radiotherapy has been questioned due to potential long‐term adverse effects.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.Search methodsWe updated all previous searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, MEDLINE and Embase, in trial registries and in relevant conference proceedings until November 2023.Selection criteriaWe included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and excluded trials with more than 20% of participants with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. We considered immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy eligible if both were applied similarly in the comparator groups, but did not identify such trials. For our comparisons, we separated RCTs with the same number of chemotherapy cycles in both arms and RCTs with a different number of cycles, when the chemotherapy regimens were the same. We separated RCTs which compared participants with a favourable, mixed or unfavourable risk profile.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of included trials. A third review author resolved discrepancies. We analysed time‐to‐event outcomes (overall survival, progression‐free survival) as hazard ratios (HR) and binary outcomes (adverse events) as risk ratios (RR). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.Main resultsWe included nine comparisons of eight RCTs involving 3840 participants in this updated review.Same number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseFor overall survival in individuals with favourable Hodgkin's lymphoma, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 7.92; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). Additional radiotherapy to chemotherapy is likely to improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.01 to 74.24; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and substantial imprecision) and suggests little to no difference in cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.16; 1 RCT, 667 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality or infertility.Mixed populationFor a population of mixed risk profile, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.80; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). It indicates that additional radiotherapy may lead to an improvement in progression‐free survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 10.87; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) and second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) (both very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but suggests that additional radiotherapy may increase cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.92; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with unfavourable disease, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.44; 2 RCTs, 688 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but additional radiotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.60; 1 RCT, 651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to imprecision). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.12 to 65.74; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality, second‐cancer related mortality or infertility.Different number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseThe evidence for overall survival in individuals with favourable disease treated with different numbers of chemotherapy cycles in both arms is uncertain and inclusive (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.38; 1 RCT, 357 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), yet it suggests a likely improvement in progression‐free survival with additional radiotherapy (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 RCT, 357 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). For second‐cancer‐related mortality, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.34; 1 RCT, 465 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality and infertility and data for cardiac disease‐related mortality were not estimable (no events in either group).Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with an unfavourable risk profile, additional radiotherapy may decrease overall survival slightly (HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.90; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision), but may slightly improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 6.90, 95% CI 0.36 to 132.34; 1 RCT, 276 participants), second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.77 to 6.19; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) and cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 8.22; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) (all very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Authors' conclusionsThe chemotherapy regimens in the trials differed and data for regimens commonly used today were limited. Additional radiotherapy may slightly improve progression‐free survival. The available data for overall survival and adverse events were of low and very low certainty, and we were unable to draw conclusions about the effects of additional radiotherapy on these outcomes. No studies evaluated infertility. High‐quality, longer‐term follow‐up data are required and data on fertility are needed.","AbstractRationaleHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.Eligibility criteriaParallel‐group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross‐over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi‐randomised trials for analysis.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non‐serious.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta‐analysed the outcome data at the longest follow‐up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random‐effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.Included studiesWe included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single‐centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia‐Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co‐interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information.The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow‐up was three months to five years.Synthesis of resultsTen trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions.Eight trials evaluated all‐cause mortality at varied follow‐up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow‐up periods taken together.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one‐year follow‐up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events.One trial measured health‐related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow‐up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health‐related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health‐related quality of life scores. No further data were provided.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non‐serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non‐serious.We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.We identified no ongoing trials.Authors' conclusionsBased on the low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all‐cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events considered non‐serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationProtocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014869.",1
"IntroductionInduction intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) followed by maintenance after transurethral resection of bladder tumor, is the standard adjuvant therapy for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). There is sparse evidence on the practice of intravesical BCG in Australia. Our aim was to determine the outcomes of intravesical BCG therapy in NMIBC in Southwestern Sydney.MethodsThis was a multi-center retrospective audit of NMIBC patients who received intravesical BCG between January 2008 and June 2020. Data was collected across six tertiary hospitals in South Western Sydney. Primary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), BCG induction and maintenance rates.ResultsOf the 200 eligible patients over 12.5 years, median age was 77 years and 83% were male. Of these, 55%, 4.5%, 35% and 5% were Tis, Ta, T1 and unknown stage, respectively. All patients received induction BCG and 56% received maintenance BCG (range 3-36 months). Completion rate of induction BCG was 91%. Only 9% ceased treatment due to intolerance. The median duration of cystoscopy follow-up was 17 months. After a median follow-up time of 37 months, 55% developed recurrence (29% non-muscle invasive, 32% muscle-invasive disease, 8% distant metastasis). The 1-year and 5-year DFS rates were 72% and 41% (median DFS: 39 months). The 1-year and 5-year OS rates were 98% and 87% (median OS: not reached).ConclusionThe DFS and OS rates were comparable to previous literature. This provides real-world data to assist future clinical trials in NMIBC.","An 83-year-old man presented with persistent fever after intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer. Chest computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with multiple micronodules and lymphocyte-predominant bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with a high CD4/CD8 ratio, respectively. Therefore, corticotherapy for interstitial pneumonia was initiated. Anti-fast staining of the respiratory specimens was negative; however, anti-tuberculosis treatment was added based on CT findings suggesting disseminated BCG infection. Fifty days post-admission, Mycobacterium bovis BCG was identified in the initial sputum cultures. Concomitant interstitial pneumonia and BCG infection should be considered in patients with abnormal chest imaging following intravesical BCG therapy.",1
"ABSTRACTPeople living with cancer have a profound need to understand any potential negative impacts of treatment on their everyday lives and whether the treatment itself could cause other long-term health challenges. This podcast brings together the perspectives of a patient, patient advocates and an oncologist, to highlight opportunities to better support people in understanding the possible side effects of a treatment and potential impact on quality of life. In addition to bridging gaps between the perspectives of healthcare providers and patients, it may be helpful to support people in interpreting relevant clinical trial findings. With this in mind, two accompanying visual guides use patient-friendly language to help people understand how safety and quality of life are measured in clinical trials.","AbstractDupilumab has been approved to treat a variety of atopic disorders and was the first US FDA-approved medication for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), initially approved in May 2022, with expansion in use to patients as young as 1 year of age weighing at least 15 kg in January 2024. It is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, suppressing TH2-mediated proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IgE implicated in EoE pathogenesis. Phase II and III trials in EoE have demonstrated histologic, endoscopic and symptomatic improvement in disease activity with an overall favorable safety profile. This article will review the available clinical trial data and real-world efficacy of dupilumab in EoE.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDThe inherent resistance of glioma including the recent failure of immune checkpoint blockade to prolong survival in glioma has partly been attributed to tumor heterogeneity leading to insufficient drug availability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the main clinical modality to monitor tumor growth and treatment response but cannot assess drug availability within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To this end, we developed a platform to assess blood-brain barrier disruption utilizing high field multiparametric MRI and correlative light sheet microscopy (LSM) to investigate the underlying mechanisms of response and resistance towards immunotherapy in brain tumor models. MATERIAL AND METHODSOrthotopic gliomas were grown in the syngeneic GL261 or SB28 mouse glioma models. Longitudinal contrast enhanced multiparametric MRI was performed weekly after baseline. To correlate drug distribution with BBB-D and the microvasculature, mice either received a single dose of fluorescently labelled anti-PD1 or TLR7 agonist encapsulated nanoparticle CDNP-R848 at different tumor stages. After 24 hours circulation time, vasculature was labelled through lectin-FITC perfusion. Brains were cleared with fDisco and LSM was performed. Images were segmented with Ilastik and further analysis was carried out in Imaris, Fiji and VesselVio. RESULTSIn Gl261 gliomas we achieved a response rate of 87.5% to CDNP-R848, as previously established by our group, whereas SB28 tumors were fully resistant to CDNP-R848 validating the strong immunotherapeutic resistance of SB28. In both glioma models, immunotherapies were CNS-penetrant and reached the TME without off targeting, while showing cellular specificity for myeloid cells or T cells, respectively. Gadofluorine M and Gd-DOTA allowed the assessment of different spatio-temporal patterns of BBB-D. Microbleedings as assessed by T2* imaging and BBB-D as assessed by perfusion imaging were more prominent in SB28, indicating pronounced heterogeneity in the SB28 model, likely contributing to its resistance. GfM and perfusion MRI were strongly correlated with drug distribution, indicating that these MR parameters can predict drug distribution in the TME. CONCLUSIONOur correlated MR-LSM approach therefore allows the assessment of the 3-dimensional biodistribution of checkpoint inhibitors and immunotherapeutic NP in the TME in relation to BBB-D. By validating MR-based imaging biomarkers, we aim to non-invasively predict drug availability in the complex TME of glioma.","ABSTRACTModern molecular imaging routes, such as nuclear imaging and optical imaging, derive significant advantages from nanoparticles, where multimodality use and multipurpose are key benefits. Nanoparticles also showcase benefits over traditional imaging agents in nuclear and optical imaging, including improved resolution, penetration, and specificity. The goal of this literature review was to explore recent advancements in nanomaterials within these molecular imaging techniques to expand on the current state of nanomedicine in these modalities. This review derives findings from relevant reviews, original research papers, in-human clinical trials, and patents in the literature. Au- and Fe oxide-based nanosystems are just as ubiquitous within more modern modalities due to their multimodal diagnostic and therapeutic potential. It is also repeatedly highlighted in the literature, patents, and clinical trials that the use of nanoparticles, specifically in multimodal imaging techniques and theranostics, present innovative methods in recent years, enabling researchers and clinicians to overcome the limitations of unimodal imaging modalities and further advancing accuracy in the diagnosis and treatment of important pathologies, particularly cancer. Overall, nanoparticle-based imaging represents a transformative approach in advanced imaging modalities, offering new approaches to limitations of conventional agents currently being applied in clinical settings.",0
"Background:Actinic keratoses (AK) are rough scaly patches that arise on chronically ultraviolet-exposed skin and can progress to keratinocyte carcinoma.Objective:This analysis examined the literature related to the management of AK to provide evidence-based recommendations for treatment. Grading, histologic classification, natural history, risk of progression, and dermatologic surveillance of AKs are also discussed.Methods:A multidisciplinary Work Group conducted a systematic review to address 5 clinical questions on the management of AKs and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading clinical recommendations. Graded recommendations were voted on to achieve consensus.Results:Analysis of the evidence resulted in 18 recommendations.Limitations:This analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time it was conducted. The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English language randomized trials may have excluded data published in other languages or limited identification of relevant long-term follow-up data.Conclusions:Strong recommendations are made for using ultraviolet protection, topical imiquimod, topical 5-fluorouracil, and cryosurgery. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of photodynamic therapy and diclofenac for the treatment of AK, both individually and as part of combination therapy regimens.","IntroductionThymomas are uncommon tumors that originate from epithelial cells of thymus and may have varying clinical course.Materials and MethodsA retrospective review of medical records of thymoma patients treated between January 2012 and April 2022 at our institute was conducted.Results There were a total of 23 patients (12 males and 11 females) with median age of 52 years (range, 33–77 years). Eleven patients (47.8%) had associated paraneoplastic syndromes of which 10 (43.5%) had myasthenia gravis and 1 (4.3%) had pure red cell aplasia. Average maximal tumor diameter was 62 mm (28–160 mm). Masaoka-Koga stage distribution was as follows: stage I ( n = 2, 8.7%), IIA ( n = 4, 17.4%), IIB ( n = 1, 4.3%), IIIA ( n = 2, 8.7%), IIIB ( n = 4, 17.4%), IVA ( n = 7, 30.4%), and IVB ( n = 3, 13.1%). The World Health Organization type B2 was the commonest histology ( n = 12, 52.17%), followed by B3 ( n =7, 30.4%), B1 ( n = 2, 8.7%), AB ( n = 1,4.3%), and A ( n = 1, 4.3%). Six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide regimen, 22 (95.6%) underwent surgery, and 1 patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. R0 resection was attained in 20 (91%) patients, R1 resection in 1 (4.5%) patient, and R2 in 1 (4.5%) patient. All operated patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy (45–60 Gy in 25–30 fractions). Four patients relapsed at a median duration of 14 months (2–26 months). At a median follow-up of 6 years, 5-year overall survival was 67.1% and 5-year progression-free survival was 66.6%. Local control at 5 years was 86.6%. ConclusionDespite majority of our patients presenting at an advanced stage, the local control rates are encouraging and reinforce multimodality approach.",0
"MEK inhibitors (MEKis) have shown limited success as a treatment for MAPK/ERK pathway–dependent cancers due to various resistance mechanisms tumor cells can employ. CH5126766 (CKI27) is an inhibitor that binds to MEK and prevents release of RAF, reducing the relief of negative feedback commonly observed with other MEKis. We observed that CKI27 increased MHC expression on tumor cells and improved T cell–mediated killing. Yet, CKI27 also decreased T-cell proliferation, activation, and cytolytic activity by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway that is activated downstream of T cell–receptor signaling. Therefore, we aimed to balance the positive and negative immunomodulatory effects of MEKis for optimal combination with immunotherapy. Intermittent administration of CKI27 allowed T cells to partially recover and co-stimulation via GITR and OX-40 agonist antibodies completely alleviated inhibition of function. In Kras mutant lung and colon tumor mouse models, intermittent CKI27 and anti-GITR significantly decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival when further combined with CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade. Moreover, this triple combination increased CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell proliferation, activation, and effector/memory subsets in the tumor draining lymph nodes and tumors and led to intratumoral regulatory T cell (Treg) destabilization. These data, collectively, will allow for more informed decisions when optimizing combination regimens by overcoming resistance, reducing toxicity, and generating long-term immune responses.","BackgroundDespite great advances in its early diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer is still an intractable disease and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and morbidity in the world. The family of Polo-like kinases (PLKs) consists of five serine/threonine kinases, which have been reported to participate in various human diseases. However, the expression and prognostic value of each PLK in human lung cancer have not been fully understood. This study analyzed mRNA expression and prognostic value of different PLKs in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsFirst, mRNA expression of PLKs in patients with NSCLC from the Oncomine and the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database was investigated. Then, a Kaplan–Meier plotter was employed for survival analysis. The sequence alteration for PLKs was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the cBioPortal database. Additionally, we analyzed the association among different PLKs using the LinkedOmics database. Finally, the enrichment analysis of PLKs was achieved using the DAVID database.ResultsThe mRNA expression levels of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly overexpressed, while mRNA expression level of PLK3 was underexpressed in patients with NSCLC. mRNA expressions of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly and positively related to the tumor stage of NSCLC. Increased expressions of PLK1, PLK4, and PLK5 and decreased expression of PLK2 were attributed to limited overall survival time in NSCLC. PLK1 was positively correlated with PLK4 via the LinkedOmics database.ConclusionsPLKs are relevant targets for NSCLC treatment, especially PLK1 and PLK4.",1
"ResumenLas enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales son entidades crónicas con manifestaciones y evolución heterogéneas, por lo que constituyen un desafío diagnóstico y terapéutico. En los últimos años se han producido cambios trascendentales en el manejo de las enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales, de la mano del mayor conocimiento de su inmunofisiopatología y evolución a largo plazo. A diferencia de otras enfermedades, la clínica no es soberana y debemos respaldarnos en parámetros más certeros de inflamación para la toma de decisiones. Con el advenimiento de nuevas herramientas bioquímicas, de imágenes y endoscópicas, el enfoque actual está dirigido a lograr un menor retraso en el diagnóstico y un monitoreo estrecho de la curación mucosa como una de las metas fundamentales asociada a una evolución favorable. El objetivo de esta revisión es actualizar los nuevos conceptos respecto a estrategias diagnósticas y de monitoreo en las enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The introduction of biologics, particularly anti-interleukin (IL) agents, has revolutionized IBD treatment. This review summarizes the role of ILs in IBD pathophysiology and describes the efficacy and positioning of anti-IL therapies. We discuss the functions of key ILs in IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets. The review then discusses anti-IL therapies, focusing primarily on ustekinumab (anti-IL-12/23), risankizumab (anti-IL-23), and mirikizumab (anti-IL-23). Clinical trial data demonstrate their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The safety profiles of these agents are generally favorable. However, long-term safety data for newer agents are still limited. The review also briefly discusses emerging therapies such as guselkumab and brazikumab. Network meta-analyses suggest that anti-IL therapies perform well compared to other biological agents. These agents may be considered first- or second-line therapies for many patients, especially those with comorbidities or safety concerns. Anti-IL therapies represent a significant advancement in IBD treatment, offering effective and relatively safe options for patients with moderate to severe disease.",1
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious, progressive, and irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid β-protein (Aβ) to form senile plaques and abnormal phosphorylation of intracellular tau protein to form neuronal fiber tangles. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and there are several hypotheses, primarily including the Aβ cascade hypothesis, the neurofibrillary tangle hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, and the cholinergic hypothesis. It has been suggested that the dysregulation of multiple energy metabolic pathways, especially mitochondria metabolism, may be related to the severity of AD pathology and disease symptoms in the brain. The modification of histone (lysine) methylation, an actively regulated and reversible process, is closely related to energy metabolism and plays a crucial role in AD development. In summary, histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD restricted and regulated each other. Here, we review the advances in the correlation between histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD. This can provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and its control.","AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.",0
"Brain tumors in children are a devastating disease in a high proportion of patients. Because of inconsistent results in clinical trials in unstratified patients, the role of immunotherapy remains unclear. We performed an in-depth survey of the single-cell transcriptomes and clonal relationship of intra-tumoral T cells from children with brain tumors. Our results demonstrate that a large fraction of T cells in the tumor tissue are clonally expanded with potential to recognize tumor antigens. Such clonally-expanded T cells display enrichment of transcripts linked to effector function, tissue-residency, immune checkpoints, and signatures of neoantigen-specific T cells and immunotherapy response. We identify neoantigens in pediatric brain tumors, and show that neoantigen-specific T cell gene signatures are linked to better survival outcomes. Notably, among the patients in our cohort, we observe substantial heterogeneity in the degree of clonal expansion and magnitude of T cell response. Our findings suggest that characterization of intra-tumoral T cell responses may enable selection of patients for immunotherapy, an approach that requires prospective validation in clinical trials.","Background:Approximately 30% of cancer patients experience kidney complications, which hinder optimal cancer management, imposing a burden on patients’ quality of life and the healthcare system. The etiology of kidney complications in cancer patients is often attributed to oncological therapies. However, the direct impact of cancer on kidney health is underestimated. Our previous study demonstrated that metastatic lung cancer adversely alters the kidney, and exacerbates chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, indicating lung cancer-kidney crosstalk. The current study examines whether this phenomenon is specific to the employed cancer model.Methods:Female and male mice of various strains were injected with different cell lines of remote organ cancer, and their kidney tissues were analyzed for toxicity and fibrosis.Results:The impact of cancer on the kidney varied by cancer type. Breast cancer and specific subtypes of lung cancer, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant cancer, pathologically altered kidney physiology and function in a manner dependent on the metastatic potential of the cell line. This was independent of mouse strain, sex, and cancer cell line origin. Moreover, tumor DNA was not detected in the renal tissue, excluding metastases to the kidney as a causative factor for the observed pathological alterations. Lewis lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma did not cause nephrotoxicity, regardless of the tumor size.Conclusion:Our results confirm cancer-kidney crosstalk in specific cancer types. In the era of precision medicine, further research is essential to identify at-risk oncology populations, enabling early detection and management of renal complications.NEW & NOTEWORTHYCancer patients frequently experience kidney complications, often attributed to antineoplastic therapies. This emphasis on therapy-induced nephrotoxicity has led to the underestimation of the impact of cancer on the kidney. Our study demonstrates that distant organ cancer is sufficient to induce nephrotoxicity, highlighting the existence of cancer-kidney crosstalk. Our findings underscore a gap in our understanding of renal complications in cancer patients and provide a rationale for identifying the underlying mechanisms for the development of nephroprotective agents.",0
"BackgroundBladder cancer (BLCA) is a prevalent urological tumor with high morbidity and mortality. However, BLCA treatment remains challenging due to a lack of effective biomarkers. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), as active participants in tumor progression are involved in multiple biological regulatory mechanisms, and cuproptosis-related genes participate in the development of cancer. It is important to discover cuproptosis- related lncRNAs for BLCA diagnosis and treatment.MethodsA predictive signature was constructed based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses of the 9 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs. Samples were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group based on their median risk scores to explore their prognosis.ResultsThis signature is well predictive, as evidenced by the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) and K-M curves. Based on the nomogram, we were able to visually forecast the survival rates of patients with BLCA at 1-, 3-, and 5-year, and the calibration plots displayed that the actual results were well matched with the predicted 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, BLCA patients in the high-risk group had a higher Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score and lower TMB. Finally, we investigated the response of antitumor drugs for BLCA patients in different risk groups, and a statistically significant difference was observed in the sensitivity of those drugs between low- and the high-risk groups.ConclusionAccording to the 9 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs, we constructed a signature which can be served as a promising prognostic biomarker for BLCA patients.","Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3) is a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein family expressed in the extracellular matrix closely associated with the development and occurrence of various malignant tumors; yet, its function in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is still poorly understood. The following study investigated the progress and mechanism of HAPLN3 on ccRCC using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments. In order to determine whether HAPLN3 is differentially expressed in ccRCC, we analyzed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE40435 and further validated them in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Simultaneously, the TCGA dataset was utilized to study the relationship between HAPLN3 expression and the progression of ccRCC and its prognostic value in ccRCC. Gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore HAPLN3-related signaling pathways in ccRCC. The TIMER database investigates the link for both HAPLN3 and immune cell infiltration. Different ccRCC cell lines the role of HAPLN3 on cell biological behavior in vitro. HAPLN3 was increased in ccRCC, and its high expression was related to the patients' survival rates and clinical characteristics. GSEA showed that HAPLN3 is mainly enriched in proliferative and metastatic pathways. In addition, HAPLN3 was an independently associated significant predictor in patients with ccRCC. Functional experiments demonstrated that HAPLN3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. To sum up, our data suggest that HAPLN3 may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.",1
"Introduction: Pancreatic cancer, which results from the uncontrolled growth of pancreatic cells, is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. About 90% of instances of pancreatic cancer are pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and occasionally ""pancreatic cancer"" is used exclusively to describe this subtype. Nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and FOLFIRINOX are examples of modern chemotherapeutic drugs that have the ability to quickly confer resistance in pancreatic tumor cells. Therefore, in order to treat this dreadful condition, it is essential to develop more effective medicines. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) causes pancreatic cancer cells to die apoptotically. In eukaryotes, UPS is an essential mechanism for protein breakdown. Pancreatic cancer cells are more susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress) and apoptosis when treated with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that is the first in this group of drugs approved for the treatment of cancer, especially multiple myeloma. Methods: Searching through PubMed and Google Scholar and gathering data.Results: UPS is still a popular target for pancreatic cancer treatment among researchers. However, despite the favorable results of UPS-based therapies in vitro and in vivo, the clinical results are not as promising as expected.Conclusion: A deep understanding of it, is essential to achieving the maximum results. In this review, we aim to look into the UPS along with searching for the novelist therapies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma based on manipulating it.","PurposeImmunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors against anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), has not been successful in treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), dendritic cells (DCs), and the TGF-β cytokine are critical in anti-cancer immunity. We hypothesized that TGF-β enhances the immunosuppressive effects of TAM, MDSC, and DC presence in tumors.MethodsUsing a murine PDAC cell line derived from a genetically engineered mouse model, we orthotopically implanted treated cells plus drug embedded in Matrigel into immunocompetent mice. Treatments included saline control, TGF-β1, or a TGF-β receptor 1 small molecule inhibitor, galunisertib. We investigated TAM, MDSC, DC, and TAM PD-L1 expression with flow cytometry in tumors. Separately, we used the TIMER2.0 database to analyze TAM and PD-L1 gene expression in human PDAC tumors in TCGA database.ResultsTGF-β did not alter MDSC or DC frequencies in the primary tumors. However, in PDAC metastases to the liver, TGF-β decreased the proportion of MDSCs (P=0.022) and DCs (P=0.005). TGF-β significantly increased the percent of high PD-L1 expressing TAMs (32 ± 6 % vs. 12 ± 5%, P=0.013) but not the proportion of TAMs in primary and metastatic tumors. TAM PD-L1 gene expression in TCGA PDAC database was significantly correlated with tgb1 and tgfbr1 gene expression (P<0.01).ConclusionsTGF-β is important in PDAC anti-tumor immunity, demonstrating context-dependent impact on immune cells. TGF-β has an overall immunosuppressive effect mediated by TAM PD-L1 expression and decreased presence of DCs. Future investigations will focus on enhancing anti-cancer immune effects of TGF-β receptor inhibition.",1
"ABSTRACTHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer-related death with limited therapies, is a complex disease developing in a background of Hepatitis Virus infection or systemic conditions, such as the metabolic syndrome. Investigating HCC pathogenesis in model organisms is therefore crucial for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been instrumental in recapitulating the local and systemic features of HCC. Early studies using GEMMs and patient material implicated members of the dimeric Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, such as c-Jun and c-Fos, in HCC formation. In a recent report, we described how switchable, hepatocyte-restricted expression of a single-chain c-Jun~Fra-2 protein, functionally mimicking the c-Jun/Fra-2 AP-1 dimer, results in spontaneous and largely reversible liver tumors in GEMMs. Dysregulated cell cycle, inflammation, and dyslipidemia are observed at early stages and tumors display molecular HCC signatures. We demonstrate that increased c-Myc expression is an essential molecular determinant of tumor formation that can be therapeutically targeted using the BET inhibitor JQ1. Here, we discuss these findings with additional results illustrating how AP-1 GEMMs can foster preclinical research on liver diseases with novel perspectives offered by the constantly increasing wealth of HCC-related datasets.","PurposeThis research aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of baseline prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for the outcome of individuals diagnosed with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on data from 810 patients with non-metastatic NPC who underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. The best cut-offs for PNI and LDH were identified by X-tile software to be 48.5 and 150, respectively. To find the independent prognostic factors for survival outcomes, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted, and AUCs were used to compare their prognostic values.ResultsMultivariate analysis revealed that patients with PNI > 48.5 had better overall survival (OS) (HR: 0.502, P < 0.001), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 0.618, P < 0.001), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (HR: 0.637, P = 0.005). Higher LDH was associated with poorer OS (HR: 1.798, P < 0.001), PFS (HR: 1.671, P < 0.001), and DMFS (HR: 1.756, P < 0.001). The combination of low PNI and high LDH in non-metastatic NPC patients was correlated with poor OS (P < 0.001), PFS (P < 0.001), and DMFS (P < 0.001). The combination of PNI and LDH had the highest AUCs for predicting OS, PFS, and DMFS.ConclusionsPNI and LDH might become valuable predictors of the prognosis of non-metastatic NPC patients undergoing IMRT with or without chemotherapy. Prognostic accuracy can be enhanced by combining PNI and LDH.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDB-raf proto-oncogene (BRAF)-mutant melanoma brain metastases (BRAF MBM) are associated with poor prognosis. Amidst our large institutional experience treating patients with BRAF MBM with multimodality therapy, our aim was to identify disease and treatment-related prognostic features, accounting for longitudinal sequence of events, to inform clinical decision-making. METHODSWe retrospectively reviewed electronic health records of 100 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosed with BRAF MBM. Demographic, disease, and clinical factors including treatment sequencing were tabulated. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the study population and non-parametric tests were used to evaluate differences across groups. A multivariable Cox regression identified factors associated with overall survival (OS) following BRAF MBM diagnosis. RESULTSMedian follow-up was 22 months and median OS was 33.5 months. Patients received an average [standard deviation (SD)] of 3.36 [1.06] unique therapies. After adjustment for covariates, greater number of brain metastases at initial diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.3 [1.14-4.62], p=0.01 for 3-10 metastases and HR 2.54 [1.01-6.36], p=0.04 for >10 metastases, respectively), receipt of combination IO and targeted therapy prior to BRAF MBM diagnosis (HR 2.91 [1.08-7.86], p=0.03), and receipt of no unique subsequent therapy after initial management strategy (HR 3.89 [1.48-10.16], p=0.005) were significantly associated with worse OS. CONCLUSIONSDespite heterogeneity in individual treatment sequences, patients with greater intracranial disease burden and those receiving combination targeted and immunotherapy prior to BRAF MBM diagnoses had the worst outcomes. Dynamic changes in therapy resistance may inform optimal treatment strategies for individuals with BRAF MBM.","PurposeProcalcitonin (PCT) is an inflammatory marker elevated in bacteremia and bacterial pneumonia. We aimed to assess the real-world diagnostic accuracy of PCT in hospitalized patients with malignancy.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 715 patients with cancer who had PCT measured during 750 admissions was analyzed. Diagnosis of bacteremia was determined using blood culture data. Diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was based on radiographic infiltrate and/or sputum culture. PCT’s performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and specificity.ResultsPatients had bacteremia, bacterial pneumonia, or both during 210 admissions (28%). PCT elevation above 0.5 ng/mL was significantly associated with diagnosed infection in the overall population (p < 0.0001) and in subgroups with solid tumor malignancies (p < 0.0001) and hematologic malignancies (p = 0.008). PCT was associated with infectious status in patients with any metastases, but not those with primary lung cancer, lung metastases, neuroendocrine tumors, febrile neutropenia, or history of bone marrow transplant (BMT). The area under the ROC curve for PCT in the overall population was 0.655. An ideal cutoff of 0.21 ng/mL led to a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 59%. At cutoffs of 0.5 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, PCT’s sensitivity was 39% and 94%, while specificity was 79% and 17%, respectively.ConclusionIn this large cohort of hospitalized oncology patients, PCT elevation was associated with diagnosed bacteremia and/or bacterial pneumonia. However, specificity was limited, and PCT elevation was not associated with diagnosed infection in some subpopulations. While PCT may have some diagnostic utility for hospitalized oncology patients, values must be interpreted cautiously and considering clinical context.",0
"Background and Clinical Significance: Radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) following immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has been infrequently reported. Case Presentation: We present a 47-year-old female patient who developed RRD of the breast following three doses of pembrolizumab administered as an adjuvant treatment post-nephrectomy for Stage III renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Notably, the affected breast had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy 247 weeks earlier for Stage IA invasive ductal carcinoma. She had received no prior chemotherapy at any point. RRD manifested as breast induration, erythema, and peau d’orange, and contraction of breast volume was noted following three cycles of pembrolizumab on week 17 (400 mg dose every 6 weeks). The dermatitis responded rapidly to systemic corticosteroids and no treatment interruption was needed. Conclusions: To date, this is the longest reported interval from completion of radiotherapy to RRD. A literature search underscores the variability in presentation and management of ICI-associated RRD.","AbstractBiliary tract cancers (BTCs) have rising incidence and mortality rates. Chemotherapy’s limited efficacy has led to exploring new treatments like immunotherapy. which offers modest benefits. Moreover, the identification of reliable predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint therapy in BTCs remains elusive, hindering personalized treatment strategies. This review provides an overview of the current landscape of emerging biomarkers for immunotherapy response in BTCs. We discuss the incremental benefits of combination therapy and the evolving role of immunotherapy in managing advanced BTC. Additionally, we highlight the need for robust predictive biomarkers to optimize treatment outcomes and foster a more individualized approach to patient care. We aim to identify promising research avenues and strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and patient survival in BTCs.",1
"ObjectivesThis study aims to develop and validate a prognostic signature based on 7-methylguanosine-related (M7G-related) miRNAs for predicting prognosis and immune implications in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA).Materials and methodsM7G-related miRNA data of BRCA were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized, univariate, and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct the prognostic signature. Furthermore, the predictive validity was verified using Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival risk and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Internal random sampling verification was used to simplify and validate the signature. RT-qPCR was used to quantify the expression level of transcriptional profiles. The independent prognostic role of the risk score was validated using univariate and multivariate regression. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was used for functional and immune enrichment analysis.ResultsA total of 18 M7G-related miRNAs were identified to construct the prognostic signature in BRCA. The low-risk group exhibited significantly higher overall survival than the high-risk group in the KM survival plot (P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals in the ROC curve were 0.737, 0.724, and 0.702, respectively. The survival significance in the training and testing cohorts was confirmed by random sampling verification. The most prominent miRNAs in the signature were the miR-7, miR-139, miR-10b, and miR-4728. Furthermore, immune scores for B, mast, and Th1 cells varied between risk groups. Our research demonstrated that CD52 was the most positively correlated gene with immune cells and functions in BRCA.ConclusionOur study presents a comprehensive and systematic analysis of M7G-related miRNAs to construct a prognostic signature in BRCA. The signature demonstrated excellent prognostic validity, with the risk score as an independent prognostic factor. These results provide critical evidence for further investigation of M7G miRNAs and offer new insights for BRCA patients in the context of effective immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04849-1.","AbstractBackgroundThe rate of primary surgery for human papillomavirus (HPV)–related oropharynx cancer has recently declined, whereas use of transoral robotic surgery has lagged at community cancer centers. We hypothesize that differences in overall survival exist between patients undergoing surgery for HPV-related oropharynx cancer at community centers and low transoral robotic surgery volume (<15 transoral robotic surgeries per year) academic centers and high transoral robotic surgery volume (≥15 transoral robotic surgeries per year) academic centers.MethodsPatients from the US National Cancer Database with a diagnosis of HPV-related oropharynx cancer from 2010 to 2019 who underwent primary surgical treatment were included. Trends in transoral robotic surgery use, rates of positive surgical margins, quality of adjuvant treatment, and 5-year overall survival were compared between community centers, low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers, and high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers.ResultsA total of 5406 patients met study criteria. A clinically and statistically significantly lower proportion of patients at community centers underwent transoral robotic surgery than at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers or high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers (26.2% vs 44.0% vs 73.9%, respectively; P < .001). The rate of positive surgical margins was clinically and statistically significantly higher at community centers than at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers or high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers (25.7% vs 15.3% vs 9.2%, respectively; P < .001). A greater proportion of patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) received prolonged courses (23.6% vs 13.1% vs 8.8%; P < .001) or excessive doses (16.5% vs 11.5% vs 8.7%; P < .001) of RT at community centers than at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers or high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers, respectively. Five-year overall survival was lowest at community centers (85.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 81.7% to 88.2%), intermediate at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers (88.9%, 95% CI = 87.2% to 90.4%), and highest at high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers (91.4%, 95% CI = 89.5% to 92.9%; Plog-rank < .01).ConclusionsClinically and statistically significant differences in the type and quality of surgical and adjuvant treatment for HPV-related oropharynx cancer exist between facility types based on transoral robotic surgery volume. Overall survival was lowest at community centers, intermediate at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers, and highest at high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers.",0
"ABSTRACTCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique class of covalently closed single-stranded RNA molecules that play diverse roles in normal physiology and pathology. Among the major types of circRNA, exon-intron circRNA (EIciRNA) distinguishes itself by its sequence composition and nuclear localization. Recent RNA-seq technologies and computational methods have facilitated the detection and characterization of EIciRNAs, with features like circRNA intron retention (CIR) and tissue-specificity being characterized. EIciRNAs have been identified to exert their functions via mechanisms such as regulating gene transcription, and the physiological relevance of EIciRNAs has been reported. Within this review, we present a summary of the current understanding of EIciRNAs, delving into their identification and molecular functions. Additionally, we emphasize factors regulating EIciRNA biogenesis and the physiological roles of EIciRNAs based on recent research. We also discuss the future challenges in EIciRNA exploration, underscoring the potential for novel functions and functional mechanisms of EIciRNAs for further investigation.","Significance:Oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation are inducers of tissue injury. Alternative splicing (AS) is an essential regulatory step for diversifying the eukaryotic proteome. Human diseases link AS to OS; however, the underlying mechanisms must be better understood.Recent Advances:Genome‑wide profiling studies identify new differentially expressed genes induced by OS-dependent ischemia/reperfusion injury. Overexpression of RNA-binding protein RBFOX1 protects against inflammation. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α directs polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 to regulate mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ceacam1) AS under OS conditions. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L variant 1 contains an RGG/RG motif that coordinates with transcription factors to influence human CEACAM1 AS. Hypoxia intervention involving short interfering RNAs directed to long-noncoding RNA 260 polarizes M2 macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype and alleviates OS by inhibiting IL-28RA gene AS.Critical Issues:Protective mechanisms that eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important for resolving imbalances that lead to chronic inflammation. Defects in AS can cause ROS generation, cell death regulation, and the activation of innate and adaptive immune factors. We propose that AS pathways link redox regulation to the activation or suppression of the inflammatory response during cellular stress.Future Directions:Emergent studies using molecule-mediated RNA splicing are being conducted to exploit the immunogenicity of AS protein products. Deciphering the mechanisms that connect misspliced OS and pathologies should remain a priority. Controlled release of RNA directly into cells with clinical applications is needed as the demand for innovative nucleic acid delivery systems continues to be demonstrated.",1
"The vast number of genomic and molecular alterations in cancer pose a substantial challenge to uncovering the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and identifying therapeutic targets. High-throughput functional genomic methods in genetically engineered mouse models allow for rapid and systematic investigation of cancer driver genes. In this review, we discuss the basic concepts and tools for multiplexed investigation of functionally important cancer genes in vivo using autochthonous cancer models. Furthermore, we highlight emerging technical advances in the field, potential opportunities for future investigation, and outline a vision for integrating multiplexed genetic perturbations with detailed molecular analyses to advance our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of cancer.","BackgroundB7-H3 is a cell surface immunomodulatory glycoprotein overexpressed in prostate cancers (PC). Understanding its longitudinal expression at emergence of castration-resistance, and association with tumour genomics, is critical to the development of and patient selection for B7-H3 targeted therapies.ObjectiveTo characterize B7-H3 expression in same-patient, castration-sensitive PC (CSPC) and castration-resistant PC (CRPC) biopsies, associating this with PC genomics, and to evaluate the antitumour activity of an anti-B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in human CRPC in vitro and in vivo.Design, setting, and participantsWe performed IHC and next generation sequencing on a cohort of 98 clinically annotated, CRPC biopsies, among which 72 patients had CSPC biopsies for analyses. We analysed two CRPC transcriptome and exome datasets. PC organoids (PDX-Os) were derived from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generated from human CRPC biopsies.Outcome measurementsWe evaluated B7-H3 mRNA expression in relation to a panel of 770 immune-related genes; compared B7-H3 protein expression between same-patient CSPC and CRPC biopsies; determined associations with PC genomic alterations; evaluated the antitumour activity of DS-7300a, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor payload anti-B7-H3 ADC, in human PC cell lines, organoids and xenografts of different histologies, B7-H3 expressions, and genomics.Results and limitationsB7-H3 was one of the most highly expressed immunomodulatory genes in CRPCs. Most CSPCs (97%) and CRPCs (93%) expressed B7-H3 and conversion from B7-H3 positive to negative, or vice versa, during progression from CSPC to CRPC was rare. B7-H3 is overexpressed in tumours with defective DNA repair (DDR) gene (ATM, BRCA1/2) alterations compared to tumours without DDR gene alteration. DS7300a had antitumour activity against B7-H3 expressing human PC models including cell lines, PDX-Os and PDXs of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine histology.ConclusionsB7-H3 is overexpressed in the majority of PCs, especially DDR defective tumours. B7-H3 positive CRPC may be targeted with an anti-B7-H3 ADC.Patient summaryB7-H3, a protein expressed on the surface of most lethal PC, and in particular those with specific mutations, can be targeted using drugs that bind B7-H3 and carry potent chemotherapies. These drugs are being evaluated in cancer patients.",0
"Objective:There are significant disparities in outcomes among Hispanic patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recent studies have demonstrated favorable outcomes of pegaspargase-containing ALL regimens (PEG-CAR) in young adults however, outcomes in Hispanic ethnicity continue to be underreported.Methods:We evaluated outcomes of newly diagnosed, adult B-cell ALL Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients consecutively treated with a PEG-CAR or HyperCVAD between January 2011 and November 2022. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) while secondary endpoints included cumulative incidence of relapse and overall survival (OS).Results:Among 105 included patients, 48 (45.7%) were treated with a PEG-CAR and 57 (54.3%) with HyperCVAD. Median age was 38 years (range, 18–75 years), 61% were Hispanic, and 35.2% had poor-genetic risk. Hispanic patients demonstrated significantly worse 5-year EFS with a PEG-CAR compared to that seen with HyperCVAD (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.32–5.04; p = .006) whereas non-Hispanic patients had better outcomes with PIR (52.4% vs. 42.0%). Hispanic ethnicity (p = .015) and male sex (p = .019) were independent predictors for poor OS.Conclusions:Hispanic patients with B-cell ALL had worse EFS with a PEG-CAR as compared with HyperCVAD. Future studies will aim to confirm these findings and establish a tailored treatment approach for this high-risk population.","In recent years, the therapeutic landscape for hematological malignancies has markedly advanced, particularly since the inaugural approval of autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy in 2017 for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Autologous CAR-T therapy involves the genetic modification of a patient’s T cells to specifically identify and attack cancer cells, while bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) function by binding to both cancer cells and immune cells simultaneously, thereby triggering an immune response against the tumor. The subsequent approval of various CAR-T therapies and BsAbs have revolutionized the treatment of multiple hematological malignancies, highlighting high response rates and a subset of patients achieving prolonged disease control. This review explores the mechanisms underlying autologous CAR-T therapies and BsAbs, focusing on their clinical application in multiple myeloma, ALL, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We provide comprehensive insights into their individual efficacy, limitations concerning broad application, and the potential of combination therapies. These upcoming strategies aim to propel the field forward, paving the way for safer and more effective therapeutic interventions in hematological malignancies.",1
"ABSTRACTBreast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms affecting women worldwide, and it remains a leading cause of both mortality and morbidity. While genetic predisposition plays a critical role in the development of this neoplasm, significant epigenetic dysregulations accompany existing variants. The emergence of acquired drug resistance to current chemotherapeutics poses a significant challenge in managing therapy. However, progress has been made in developing novel agents that directly target epigenetic modifications. These agents, called “epi-drugs,” can be used alone in the clinic or in combination with current treatment regimens, offering the potential to create diversified effects on the disease’s predictive process. Within the scope of this review, general information about the major epigenetic dysregulations in breast cancer will be provided, and their effects on the molecular mechanisms in the carcinogenesis process will be discussed. Furthermore, current treatment approaches for breast cancer will be explored, classifying these epi-drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), histone acetyltransferases (HATIs), and others that have been developed to target these mechanisms. Predictions regarding the future prospects of these epi-drugs are highlighted, and their contributions to the field of personalized medicine are emphasized based on the results obtained from clinical studies.","Phenotypic plasticity, the capacity of cells to transition between distinct phenotypic and lineage states over time, is a genetically and epigenetically encoded trait essential for normal development and adult tissue homeostasis. In cancer, phenotypic plasticity programs can be deployed aberrantly to enable disease progression and acquired therapeutic resistance. Cancer phenotypic plasticity is a current barrier to achieving cures for advanced cancers using available molecularly targeted therapies. This review summarizes the complex and interconnected molecular pathways implicated in phenotypic plasticity, both in the context of normal tissue homeostasis and cancer. Molecular pathways convergent between these contexts are highlighted while pathways enabling plasticity are distinguished from those that specify the phenotype of already plastic cells. Key unresolved questions in the field are discussed along with emerging technologies that may be used to help answer them.",1
"AbstractBiliary tract cancers (BTCs) have rising incidence and mortality rates. Chemotherapy’s limited efficacy has led to exploring new treatments like immunotherapy. which offers modest benefits. Moreover, the identification of reliable predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint therapy in BTCs remains elusive, hindering personalized treatment strategies. This review provides an overview of the current landscape of emerging biomarkers for immunotherapy response in BTCs. We discuss the incremental benefits of combination therapy and the evolving role of immunotherapy in managing advanced BTC. Additionally, we highlight the need for robust predictive biomarkers to optimize treatment outcomes and foster a more individualized approach to patient care. We aim to identify promising research avenues and strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and patient survival in BTCs.","A 69-year-old woman with left-sided breast cancer developed elevated creatine kinase levels and muscle weakness in her extremities after treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient was diagnosed with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related myositis. Although the patient had no symptoms of dysphagia, we evaluated her swallowing function because esophageal dysfunction is a known complication of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study detected barium residues in the lower esophagus. Furthermore, high-resolution manometry showed impaired upper esophageal sphincter opening and absence of esophageal peristalsis, which improved partially after immunotherapy. These findings suggest that esophageal dysfunction may be an unrecognized complication of ICI-related myositis.",1
"ObjectiveEndoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important in melanoma development and progression. This study aimed to explore the prognostic value of ERS-associated lncRNA profiles in cutaneous melanoma (CM). MethodsThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides the raw data of CM. GSEA website was used to obtain ERS-related genes, and mRNA and LncRNA co-expression network were used to obtain ERS-related lncRNAs. A Lasso regression analysis was used to identify a prognostic risk model for the composition of ERS-related lncRNAs. Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the model’s risk score. The researchers then compared the two groups’ survival rates, immune infiltration, chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity, and immune checkpoint gene expression.ResultsThirty-nine ERS-related lncRNAs were discovered to be prognostic. A prognostic risk model made up of ten ERS-related lncRNAs was discovered. Patients in the low-risk group had a better prognosis than those in the high-risk group. An examination of tumor microenvironment revealed that risk scores correlated with immune cell infiltration in eight cases. Dacarbazine, paclitaxel, and cisplatin, three chemotherapy drugs, were more sensitive in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group. ConclusionThis study identified a risk model of ten ERS-related lncRNAs that have significant prognostic value in CM and could help guide clinical treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04086-y.","ObjectiveTo compare the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) combined with intravesical chemotherapy (IVC) against intravesical BCG immunotherapy in high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT).Materials and methods130 patients with high-risk NMIBC who had underwent TURBT were divided into two groups, of which IAC + IVC group received four courses of IAC (cisplatin and epirubicin) combined with IVC (epirubicin or pirarubicin) after surgery and BCG group received intravesical BCG immunotherapy. Recurrence rate and progression rate were assessed by Chi-square test, while recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method.ResultsIn this study, the recurrence rate was 27.9% (12/43) in IAC + IVC group and 26.4% (14/53) in BCG group, while progression rate was 9.3% (4/43) in IAC + IVC group and 9.4% (5/53) in BCG group. Both of the recurrence and progression rate did not show a significant difference. In the Kaplan–Meier plot, no difference was found with respect to recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival. Moreover, 46.5% (20/43) patients suffered from adverse events of IAC and 83.1% (49/59) patients suffered from adverse events associated with BCG, of which 6 patients discontinued treatment due to serious adverse events of BCG. Univariate analysis suggested that only recurrent tumor could be an independent risk factor related to recurrence.ConclusionsIAC combined with IVC used in high-risk NMIBC could reduce the recurrence and progression as effective as BCG instillation with lower adverse events.",0
"ABSTRACTHepatic schistosomiasis is a neglected parasitosis that affects millions of people each year worldwide and leads to high healthcare costs and increased morbidity and mortality in infected humans. It is a disease that has been widely studied in terms of its pathophysiology; therefore, the signaling pathways that lead to liver damage, with the consequent development of liver fibrosis, are now better understood. Research has elucidated the role of soluble egg antigen in the development of hepatic granulomas and liver fibrosis, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and its participation in liver damage, the role of heat shock protein 47 and its involvement in liver fibrosis, the anti-inflammatory effects caused by interleukin-37, and the role of natural killer and natural killer T cells in the development of the disease. Hepatic schistosomiasis can range from simple hepatomegaly to the development of portal hypertension combined with hepatic fibrosis. For diagnostic purposes, a microscopic examination of excreta remains the gold standard; however, abdominal ultrasound has recently taken on an important role in the assessment of liver lesions produced by the parasite. Praziquantel is considered the management drug of choice, and has been associated with a potential preventive antifibrotic effect.","Monocytes have been traditionally classified in three discrete subsets, which can participate in the immune responses as effector cells or as precursors of myeloid-derived cells in circulation and tissues. However, recent advances in single-cell omics have revealed unprecedented phenotypic and functional heterogeneity that goes well beyond the three conventional monocytic subsets and propose a more fluid differentiation model. This novel concept does not only apply to the monocytes in circulation but also at the tissue site. Consequently, the binary model proposed for differentiating monocyte into M1 and M2 macrophages has been recently challenged by a spectrum model that more realistically mirrors the heterogeneous cues in inflammatory conditions. This review describes the latest results on the high dimensional characterization of monocytes and monocyte-derived myeloid cells in steady state and cancer. We discuss how environmental cues and monocyte-intrinsic properties may affect their differentiation toward specific functional and phenotypic subsets, the causes of monocyte expansion and reduction in cancer, their metabolic requirements, and the potential effect on tumor immunity.",1
"Purpose The efficacy and lower neurotoxicity of normal brain-sparing radiotherapy (NBS-RT) with systemic therapy in treating multiple brain metastases from non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is underexplored. This study compares whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and NBS-RT for multiple brain metastases in NSCLC, focusing on treatment outcomes and leukoencephalopathy.Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 503 patients with NSCLC with multiple brain metastases at a single center, treated with either WBRT or NBS-RT. Post-RT treatments included chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Main outcomes measured were intracranial control, overall survival (OS), and leukoencephalopathy incidence.Results In this study, 441 patients received WBRT and 62 received NBS-RT, with median ages of 62 and 61 years, respectively. A significant portion of both groups, 77.3% in WBRT and 80.6% in NBS-RT, received post-RT systemic therapy. The median number of brain metastases was 10 for WBRT and 12 for NBS-RT, with median maximal diameters of 11.7 mm in WBRT and 14.4 mm in NBS-RT. After a median follow-up of 10.9 months for WBRT and 11.8 months for NBS-RT, there were no significant differences in intracranial progression (p=0.516) or OS (p=0.492) between the groups. However, WBRT patients had a higher incidence of leukoencephalopathy than NBS-RT patients (p=0.013).Conclusion NBS-RT combined with systemic therapy was as effective in treating multiple brain metastases as WBRT and was less toxic. NBS-RT-based strategies deserve further investigation in a prospective setting.","PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for adrenal gland metastasis, with a focus on the assessment of the irradiated subjects’ endocrinological function.Materials and methodsA total of 36 patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2020 in this prospective phase II trial. Patients were treated with Linac-based SBRT, with a dose of 45 Gy in 3 consecutive fractions. Primary end-point was local control (LC) of the treated lesions and secondary end-points included evaluation of acute and late toxicity, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and the impact on the hormonal production of adrenal glands.ResultsWith a median follow-up of 9.5 months, LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 94.7% and 88.4%, respectively. Rates of PFS at 1 and 2 years were 50.5% and 29.8%, with a median PFS of 14.7 months. Rates of OS at 1 and 2 years were 62.9% and 44.1%. At univariate analysis, oligorecurrence was associated with better OS compared to oligoprogressive or synchronous metastatic disease. No grade 3 or greater toxicities were registered and only a minority of patients (22.2%) reported mild treatment-related side effects. Hormonal and electrolytes production was assessed before and after treatment, showing only a slight and transient variation within the reference ranges.ConclusionSBRT on adrenal metastases has been confirmed to be a feasible and effective treatment. With an excellent disease control and the preservation of the endocrine function, SBRT with ablative dose can be considered a viable alternative to more invasive approaches.",1
"Ferroptosis and immune response correlation studies have not been reported in prostate cancer (PCa), and the main goal of this paper is to identify biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Data on PCa were retrieved from the TCGA and MSKCC2010 databases. Thereafter, the differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DE-FRGs: ACSF2) and immune-related genes (DE-IRGs: ANGPT1, NPPC, and PTGDS) were identified using the “limma” package. Additionally, we used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to obtain biochemical relapse (BCR)-free survival-related genes and construct a risk signature. Patients with high-risk scores were characterized by poor BCR-free survival, relatively low immune cell abundance, and comparably weak expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Moreover, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was performed to explore the biological pathways related to the risk signature. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGESA) was applied to evaluate the status of immune cells in patients with PCa, which demonstrated that the risk score was intimately affiliated with immune response and cancer pathways. Ultimately, the connection between the risk score and response of PCa patients to immunotherapy was appraised using the TIDE algorithm. The TIDE algorithm implied that the high-risk score PCa population might benefit more from immunotherapy regimens. Finally, qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the expression of DE-FRGs and DE-IRGs in PCa cell and normal prostate epithelial cells. The result of qRT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of ACSF2, ANGPT1, NPPC, and PTGDS in normal prostate epithelial cell were higher than that in PCa cells. Therefore, a risk score model was generated based on one DE-FRG and three DE-IRGs, which could predict the BCR-free survival and response of immunotherapy for patients with PCa.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12033-024-01293-5.","BackgroundQingre huazhuo tang (QRHZT) is a traditional Chinese medicine decoction that has been used clinically by traditional Chinese medicine masters for more than 50 years with good results. However, its mechanism is unknown, and further elucidation is necessary.Aim of the studyTo verify the mechanism by which QRHZT regulates IgA nephropathy through immune checkpoints and ferroptosis by combining network pharmacology, single-cell sequencing and experimental studies.Materials and methodsThe single-cell sequencing data obtained from podocytes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) patients were screened, and the QRHZT target information was obtained from the ETCM database. Moreover, the KEGG, GSEA, immune checkpoint and ferroptosis data were analyzed and plotted using R language. Finally, the relevant immune checkpoint and ferroptosis targets were validated experimentally.ResultsQRHZT can regulate IgAN through the immune checkpoints FIT, FTH1, AKR1C3, and IL6 and the ferroptosis-related genes PVR and IFNG.ConclusionQRHZT has the potential to regulate IgAN, and omics strategies combined with network pharmacology is a feasible method for exploring the mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicines.",1
"BackgroundSkin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive disease with a poor prognosis for advanced tumors. Anoikis is a caspase-dependent cell death process triggered by extracellular matrix (ECM) detachment, rectifies detachment-induced metabolic defects that compromise cell survival, recent study revealed the crucial role of anoikis for cancer cells to survive during metastasis. However, limited research focused on the role of anoikis in SKCM.MethodsOur study utilized the 27 anoikis-related genes (ARGs) to divide SKCM patients into two clusters, and obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each cluster. These DEGs were used in stepwise Cox regression analysis to develop a prediction model for SKCM patients consisting of nine ARGs, called the anoikis-related signature (ARS). Subsequently, we used the risk scores calculated from the ARS to divide SKCM patients into two groups and explored differences in immune microenvironment, immune checkpoint reactivity, and drug sensitivity between the groups.ResultsNine ARGs were identified to stratify SKCM patients into two risk groups, patients in the high-risk group had a poor prognosis and suppressed immune cell infiltration. Moreover, higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules and a greater sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy drugs were observed in the low-risk group. Finally, all of the ARS hub genes were found to be upregulated in SKCM tissues and cell lines.ConclusionA novel ARGs signature was identified for predicting the prognosis of SKCM. Based on the immune landscape associated with ARS discovered in our study, targeting ARS hub genes may be a promising treatment for SKCM.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05468-6.","Head and neck cancers (HNC) are aggressive, difficult-to-treat tumors that can be caused by genetic factors but mainly by lifestyle or infection caused by the human papillomavirus. As the sixth most common malignancy, it presents a formidable therapeutic challenge with limited therapeutic modalities. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is appearing as a promising multitarget anticancer and antimetastatic agent. Numerous studies have shown that curcumin and its derivatives have the potential to affect signaling pathways (NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and EGFR) and molecular mechanisms that are crucial for the growth and migration of head and neck tumors. Furthermore, its ability to interact with the tumor microenvironment and trigger the immune system may significantly influence the organism’s immune response to the tumor. Combining curcumin with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy may improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the side effects of treatment, thereby increasing its therapeutic potential. This review is a comprehensive overview that discusses both the benefits and limitations of curcumin and its therapeutic effects in the context of tumor biology, with an emphasis on molecular mechanisms in the context of HNC. This review also includes possibilities to improve the limiting properties of curcumin both in terms of the development of new derivatives, formulations, or combinations with conventional therapies that have potential as a new type of therapy for the treatment of HNC and subsequent use in clinical practice.",0
"BackgroundAccording to current worldwide cancer data, Prostate Cancer (PC) ranks as the second most common type of cancer and is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality among men worldwide. PC in China has the 10th highest number of new cases and the 13th highest fatality rate, both of which show an ongoing annual increase. One of the significant challenges with prostate cancer is the difficulty in early detection, often resulting in diagnosis at intermediate or late stages, complicating treatment. Although hormonal therapy is initially successful in controlling the progression of prostate cancer, almost all tumors that respond to hormones eventually transform into Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) within 18-24 months of hormonal therapy. This poses clinical difficulties due to an absence of successful therapeutic approaches. Therefore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of prostate cancer development, identifying effective therapeutic targets, and discovering reliable molecular biomarkers are crucial objectives.MethodsCircRNA expression in plasma was assessed in 4 samples obtained from patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), and PC was detected through microarray probes. Statistical analysis of the expression of circDUSP22 and clinicopathological features was conducted. The investigation of target genes was conducted using luciferase reporter assays and bioinformatics analysis. The expression levels of circDUSP22, miR-18a-5p, and Solute Carrier Family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) were assessed using a quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Cell invasion, migration, colony formation, and proliferation were evaluated using Transwell, wound healing, colony formation, and CCK-8 assays, respectively. RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to examine the connections among circDUSP22, miR-18a-5p, and SLC7A11. The impact of circDUSP22 on the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins, specifically SLC7A11, as well as its effects on Fe2+ and ROS were also examined.ResultsIn both plasma samples and PCa cell lines, there was a substantial elevation of circDUSP22 and SLC7A11 expression and a decline in miR-18a-5p expression. Suppression of circDUSP22 significantly impeded the migration, invasion, and proliferation of PC cells in vitro. The target gene of miR-18a-5p, SLC7A11, was found to be upregulated as an effect of circDUSP22's competitive binding to miR-18a-5p. Cellular experiments demonstrated that interference with circDUSP22 expression in DU145 and PC-3 cells led to increased ferroptosis and decreased SLC7A11 expression. The modulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation was reversed by either overexpressing SLC7A11 or inhibiting miR-18a-5p in response to the silencing of circDUSP22.ConclusionThe circDUSP22 has been found to have a substantial effect on the development of ferroptosis in PC. It has been observed to influence the formation and evolution of this disorder by affecting the miR-18a-5p/SLC7A11 signaling pathway.","AbstractProstate cancer (PCa) has become a common disease among middle-aged and elderly men. The lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway plays a crucial role in the occurrence, development, invasion and metastasis of PCa and is therefore considered a new target for the prevention and treatment of PCa. 5-LOX and 12-LOX have a promoting effect on the occurrence, development, invasion and metastasis of PCa. 15-LOX-2 has an inhibitory effect on PCa. LOX inhibitors can effectively inhibit the metabolic activity of LOX. The research aims to review the mechanism of action and inhibitors of LOX in PCa, in order to provide relevant references for the prevention and treatment of PCa.",1
"Currently, cancer immunotherapy efficacy is measured by endpoints, such as progression-free survival and overall survival, that are unable to reflect authentic responses to checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials. Second progression-free survival, however, could be an ideal surrogate endpoint due to its easy measurability, correlation with overall survival, and ability to evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapies. This commentary summarizes second progression-free survival data from clinical trials investigating first-line anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors. We speculate that first-line immunotherapies exert a positive influence on the efficacy of later therapies in patients with a few cancer types, though additional research is urgently warranted.","Background:In this study, we compare outcomes of older patients with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (PCNSL) undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) with either thiotepa/carmustine (BCNU/Thio) or thiotepa/busulfan/cyclophosphamide (TBC) conditioning.Methods:We used a post-publication dataset made available by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Research (CIBMTR) including patients who were ≥65 years in age with PCNSL and underwent autoHCT as consolidation with TBC or BCNU/Thio conditioning.Results:Out of 147 patients; n=84 received BCNU/Thio and n=63 received TBC. The 1-year NRM in the BCNU/Thio group was 10% versus 22% in the TBC group (p=0.05) and the 2-year relapse rate was 5% versus 5%, respectively (p=1.00). The 2-year PFS in the BCNU/Thio group was 85% versus 71% in the TBC group (p=0.05) and 2-year OS was 86% vs 74% (p=0.08). In a multivariable regression model, BCNU/Thio was associated with a lower risk for NRM [Hazard Ratio (HR), 0.33, p=0.009], improved PFS (HR, 0.41, p=0.008) and OS (HR, 0.37, p=0.007), but there was no association with relapse risk.Conclusion:We found that in older adults with PCNSL undergoing consolidation with autoHCT, BCNU/Thio conditioning is associated with lower NRM and improved OS compared to TBC.",0
"BackgroundCuproptosis was defined as a novel nonapoptotic cell death pathway and its potential function in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear.MethodsWe obtained gene expression profiles, somatic mutation and corresponding clinical information of 881 ccRCC samples from 3 cohorts including the cancer genome atlas cohort, GSE29609 cohort and CheckMate 025 cohort. As described in the latest published article, we enrolled 16 genes as cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs). We explored the expression level, variants and copy number variation of the CRGs. Univariate and multi-variate regression were utilized to assess the prognostic significance of the CRGs. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to identify potential subgroup and gene set variation analysis was used to explore the potential biological functions. CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE algorithm and single sample gene set enrichment analysis were used to evaluate the tumor microenvironment. In vitro experiments including CCK-8, transwell and wound healing assays were utilized to explore the potential biological function of DLAT in ccRCC.ResultsWe found that except for CDKN2A, the CRGs were positively associated with patients’ OS. Cuproptosis cluster, cuproptosis gene cluster and cuproptosis score were established, respectively, and higher cuproptosis score was significantly associated with a worse OS in ccRCC (p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the cuproptosis-related nomogram at 1 year, 3 years, 5 years was 0.858, 0.821 and 0.78, respectively. In addition, we found that the cuproptosis score was positively associated with PDCD1, CTLA4 expression level, thus the cuproptosis score may also reflect the dysfunction of tumor infiltrating immune cells. In vitro experiments indicated that overexpression of DLAT could inhibited the migration and proliferation ability of ccRCC cells.ConclusionOur findings identify a novel cuproptosis-related signature and the cuproptosis characteristics may influence the anti-tumor immunity though complex regulating networks, and thus cuproptosis may play a role in developing novel therapeutic target of ccRCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05259-z.","Synthetic DNAzyme-based structures enable dynamic cell regulation. However, engineering an effective and targeted DNAzyme-based structure to perform customizable multistep regulation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we designed a membrane-anchored DNAzyme-based molecular machine to implement dynamic inter- and intracellular cascade regulation, which realizes efficient T-cell/cancer cell interactions and subsequent receptor mediated cancer cell uptake. Using CD8+ T-cells and HeLa cancer cells as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the designed DNAzyme-based molecular machine enables customized cascade regulation including  specific recognition between T-cells and cancer cells,  specific response and fluorescence sensing upon extracellular stimuli, and  cascade regulation including intercellular distance shortening, cell–cell communication, and intracellular delivery of anticancer drugs. Together, this work provides a promising pathway for customized cascade cell regulation based on a DNAzyme-based molecular machine, which enables enhanced cancer therapy by combining T-cell immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",0
"PurposeAging is closely related to the occurrence of many diseases, including cancer, and involves changes in the immune microenvironment. γδT cells are important components of resident lymphocytes in mucosal tissues. However, little is known about the effects that the aged lung has on γδT cells and their prognostic significance in non-small cell lung cancer.MethodsIn the current study, the expression of γδTCR and IL-17A was measured by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 168 patients with adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 144 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Furthermore, gene transcription patterns in LUAD and LUSC tumors and normal controls were extracted from TCGA and GTEx databases and were analyzed.ResultsHigh frequency of γδT cells was observed in patients with LUAD and LUSC, whereas the levels of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD56 + cells were decreased. Elevated γδT cells in tumors were mainly IL-17A-releasing γδT17 cells, which were found to be enriched in aged patients. High γδT cell levels positively corelated with the overall survival (OS) of patients, especially the 5-year OS in the elderly. Further analysis of gene transcription patterns indicated that increased expression of LTBR, HES1, RORC, CCR6, IL1, and IL23A may contribute to the transformation of the tumor microenvironment in a manner conducive to γδT17 cell development and differentiation. Finally, gene analysis between different age groups revealed that the expression of CCR6 and IL7 in LUAD, as well as Hes1, IL7, and IL23A in LUSC, were remarkably higher in elderly (age ≥ 60 years) than in younger individuals (age < 60 years).ConclusionOur findings suggest that intrinsic alterations in the aging lung lead to γδT17 cell enrichment, which subsequently may exert anti-tumor effects in the elderly.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03742-z.","BackgroundAccording to current worldwide cancer data, Prostate Cancer (PC) ranks as the second most common type of cancer and is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality among men worldwide.

RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to examine the connections among circDUSP22, miR-18a-5p, and SLC7A11. The impact of circDUSP22 on the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins, specifically SLC7A11, as well as its effects on Fe2+ and ROS were also examined.ResultsIn both plasma samples and PCa cell lines, there was a substantial elevation of circDUSP22 and SLC7A11 expression and a decline in miR-18a-5p expression. Suppression of circDUSP22 significantly impeded the migration, invasion, and proliferation of PC cells in vitro. The target gene of miR-18a-5p, SLC7A11, was found to be upregulated as an effect of circDUSP22's competitive binding to miR-18a-5p. Cellular experiments demonstrated that interference with circDUSP22 expression in DU145 and PC-3 cells led to increased ferroptosis and decreased SLC7A11 expression. The modulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation was reversed by either overexpressing SLC7A11 or inhibiting miR-18a-5p in response to the silencing of circDUSP22.ConclusionThe circDUSP22 has been found to have a substantial effect on the development of ferroptosis in PC. It has been observed to influence the formation and evolution of this disorder by affecting the miR-18a-5p/SLC7A11 signaling pathway.",0
"PurposeColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, and its incidence and mortality rates are increasing every year. The intestinal microbiota has been called the ""neglected organ"" and there is growing evidence that the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites can be used in combination with immunotherapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy to greatly enhance the treatment of colorectal cancer and to address some of the side effects and adverse effects of these therapies. Antibiotics have great potential to eliminate harmful microbiota, control infection, and reduce colorectal cancer side effects. However, the use of antibiotics has been a highly controversial issue, and numerous retrospective studies have shown that the use of antibiotics affects the effectiveness of treatment (especially immunotherapy). Understanding the bi-directional role of the gut microbiota and antibiotics will further enhance our research into the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.MethodsWe searched the ""PubMed"" database and selected the following keywords ""intestinal microbiota, antibiotics, treatment, prevention, colorectal cancer"". In this review, we discuss the role of the intestinal microbiota in immunotherapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, diagnosis, and prevention of CRC. We also conclude that the intestinal microbiota and antibiotics work together to promote the treatment of CRC through a bidirectional effect.ResultsWe found that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role in promoting immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, diagnosis and prevention of CRC. In addition, gut microbiota and antibiotic interactions could be a new strategy for CRC treatment.ConclusionThe bi-directional role of the intestinal microbiota and antibiotics plays a key role in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of colorectal cancer.","PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.",1
"PurposeThe study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological and molecular profiles associated with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in non-small cell lung cell (NSCLC) in a large-scale, multi-center, real-world Chinese cohort.MethodsA total of 6295 NSCLC specimens from six centers in China were analyzed by PD-L1 (22C3) assay. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (TCs) was classified as negative (TPS expression in < 1% of TCs), low (TPS in 1–49% of TCs), or high (TPS in ≥ 50% of TCs). The status of EGFR mutation was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing, and ALK and ROS1 translocation was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Associations of PD-L1 expression with clinicopathological features and driver mutations were analyzed.ResultsPositive PD-L1 expression was more frequently seen in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and other histological types of NSCLC compared to adenocarcinoma (AC). In AC, PD-L1 expression was associated with gender, histological type, metastatic status, and pathological features of lymphovascular invasion and visceral pleural invasion. Solid and micropapillary subtypes of AC were more likely to have positive PD-L1 expression compared to other subtypes. PD-L1 was more highly expressed in biopsy samples than in resected samples, and in metastatic samples compared with primary tissues. PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with wild-type EGFR and ALK translocations.ConclusionsPD-L1 expression in NSCLC is linked to histological type, pathological features, and driver mutation status, which has meaningful implications for clinical practice.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00432-020-03444-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Recombinant human type 5 adenovirus (H101) is an oncolytic virus used to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Owing to the deletion of the E1B-55kD and E3 regions, H101 is believed to selectively inhibit nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Whether H101 inhibits other type of tumors via different mechanisms remains unclear. In this study we investigated the effects of H101 on melanomas. We established B16F10 melanoma xenograft mouse model, and treated the mice with H101 (1 × 108 TCID50) via intratumoral injection for five consecutive days. We found that H101 treatment significantly inhibited B16F10 melanoma growth in the mice. H101 treatment significantly increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and reduced the proportion of M2-type macrophages. We demonstrated that H101 exhibited low cytotoxicity against B16F10 cells, but the endothelial cells were more sensitive to H101 treatment. H101 induced endothelial cell pyroptosis in a caspase-1/GSDMD-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of H101 with the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 antibody (10 mg/kg, i.p., every three days for three times) exerted synergic suppression on B16F10 tumor growth in the mice. This study demonstrates that, in addition to oncolysis, H101 inhibits melanoma growth by promoting anti-tumor immunity and inducing pyroptosis of vascular endothelial cells.",0
"BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.","IntoductionBladder cancer is the second most common urinary tract cancer. Above 70% of the occurrence of bladder cancer is superficial (pTis, pTa, and pT1), non-muscle invasive tumor (NMIBC), and the incidence of invasive disease is occasional. Treatments for NMIBC consist of transurethral resection (TUR) and subsequently intravesical immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), intending to prevent tumor progression and decrease recurrence. However, 20–30% of these tumors have progression, and 70% have a recurrence after exclusive TUR treatment. The immunomodulator of biological response, OncoTherad®, is an attractive potential to revolutionize cancer therapy. In our previous studies with mice, the results showed that treatment with OncoTherad® reduced 100% of tumor progression in NMIBC through the activation of Toll-Like Receptors’ non-canonical pathway.Materials and Methods In the present study, 36 female C57Bl/6J mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 6/group): Control, Cancer, Cancer + BCG, Cancer + OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1), Cancer + P14-16 and Cancer + CFI-1. NMIBC was chemically induced and the treatments were followed for 6 weeks. A week after the last dose of treatment, animals were euthanized, the bladder was collected and routinely processed for immunohistochemical analyses of RANK, RANKL, FOXP3, and PD-1/PD-L1, such as PD-1/PD-L1 western blotting.ConclusionThe immunohistochemical results showed that OncoTherad® reduced RANK and RANKL immunoreactivities compared to the cancer group, which indicates a good prognosis. Immunohistochemical and western blotting analyses confirmed that OncoTherad® modulated PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint.",1
"ABSTRACTBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, but they can induce immune-related adverse events, including immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonia (CIP), a severe lung complication. CIP, particularly Grades 3–4, is associated with poor prognosis, indicating a critical need for research on this issue. Our study aimed to investigate the risk factors and biomarkers associated with severe CIP in lung cancer patients treated with ICIs, where OS represents overall survival and PFS denotes progression-free survival.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 106 lung cancer patients with CIP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 2019 to 2023, categorized into four severity grades.ResultsThe median time to onset of CIP was 5.17 months. Patients with Grade 3–4 CIP had a median PFS of 6.5 months and OS of 11.2 months. Univariate analysis identified phosphocreatine kinase below 61.5 U/l, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) below 1.96, and BMI below 21.26 as predictive factors for Grades 3–4 CIP. Multivariate analysis confirmed that a decreased FVC was a significant predictor.ConclusionsA decreased FVC below 1.96 emerged as a predictive factor for Grades 3–4 CIP, highlighting the importance of monitoring FVC in patients receiving ICIs.","ABSTRACTTreatment of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) has evolved over the last decade. According to studies, the use of targeted therapies has significantly increased the life expectancy of patients. Moreover, ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have improved clinical outcomes. In Lebanon, translating recommendations into clinical practice remains challenging. A Lebanese expert panel of oncologists was convened to describe the management paradigm and the clinical evidence supporting the optimal use of next-generation TKIs in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC and to provide an expert overview of local challenges and recommendations for optimizing the management of advanced NSCLC in Lebanese patients. The experts agreed that these recommendations should be part of a healthcare strategy to be implemented at the national level.",1
"PurposeThe phenomenon of immunogenic cell death (ICD) is intricately linked to numerous antitumor treatments and exerts a profound regulatory function in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). We aimed to establish a prognostic signature from the ICD-related biomarkers to differentiate the TIME in hepatocellular carcinoma and predict diverse outcomes for patients with liver cancer.MethodsICD score-related genes (ICDSGs) were identified using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The ICD score-related signature (ICDSsig) was established by applying LASSO and Cox regression. Model precision was verified using the external datasets. We used independent prognostic variables in clinicopathologic factors to develop a nomogram. Further, clinical characteristics, immune and molecular landscapes, the responses of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and immunotherapy, and chemotherapy sensitivity were analyzed for high- and low-risk patients.ResultsICD score—calculated using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA)—displayed strong associations with the TIME in HCC. We identified 34 ICDSGs after integrating the TCGA and GSE104580 datasets. Then, three novel ICDSGs (DNASE1L3, KLRB1, and LILRB1) were screened out to construct the ICDSsig; the prognostic signature performed well in the external databases. The high-risk patients had worse outcomes owing to their advanced pathological state, non-response of TACE, and immune-cold phenotype in the immune landscapes. The immune checkpoint genes, N6-methyladenosine-relevant genes, and microsatellite instability score were increased in the high-risk subgroup, thereby indicating a favorable sensitivity to immunotherapy. Common chemotherapy drugs were more effective in high-risk patients due to low half-maximal inhibitory concentration values.ConclusionThe ICDSsig can potentially predict outcomes and therapeutic responses for patients with liver cancer and may assist clinicians in designing individualized treatment strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05017-1.","AbstractThis review highlights the significant role of nanodrug delivery systems (NDDS) in enhancing the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Focusing on the integration of NDDS with immune regulation strategies, it explores their transformative impacts on the tumor microenvironment and immune response dynamics. Key advancements include the optimization of drug delivery through NDDS, targeting mechanisms like immune checkpoint blockade and modulating the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Despite the progress, challenges such as limited clinical efficacy and complex manufacturing processes persist. The review emphasizes the need for further research to optimize these systems, potentially revolutionizing cancer treatment by improving delivery efficiency, reducing toxicity and overcoming immune resistance.",1
"Growing evidence implicates the immune system as a critical mediator of cardiovascular disease progression and a viable therapeutic target. Increased inflammatory cell activity is seen in the full spectrum of disorders from early-stage atherosclerosis through myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and chronic heart failure. Although therapeutic strategies to modulate inflammation have shown promise in preclinical animal models, efficacy in patients has been modest owing in part to the variable severity of inflammation across individuals. The diverse leukocyte subpopulations involved in different aspects of heart disease pose a challenge to effective therapy, wherein adverse and beneficial aspects of inflammation require appropriate balance. Noninvasive molecular imaging enables tissue-level interrogation of inflammatory cells in the heart and vasculature to provide mechanistic and temporal insights into disease progression. Although clinical imaging has relied on 18F-FDG as a nonselective and crude marker of inflammatory cell activity, new imaging probes targeting cell surface markers of different leukocyte subpopulations present the opportunity to visualize and quantify distinct phases of cardiac and vessel wall inflammation. Similarly, therapies are evolving to more effectively isolate adverse from beneficial cell populations. This parallel development of immunocardiology and molecular imaging provides the opportunity to refine treatments using imaging guidance, building toward mechanism-based precision medicine. Here, we discuss progress in molecular imaging of immune cells in cardiology from use of 18F-FDG in the past to the present expansion of the radiotracer arsenal and then to a future theranostic paradigm of tracer–therapy compound pairs with shared targets. We then highlight the critical experiments required to advance the field from preclinical concept to clinical reality.","Atherosclerosis is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases with a high global prevalence. It is characterized by the formation of lipid-laden plaques in the arteries, which eventually lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis. While the current lipid-lowering therapies are generally effective in lowering the risk of cardiovascular events, they do not address the underlying causes of disease. Defective resolution of inflammation and impaired efferocytosis are the main driving forces of atherosclerosis. Macrophages recognize cells for clearance by the expression of “eat me” and “do not eat me” signals, including the CD47-SIRPα axis. However, the “do not eat me” signal CD47 is overexpressed in atherosclerotic plaques, leading to compromised efferocytosis and secondary necrosis. In this context, prophagocytic antibodies have been explored to stimulate the clearance of apoptotic cells, but they are nonspecific and impact healthy tissues. In macrophages, downstream of signal regulatory protein α, lie protein tyrosine phosphatases, SHP 1/2, which can serve as effective targets for selectively phagocytosing apoptotic cells. While increasing the efferocytosis targets the end stages of lesion development, the underlying issue of inflammation still persists. Simultaneously increasing efferocytosis and reducing inflammation can be effective therapeutic strategies for managing atherosclerosis. For instance, IL-10 is a key anti-inflammatory mediator that enhances efferocytosis via phosphoSTAT3 (pSTAT3) activation. In this study, we developed a combination nanotherapy by encapsulating an SHP-1 inhibitor (NSC 87877) and IL-10 in a single nanoparticle platform [(S + IL)-NPs] to enhance efferocytosis and inflammation resolution. Our studies suggest that (S + IL)-NPs successfully encapsulated both agents, entered the macrophages, and delivered the agents into intracellular compartments. Additionally, (S + IL)-NPs decreased inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory markers and enhancing anti-inflammatory mediators. They also exhibited the potential for improved phagocytic activity via pSTAT3 activation. Our nanomedicine-mediated upregulation of the anti-inflammatory and efferocytic responses in macrophages shows promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",1
"ABSTRACTIntegrating nanotechnologies in diagnostic imaging presents a promising step forward compared to traditional methods, which carry certain limitations. Conventional imaging routes, such as X-ray/computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, derive significant advantages from nanoparticles (NPs), which allow researchers and clinicians to overcome some of the limitations of traditional imaging agents. In this literature review, we explore recent advancements in nanomaterials being applied in conventional diagnostic imaging techniques by exploring relevant reviews and original research papers (for example experimental models and theoretical model studies) in the literature. Collectively, there are numerous nanomaterials currently being examined for use in conventional imaging modalities, and each imaging technique has unique NPs with properties that can be manipulated to answer an array of clinical questions specific to that imaging modality. There are still challenges to consider, including getting regulatory approval for clinical research and routine use about long-term biocompatibility, which collectively emphasize the need for continued research to facilitate the integration of nanotechnology into routine clinical practice. Most importantly, there is a continued need for strong, collaborative efforts between researchers, biomedical engineers, clinicians, and industry stakeholders, which are necessary to bridge the persistent gap between translational ideas and implementation in clinical settings.","PurposesIncreased number of studies reveal the crucial role of the Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway in anti-tumor immunity. In this study, we aim to explore the effect of cGAS/STING on tumor immune microenvironment of melanoma after carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and the underlying mechanism.MethodsC57BL/6 mouse tumor models were used to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments (X-ray, carbon ion, PD-L1 inhibitor and combination therapies) on tumor growth and process. Mass cytometry was performed to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). DNA damage response (DDR) and cGAS/STING pathway were investigated by immunofluorescence-co-localization assays, γ-H2AX, P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), Breast Cancer 1 (BRCA1), and cGAS measurements.ResultsCarbon ion irradiation caused more DNA damages and cGAS–STING pathway activation compared with X-ray irradiation, and the former slowed the melanoma growth in syngeneic model. Although X-ray irradiation is not sensitive for melanoma treatment, carbon ion irradiation showed a significant anti-tumor effect for melanoma treatment. TILs analysis revealed that CIRT boosted the infiltration of natural killer (NK), CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, meanwhile increased the number of immune checkpoint (programmed death-1, PD-1, lymphocyte activation gene 3, LAG-3 and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3, TIM-3). Moreover, CIRT increased PD-L1 exposure on cell surface compared with X-ray group. Furthermore, CIRT combined with PD-L1 inhibitor therapy increased the number of T cells and NK cells in melanoma, and slowed the growth of melanoma compared with other therapies.ConclusionsOur findings showed that CIRT displayed biological effects by increasing DNA damages of tumor cells and improving immunity in melanoma, which indicated that CIRT might be a potential synergetic treatment for radiotherapy and radioimmunotherapy in melanoma patients. Our works put forward a new insight to provide an effective strategy for melanoma therapy. These findings may help in the design of strategies on melanoma in clinical studies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04577-6.",1
"ABSTRACTMillions of people worldwide suffer from cancer, facing challenges such as treatments affecting healthy cells, suboptimal responses, adverse effects, recurrence risk, drug resistance, and nonspecific targeting. Chemoresistance leads to fatalities, but phytoactives show promise in cancer management despite limitations such as high metabolism, poor absorption, and high dosage requirements. Challenges in the large-scale isolation of phytoactive compounds, solubility, bioavailability, and targeting limit their development. Recent developments, including carbohydrate, lipid, and protein-based nanoparticles, have enhanced cancer treatment by improving the bioavailability and targeted delivery of phytoactives such as polyphenols, alkaloids, sulfur-containing compounds, flavonoids, and terpenes. Despite advancements, clinical application faces hurdles such as poor bioavailability and inconsistent immune responses. This article discusses the promise of phytoactive-loaded nanoformulations in cancer management, highlighting targeted drug delivery, unmet needs, and challenges. Further research is needed to overcome these challenges and fully understand the potential of phytoactives in cancer management.","SUMMARYExtracellular 2’3’-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is an immunotransmitter exported by diseased cells and imported into host cells to activate the innate immune STING pathway. We previously identified SLC19A1 as a cGAMP importer, but its use across human cell lines is limited. Here, we identify LRRC8A heteromeric channels, better known as volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as widely-expressed cGAMP transporters. LRRC8A forms complexes with LRRC8C and/or LRRC8E, depending on their expression levels, to transport cGAMP and other 2’3’-cyclic dinucleotides. In contrast, LRRC8D inhibits cGAMP transport. We demonstrate that cGAMP is effluxed or influxed via LRRC8 channels, as dictated by the cGAMP electrochemical gradient. Activation of LRRC8A channels, which can occur under diverse stresses, strongly potentiates cGAMP transport. We identify activator sphingosine 1-phosphate and inhibitor DCPIB as chemical tools to manipulate channel-mediated cGAMP transport. Finally, LRRC8A channels are key cGAMP transporters in resting primary human vasculature cells and universal human cGAMP transporters when activated.",0
"ABSTRACTThe release of active agents in tumors rather than normal tissues, limits systemic exposure and toxicities. Targeting over-expressed esterase enzyme in the tumor microenvironment can selectively release immune-active agents like Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand inhibitors from ester-sensitive lipid nanocarriers, offering a novel approach compared with conventional therapies. PD-1 and PD-L1 association cause T-cell inactivation, whereas blocking their association improves their cytotoxic mechanism. The patent application US2022/0080051-A1 discloses a novel immune-active agent conjugated with lipid to form a nanocarrier for esterase-sensitive release. These nanocarriers selectively enter leaky vasculature of tumors through enhanced permeability and retention effect, undergo ester cleavage to release agents, and are reported to increase bioavailability by 24 times. Further, with other agents or alone it achieves targeted synergistic cancer therapy. Also, the current patent spotlight delves into the crucial formulation considerations necessary for obtaining successful approval of lipidic nano products from relevant regulatory authorities.","PurposeThis phase II trial is designed to test whether the performance status (PS) of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients (pts) can improve with chemotherapy if their poor PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of ≥ 2) is due to disease burden rather than comorbidities.MethodsAge18–65 years, Charlson’s comorbidity index < 9, serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dl, adequate bone marrow and organ function, & ECOG PS ≥ 2 as judged by the worst score of three independent physicians were administered 3 doses of weekly paclitaxel at 60 mg/m2/dose. The primary endpoint was an improvement in ECOG PS by 1 point at 4 weeks; others: toxicity (CTCAE v 5.0), quality of life (QoL) assessment at baseline and 4 weeks by EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13. Optimal Simon’s 2-stage design was used.Results Forty-six patients were included with a median age of 56 years (interquartile range, IQR 54–59), 12 (26%) had comorbid conditions, and 87% with ECOG PS 3/4. PS improved in 11 pts at 4 weeks and in 7 beyond this time point. Grade 3/4 toxicities are seen in 20% (most common: anemia and diarrhea). At a median follow-up of 4.8 m (95% CI 3.27–14.9), the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.3 months (95% CI 2.36–5.6) and 6.8 months (95% CI 2.47–8.8), respectively. QoL improved for global QoL, role functioning, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, pain in the chest, pain in other parts, and worsened for alopecia and sore mouth.Conclusions Abbreviated chemotherapy is a useful, well-tolerated strategy in carefully selected poor PS mNSCLC patients that can improve PS and QoL.Clinical trialClinical trial information: CTRI/2020/01/022617.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04617-1.",0
"AbstractIntroductionThe phase 3 LEAP-002 study (NCT03713593) of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggested improved antitumor activity of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus lenvatinib alone with manageable safety, although overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) did not reach prespecified statistical significance. This post hoc analysis assessed efficacy and safety in Japanese patients.MethodsPatients with advanced HCC without prior systemic treatment were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 8 mg (body weight <60 kg) or 12 mg (body weight ≥60 kg) oral lenvatinib once daily plus 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Dual primary end points were OS and PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary end points were objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and time to progression per RECIST v1.1 by BICR and safety.ResultsOverall, 80 patients were enrolled in Japan (lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, n = 39; lenvatinib plus placebo, n = 41). Median time from randomization to database cutoff (June 21, 2022) was 34.1 months (range: 26.9–39.6). Median OS was 31.4 months (95% CI: 21.2– not reached) for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 21.4 months (95% CI: 14.4–25.4) for lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [95% CI: 0.31–0.96]). Median PFS for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was 10.4 months (95% CI: 6.2–18.5) and 6.5 months (95% CI: 6.0–8.3) for lenvatinib plus placebo (HR = 0.54 [95% CI: 0.32–0.90]). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 26 patients (67%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 24 patients (59%) in the lenvatinib plus placebo group.ConclusionIn Japanese patients enrolled in LEAP-002, findings were consistent with the global population where OS and PFS trended toward improvement; a similar safety profile was observed.","PurposeThe purpose of this study is to compare response rates of lenvatinib and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, in first-line real-world setting.MethodsOverall cohort included Western and Eastern hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient populations from 46 centres in 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Japan, and Republic of Korea).Results1312 patients were treated with lenvatinib, and 823 patients were treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Objective response rate (ORR) was 38.6% for patients receiving lenvatinib, and 27.3% for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p < 0.01; odds ratio 0.60). For patients who achieved complete response (CR), overall survival (OS) was not reached in both arms, but the result from univariate Cox regression model showed 62% reduction of death risk for patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p = 0.05). In all multivariate analyses, treatment arm was not found to be an independent factor conditioning OS. Comparing ORR achieved in the two arms, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in all subgroups except for Eastern patients, Child–Pugh B patients, presence of portal vein thrombosis, α-feto-protein ≥ 400 ng/mL, presence of extrahepatic disease, albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2, and no previous locoregional procedures.ConclusionLenvatinib achieves higher ORR in all patient subgroups. Patients who achieve CR with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab can achieve OS so far never recorded in HCC patients. This study did not highlight any factors that could identify patient subgroups capable of obtaining CR.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04512-1.",1
"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common digestive tumor, and we aimed to develop and validate nomogram models, predicting the overall survival (OS) of young and middle-aged male patients with HCC.MethodsWe extracted eligible data from relevant patients between 2000 and 2017 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. In addition, randomly divided all patients into two groups (training and validation = 7:3). The nomogram was established using effective risk factors based on univariate and multivariate analysis. The area under the time-dependent curve, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the effective performance of the nomogram. The risk stratifications of the nomogram and the AJCC criteria‐based tumor stage were compared.Results11 variables were selected by univariate and multivariate analysis to establish the nomogram of HCC. The AUC values of 3, 4, and 5 years of the time–ROC curve are 0.858, 0.862 and 0.859 for the training cohort, and 0.858, 0.877 and 0.869 for the validation cohort, respectively, indicating that the nomogram has a good ability of discrimination. The calibration plots showed favorable consistency between the prediction of the nomogram and actual observations in both the training and validation cohorts. In addition, the decision curve DCA showed that the nomogram was clinically useful and had better discriminative ability to recognize patients at high risk than the AJCC criteria‐based tumor stage.ConclusionPrognostic nomogram of young and middle-aged male patients with HCC was developed and validated to help clinicians evaluate the prognosis of patients.","AbstractThe advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented potential for the targeted manipulation of DNA sequences.

Here, we describe critical areas of discussion such as immunogenicity, emphasizing the importance of safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the context of treating single-mutation genetic diseases using advanced editing techniques genetics as prime editor and base editor. The text discusses the versatility of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) in forming complexes for delivering biomolecules, particularly ribonucleoprotein for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells. In addition, it emphasizes the promise of combining CPPs with DNA base editing and prime editing systems. These systems, known for their simplicity and precision, hold great potential for correcting point mutations in human genetic diseases. In summary, the text provides a clear overview of the advantages of using CPPs for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9, particularly in conjunction with advanced editing systems, highlighting their potential impact on clinical applications in the treatment of single-mutation genetic diseases.",0
"Objective:Recent advances in Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease (RDD), notably molecular testing, targeted therapy, and PET-CT imaging, hold promise for better recognition and improved outcomes. This study presents patients diagnosed and treated in a “real world” setting, where navigating limited resources must be considered.Methods:This retrospective single-center review includes 15 adult patients diagnosed with RDD at Vancouver General Hospital between November 2015 and October 2023.Results:The cohort comprised five males and ten females with a median age 53 years (range 19–80 years). All 15 patients had extra-nodal disease; 11 patients exclusively had extra-nodal disease, and four patients also had lymph node involvement. Seven patients had tissue next-generation sequencing, identifying MAP2K1 mutations in four cases and a KRAS p.K117N mutation in one case that was treated with targeted therapy using trametinib. PET-CT was used for disease staging in four cases. Six patients with refractory disease tolerated lenalidomide and dexamethasone without significant toxicity; three patients achieved complete response, and three had partial response.Conclusion:This study highlights RDD’s diverse extra-nodal manifestations. Lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for select patients, especially those with refractory disease. Broad utilization of NGS and PET-CT can positively influence management decisions.","Aim: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors (VEGFRIs) have been common used for recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC), but insufficient high-level evidence on verifying its efficacy and safety.Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched under eight electronic databases. Stata 14.0 and Review Manager 5.3 were used for data analysis. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE profiler. This systematic review (SR) was registered under INPLASY (INPLASY202120019).Conclusion: Totally 23 RCTs involving 2810 patients were included in this SR. Current evidence revealed that VEGFRIs had better efficacy, survival and quality of life in the treatment of ROC. Though VEGFRIs increase some drug-related adverse events (AEs), all the AEs could be manageable in the clinical practice.",0
"PurposeForkhead Box Protein 3 (FoxP3) is known as a key mediator in the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The aim of our study was to investigate whether FoxP3-positive Tregs have the potential to act as an independent predictor in progression as well as in regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, especially in patients with intermediate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II).MethodsNuclear FoxP3 expression was immunohistochemically analysed in 169 patient samples (CIN I, CIN II with regressive course, CIN II with progressive course, CIN III). The median numbers were calculated for each slide and correlated with the histological CIN grade. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 26 (Mann–Whitney U test, Spearman’s rank correlation).ResultsAn increased FoxP3 expression in CIN II with progression could be detected in comparison to CIN II with regression (p = 0.003). Total FoxP3 expression (epithelium and dysplasia-connected stroma) was higher in more advanced CIN grades (p < 0.001 for CIN I vs. CIN II; p = 0.227 for CIN II vs. CIN III). A positive correlation could be detected between FoxP3-positive cells in epithelium and total FoxP3 expression (Spearman’s Rho: 0,565; p < 0.01).ConclusionExpression of FoxP3 could be a helpful predictive factor to assess the risks of CIN II progression. As a prognosticator for regression and progression in cervical intraepithelial lesions it might thereby help in the decision process regarding surgical treatment vs. watchful waiting strategy to prevent conisation-associated risks for patients in child-bearing age. In addition, the findings support the potential of Tregs as a target for immune therapy in cervical cancer patients.","Despite significant advancement in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of breast carcinoma, the prognosis remains dismal. Recently, with advances in its understanding, various immune system-based management strategies have been developed. CTLA-4 suppresses lymphocyte reactivity, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2 receptor expression and triggers cell cycle arrest. PD-L1 inhibits the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibits release of cytokines. Hence, we planned to evaluate the immunoexpression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in invasive ductal carcinoma breast and seek correlation between their immunopositivity and the clinicopathological parameters. This was a retrospective study conducted on archival material of 50 cases of breast carcinoma tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological details were recorded. All cases were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Cytoplasmic expression of CTLA-4 and membranous expression of PD-L1 were considered positive and staining intensity was recorded as mild, moderate, and intense. Data was recorded and analyzed. Immunopositivity for CTLA-4 was seen in 92% of cases of breast carcinoma. CTLA-4 staining intensity showed significant association with TNM staging of breast carcinomas (p = 0.036). Age group of the breast carcinoma cases showed a statistically significant correlation with PD-L1 immunoexpression (p = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between all other clinicopathological characteristics and CTLA-4 or PD-L1 immunostaining. Our study shows that CTLA-4 is a more important immune checkpoint regulator in breast carcinomas in comparison to PD-L1. Thus, anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy might prove to be of immense help in the treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma breast showing overexpression of CTLA-4.",0
"IntroductionPoliovirus receptor (PVR) is a tumor promoter and a regulatory checkpoint that enhances immunosuppression. We investigated PVR expression by applying immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A positive association existed between PVR expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) expression in patients with surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PVR expression is a prognosis predictor of lung adenocarcinoma.PurposeTo investigate the prognostic significance of PVR expression and CTLA4 expression for surgically resected NSCLC.Patients and methodsThe medical records of 108 Chinese patients with primary NSCLC who underwent surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of PVR and CTLA4 were measured through IHC. Clinical characteristics, the association between PVR and CTLA4, and the prognostic significance of PVR were analyzed.ResultsA significant positive association was observed between PVR and CTLA4 expression in NSCLC (P = 0.016). PVR had a high positive rate among females, nonsmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma and advanced lung cancer. The overall survival (OS) of patients with negative PVR expression was significantly longer than that of patients with positive PVR expression (P = 0.049), especially among females (P = 0.03) and nonsmokers (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis results showed that advanced tumor stage and PVR expression were independent prognosis predictors of poor OS.ConclusionPVR can potentially serve as a prognostic predictor and biomarker for NSCLC and cancer anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03189-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeWe aimed to investigate the prognostic value of multiple immune cell markers including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and poliovirus receptor (PVR) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using archival tumor tissuesMethodsPatients diagnosed with HNSCC who have undergone surgical resection in 2005–2012 were included. Correlations between PVR and PD-L1 expression and patient characteristics were analyzed by analysis of variance. The Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test were used to estimate survival. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsIn total, 375 primary tumor tissues were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. High PVR expression was associated with a poor prognosis in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and tumors with high PVR expression were associated with a short OS. PD-L1 tumor expression did not have a prognostic impact on survival. Univariate analysis revealed that OS and RFS were affected by age and p16 and PVR expression; multivariate analysis revealed that age and p16 and PVR expression were the most important determinants of RFS.ConclusionPVR overexpression is a poor prognostic factor in patients with HNSCC and co-targeting PVR and PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic option that needs further investigation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03531-8.",1
"Background:Non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC) accounts for ≤20% of RCC cases. Lenvatinib (a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in combination with everolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) is approved for the treatment of advanced RCC after one prior antiangiogenic therapy.Objective:To determine the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib plus everolimus as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced nccRCC.Design, setting, and participants:This open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study enrolled patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic nccRCC and no prior anticancer therapy for advanced disease.Intervention:Lenvatinib (18 mg) plus everolimus (5 mg) orally once daily.Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety assessments. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ORRs were calculated using the two-sided Clopper-Pearson method. Median PFS and median OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and their 95% CIs were estimated via a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method.Results and limitations:The study (start date: February 20, 2017) enrolled 31 patients with nccRCC (papillary, n = 20; chromophobe, n = 9; unclassified, n = 2). At the data cutoff date (July 17, 2019), the best overall response was a partial response (eight patients: papillary, n = 3; chromophobe, n = 4; unclassified, n = 1) for an overall ORR of 26% (95% CI 12–45). Median PFS was 9.2 mo (95% CI 5.5–not estimable), and median OS was 15.6 mo (95% CI 9.2–not estimable). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue (71%), diarrhea (58%), decreased appetite (55%), nausea (55%), and vomiting (52%). Limitations include the small sample size and single-arm design.Conclusions:Lenvatinib plus everolimus showed promising anticancer activity in patients with advanced nccRCC with an ORR of 26% and is worthy of further study. The safety profile was consistent with the established profile of the study-drug combination.Patient summary:We examined the combination of lenvatinib plus everolimus as the first therapy for 31 patients who had advanced nccRCC. We found that this treatment seemed effective, because most patients had a decrease in tumor size and manageable treatment-related side effects.Clinical registration:This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.Gov as NCT02915783.","PurposeThe purpose of this study is to compare response rates of lenvatinib and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, in first-line real-world setting.MethodsOverall cohort included Western and Eastern hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient populations from 46 centres in 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Japan, and Republic of Korea).Results1312 patients were treated with lenvatinib, and 823 patients were treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Objective response rate (ORR) was 38.6% for patients receiving lenvatinib, and 27.3% for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p < 0.01; odds ratio 0.60). For patients who achieved complete response (CR), overall survival (OS) was not reached in both arms, but the result from univariate Cox regression model showed 62% reduction of death risk for patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p = 0.05). In all multivariate analyses, treatment arm was not found to be an independent factor conditioning OS. Comparing ORR achieved in the two arms, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in all subgroups except for Eastern patients, Child–Pugh B patients, presence of portal vein thrombosis, α-feto-protein ≥ 400 ng/mL, presence of extrahepatic disease, albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2, and no previous locoregional procedures.ConclusionLenvatinib achieves higher ORR in all patient subgroups. Patients who achieve CR with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab can achieve OS so far never recorded in HCC patients. This study did not highlight any factors that could identify patient subgroups capable of obtaining CR.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04512-1.",1
"BackgroundThe tumor suppressor gene AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) and systemic inflammatory response (SIR) have been reported to be related to the sensitivity to immunotherapy. This study intended to explore the relationship between ARID1A expression and SIR, and to further elucidate the prognostic value of ARID1A expression in gastric cancer (GC).MethodsThe mRNA and protein expression of ARID1A were detected in 272 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues. The data of nine systemic inflammation markers were collected 1 week before gastrectomy. Univariate and multivariate COX analysis were used to screen out independent predictors of GC.ResultsNegative expression of ARID1A protein was related to GC with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) (p = 0.033), positive programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (p = 0.005) and lower albumin level (p = 0.0064). Low expression of ARID1A mRNA was common in GC with abnormal E-cadherin (p = 0.020) and a higher platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (p = 0.0391). Multivariate COX analysis showed that the expression of ARID1A protein (p = 0.023), age (p = 0.004), T stage (p = 0.009) and N stage (p = 0.009) were independent predictors of GC. The nomogram established by independent predictors can accurately evaluate the survival risk of patients with GC.ConclusionsThe loss of ARID1A protein expression was associated with the dMMR subtype and high expression of PD-L1 in GC. Negative ARID1A protein and low expression of mRNA were associated with aberrant systemic inflammatory markers. The expression of ARID1A protein had important prognostic significance in GC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03971-w.","AbstractObjectivesUrothelial carcinomas (UCs) encompass a heterogeneous group of tumors. Several histopathologic features are associated with poor clinical outcomes and limited treatment options. With new rising therapeutic modalities, we aimed to determine the pattern of expression of Trop-2 and ephrin B2 in UC with aggressive subtype histology and/or divergent differentiation (SH/DD).MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of 113 UC samples with SH/DD at our institution from 2011 to 2021. Immunohistochemical staining for Trop-2 and ephrin B2 expression was performed on all cases. Expression was determined by the percentage of samples with a moderate or strong H-score.ResultsOur results show Trop-2 expression was the highest in squamous cell carcinoma and UC with squamous differentiation, adenocarcinoma and UC with glandular differentiation, and plasmacytoid subtype, while ephrin B2 expression was highest in adenocarcinoma, UC with glandular differentiation, and small cell carcinoma.ConclusionsExpression of Trop-2 and ephrin B2 may demonstrate therapeutic possibilities for patients with SH/DD, who usually have limited treatment options, particularly in small cell carcinoma, in which few targets have been identified. Clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of these novel treatments are warranted.",0
"BackgroundThe incidence of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), one of the most aggressive and lethal skin tumors, is increasing worldwide. However, for advanced SKCM, we still lack an accurate and valid way to predict its prognosis, as well as novel theories to guide the planning of treatment options for SKCM patients. Lactylation (LAC), a novel post-translational modification of histones, has been shown to promote tumor growth and inhibit the antitumor response of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a variety of ways. We hope that this study will provide new ideas for treatment options for SKCM patients, as well as research on the molecular mechanisms of SKCM pathogenesis and development.MethodsAt the level of the RNA sequencing set (TCGA, GTEx), we used differential expression analysis, LASSO regression analysis, and multifactor Cox regression analysis to screen for prognosis-related genes and calculate the corresponding LAC scores. The content of TME cells in the tumor tissue was calculated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and the TME score was calculated based on its results. Finally, the LAC–TME classifier was established and further analyzed based on the two scores, including the construction of a prognostic model, analysis of clinicopathological characteristics, and correlation analysis of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immunotherapy. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, this study analyzed the cellular composition in SKCM tissues and explored the role of LAC scores in intercellular communication. To validate the functionality of the pivotal gene CLPB in the model, cellular experiments were ultimately executed.ResultsWe screened a total of six prognosis-related genes (NDUFA10, NDUFA13, CLPB, RRM2B, HPDL, NARS2) and 7 TME cells with good prognosis. According to Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, we found that the LAClow/TMEhigh group had the highest overall survival (OS) and the LAChigh/TMElow group had the lowest OS (p value < 0.05). In further analysis of immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME), functional enrichment, tumor mutational load and immunotherapy, we found that immunotherapy was more appropriate in the LAClow/TMEhigh group. Moreover, the cellular assays exhibited substantial reductions in proliferation, migration, and invasive potentials of melanoma cells in both A375 and A2058 cell lines upon CLPB knockdown.ConclusionsThe prognostic model using the combined LAC score and TME score was able to predict the prognosis of SKCM patients more consistently, and the LAC–TME classifier was able to significantly differentiate the prognosis of SKCM patients across multiple clinicopathological features. The LAC–TME classifier has an important role in the development of immunotherapy regimens for SKCM patients.","BackgroundAn increasing number of studies indicated that metabolic reprogramming of amino acid metabolism may either promote or inhibit tumor progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of a gene risk signature associated with amino acid metabolism to predict the prognosis and immune characteristics of invasive breast carcinoma.MethodsLASSO Cox regression analysis was performed to construct and validate the prognostic risk signature based on the expression of 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes. The predictive value of the signature, immune characteristics, and chemotherapeutic drugs was also predicted. Finally, 9 significant genes were examined in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, and the predicted chemotherapeutic drugs were also verified.ResultsThe prognosis of the low-risk group was better than that of the high-risk group. The areas under the curve (AUCs) at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.852, 0.790, and 0.736, respectively. In addition, the GSEA results for KEGG and GO revealed that samples with a high-risk score exhibited a variety of highly malignant manifestations. The high-risk group was characterized by an increased number of M2 macrophages, a high level of tumor purity, low levels of APC co-stimulation, cytolytic activity, HLA, para-inflammation, and type I IFN response. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed that MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells express 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes differently. In addition, cell experiments were conducted to examine the effect of cephaeline-induced on cell viability, migration ability, and protein expression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and HIF-1α.ConclusionWe established a risk signature based on 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes for invasive breast carcinoma. Further analyses revealed that this risk signature is superior to other clinical indexes in survival prediction and that the subgroups identified by the risk signature exhibit distinct immune characteristics. Cephaeline was determined to be a superior option for patients in high-risk groups.",1
"IntroductionInduction intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) followed by maintenance after transurethral resection of bladder tumor, is the standard adjuvant therapy for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). There is sparse evidence on the practice of intravesical BCG in Australia. Our aim was to determine the outcomes of intravesical BCG therapy in NMIBC in Southwestern Sydney.MethodsThis was a multi-center retrospective audit of NMIBC patients who received intravesical BCG between January 2008 and June 2020. Data was collected across six tertiary hospitals in South Western Sydney. Primary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), BCG induction and maintenance rates.ResultsOf the 200 eligible patients over 12.5 years, median age was 77 years and 83% were male. Of these, 55%, 4.5%, 35% and 5% were Tis, Ta, T1 and unknown stage, respectively. All patients received induction BCG and 56% received maintenance BCG (range 3-36 months). Completion rate of induction BCG was 91%. Only 9% ceased treatment due to intolerance. The median duration of cystoscopy follow-up was 17 months. After a median follow-up time of 37 months, 55% developed recurrence (29% non-muscle invasive, 32% muscle-invasive disease, 8% distant metastasis). The 1-year and 5-year DFS rates were 72% and 41% (median DFS: 39 months). The 1-year and 5-year OS rates were 98% and 87% (median OS: not reached).ConclusionThe DFS and OS rates were comparable to previous literature. This provides real-world data to assist future clinical trials in NMIBC.","IntroductionThe urinary microbiome (UMB) includes living bacteria, their genomes, and their products from interactions with the host environment. A “core” UMB could potentially exist, with variations between age and sex groups. Changes in UMB composition have been associated with benign urological disorders, but also with urologic cancers. Mechanisms through which UMB can trigger and maintain cancer can be local inflammation and interaction with immune system.Aim of the studyTo describe the association between UMB and development of urologic cancers.MethodsA non-systematic literature review identified recently published studies (last 5 years), involving human patients, dealing with UMB. The database used for this review was PubMed, and the identified studies served as the base for a narrative analysis of the literature that explored the potential associations between UMB and urological cancers.ResultsIn bladder cancer (BC), UMB may play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (and thus to progression to metastasis), as well as in effectiveness of BCG response rate. BC is also associated with changes in UMB, with bacterial richness indices increased in cancer groups compared to non-neoplastic groups and being different between NMIBC vs MIBC patients. In prostate cancer (PCa), there is an abundance in proinflammatory bacteria and uropathogens. In regard to renal cell carcinoma (RCC), penile cancer and testicular cancer there are still too few studies to draw significant conclusions about its relationship with the UMB.ConclusionsGaining a deeper understanding of UMB role in urologic tumors could aid in the development of new therapies and improve classification of patients’ risk.",1
"AbstractBackgroundSex differences in adult diffuse glioma (ADG) are well established clinically, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Here, we aim to reveal molecular features and cellular compositions unique to each sex in ADG to comprehend the role of sex in disease etiology.MethodsWe quantified sex differences in the transcriptome of ADG using multiple independent glioma patient datasets. Next, we delved into the single-cell landscape to examine sex differences in gene expression and cellular composition. To explore how sex influences disease progression, we analyzed paired samples from primary and recurrent ADG cases, aiming to identify sex-specific differences in molecular and cellular features.ResultsOur analysis revealed that mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes and the tumor microenvironment emerged as primary influencers of sex-differential molecular enrichments. In IDHwt tumors, genes in the neuronal signaling pathway are found to be enriched in male tumors, while genes in hypoxia and inflammatory response pathways are enriched in female tumors. This pattern was reversed in IDHmut gliomas. We hypothesized that these distinctions could be attributed to heterogeneous cellular composition between sexes. Using single-cell data, we observed distinctive patterns of sex differences in cell states, cell composition, and cell–cell interaction in IDHwt and IDHmut tumors separately. Further, by comparing molecular changes in paired primary and recurrent ADG samples, we identified sex-specific differences in molecular characteristics and cellular compositions of recurrent tumors.ConclusionsOur results provide a comprehensive multilevel characterization of sex differences in ADG; such findings provide novel insights into glioma disease progression in each sex.","AbstractAdiponectin is an abundantly secreted hormone that communicates information between the adipose tissue, and the immune and cardiovascular systems. In metabolically healthy individuals, adiponectin is usually found at high levels and helps improve insulin responsiveness of peripheral tissues, glucose tolerance, and fatty acid oxidation. Beyond its metabolic functions in insulin-sensitive tissues, adiponectin plays a prominent role in attenuating the development of atherosclerotic plaques, partially through regulating macrophage-mediated responses. In this context, adiponectin binds to its receptors, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and AdipoR2 on the cell surface of macrophages to activate a downstream signaling cascade and induce specific atheroprotective functions. Notably, macrophages modulate the stability of the plaque through their ability to switch between proinflammatory responders, and anti-inflammatory proresolving mediators. Traditionally, the extremes of the macrophage polarization spectrum span from M1 proinflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Previous evidence has demonstrated that the adiponectin-AdipoR pathway influences M1-M2 macrophage polarization; adiponectin promotes a shift toward an M2-like state, whereas AdipoR1- and AdipoR2-specific contributions are more nuanced. To explore these concepts in depth, we discuss in this review the effect of adiponectin and AdipoR1/R2 on 1) metabolic and immune responses, and 2) M1-M2 macrophage polarization, including their ability to attenuate atherosclerotic plaque inflammation, and their potential as therapeutic targets for clinical applications.",1
"BackgroundGliomas are the most common highly aggressive primary malignant brain tumors in adults with different biological behaviors and clinically heterogeneous features. About the extremely poor prognosis of gliomas, the search for potential therapeutic modalities and targets is crucial.MethodWe extracted the anoikis-related genes (ARG) from GeneCards and obtained differentially expressed genes in normal and glioma tissues from the GSE4290 dataset to obtain intersect differentially expressed ARG in gliomas by differential analysis. KEGG and GO analyses were used to evaluate the potential pathways and molecular processes of these genes. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training cohort, we performed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and Cox regression to construct an ARG prognostic model and validated them in the TCGA testing cohort and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) validation cohort. Subsequently, we further explored the differences in clinical characteristics, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and the immune microenvironment in the high- and low-risk groups. Univariate and multifactorial regression analyses and nomogram construction were also performed. Moreover, we evaluated the expression levels of key genes via public databases, qPCR analysis and IHC staining, and further assessed the clinical prognostic value.ResultsThe regulatory model based on quantitative ARG prognostic models showed that patients in the high-risk group were associated with poorer survival prognosis, poorer clinical characteristics, and higher TMB levels. Moreover, the high-risk group had high levels of immune infiltration and upregulated immune checkpoint gene expression. The ARG prognostic model and the Nomogram showed good predictive performance. Expression and survival analysis of five prognostic ARG signatures (ETV4, HMOX1, MYC, NFE2L2, and UBE2C) showed that these genes have potential prognostic value.ConclusionOur constructed ARG prognostic risk model provides a potential therapeutic target and theoretical basis for predicting the prognosis of glioma patients and guiding individualized immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05138-7.","PurposeWe aimed to study the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) using bioinformatics.MethodsGSE39582 and GSE39084, which collectively contain 363 CRC samples, were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database as a test set. TCGA-COADREAD, with 376 CRC samples, was downloaded from the UCSC database as a validation set. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for ARGs that were significantly associated with prognosis. The top 10 ARGs were used to classify the samples into different subtypes based on unsupervised cluster analysis. The immune environments of the different subtypes were analyzed. ARGs that were significantly associated with CRC prognosis were used to construct a risk model. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen independent prognostic factors and construct a nomogram.ResultsFour anoikis-related subtypes (ARSs) with differential prognoses and immune microenvironments were identified. KRAS and epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathways were enriched in subtype B, which had the worst prognosis. Three ARGs (DLG1, AKT3, and LPAR1) were used to construct the risk model. Both the test and validation sets showed worse outcomes for patients in the high-risk group than those in the low-risk group. Risk score was found to be an independent prognostic factor for CRC. Moreover, there was a difference in drug sensitivity between the high- and low-risk groups.ConclusionThe identified ARGs and risk scores were associated with CRC prognosis and could predict the responses of patients with CRC to immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04945-2.",1
"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:DNA methylation patterns are highly rearranged in HCCs. However, diverse sources of variation are intermingled in cancer methylomes, precluding the precise characterization of underlying molecular mechanisms. We developed a computational framework (methylation signature analysis with independent component analysis [MethICA]) leveraging independent component analysis to disentangle the diverse processes contributing to DNA methylation changes in tumors.APPROACH AND RESULTS:Applied to a collection of 738 HCCs, MethICA unraveled 13 stable methylation components preferentially active in specific chromatin states, sequence contexts, and replication timings. These included signatures of general processes associated with sex and age but also signatures related to specific driver events and molecular subgroups. Catenin beta 1 mutations were major modulators of methylation patterns in HCC, characterized by a targeted hypomethylation of transcription factor 7–bound enhancers in the vicinity of Wnt target genes as well as a widespread hypomethylation of late-replicated partially methylated domains. By contrast, demethylation of early replicated highly methylated domains was a signature of replication stress, leading to an extensive hypomethylator phenotype in cyclin-activated HCC. Inactivating mutations of the chromatin remodeler AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A were associated with epigenetic silencing of differentiation-promoting transcriptional networks, also detectable in cirrhotic liver. Finally, a hypermethylation signature targeting polycomb-repressed chromatin domains was identified in the G1 molecular sub-group with progenitor features.CONCLUSIONS:This study elucidates the diversity of processes remodeling HCC methylomes and reveals the epigenetic and transcriptional impact of driver alterations. (Hepatology 2021;74:816–834).","DNA guanine (G)-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique secondary structures formed by two or more stacked G-tetrads in G-rich DNA sequences. These structures have been found to play a crucial role in highly transcribed genes, especially in cancer-related oncogenes, making them attractive targets for cancer therapeutics. Significantly, targeting oncogene promoter G4 structures has emerged as a promising strategy to address the challenge of undruggable and drug-resistant proteins, such as MYC, BCL2, KRAS, and EGFR. Natural products have long been an important source of drug discovery, particularly in the fields of cancer and infectious diseases. Noteworthy progress has recently been made in the discovery of naturally occurring DNA G4-targeting drugs. Numerous DNA G4s, such as MYC-G4, BCL2-G4, KRAS-G4, PDGFR-β-G4, VEGF-G4, and telomeric-G4, have been identified as potential targets of natural products, including berberine, telomestatin, quindoline, sanguinarine, isaindigotone, and many others. Herein, we summarize and evaluate recent advancements in natural and nature-derived DNA G4 binders, focusing on understanding the structural recognition of DNA G4s by small molecules derived from nature. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with developing drugs that target DNA G4s.",0
"AbstractBackgroundUsing immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO) is a promising approach to maximize clinical benefits for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-L1 expression serves as a predictive factor for treatment outcomes with IO. However, the high cost of this treatment creates significant barriers to access. Substantial evidence demonstrates the sustained clinical benefits experienced by patients who respond to immunotherapy. While IOs show promise in NSCLC treatment, their high cost poses access barriers.AimThis study focused on a prospective cost analysis conducted at a high-specialty health facility to assess the economic implications of implementing a risk-sharing agreement (RSA) for atezolizumab in NSCLC.MethodsThe study included 30 patients with advanced NSCLC, with the pharmaceutical company funding the initial cycles. If patients responded, a government program covered costs until disease progression.ResultsA median progression-free survival of 4.67 months across populations, rising to 9.4 months for responders. The 2-year overall survival rate for the response group was 64%, significantly higher than for non-response. Without an RSA, a total treatment cost of $881 859.36 ($29 395.31/patient) was reported, compared to $530 467.12 ($17 682.24/patient) with an RSA, representing a 40% cost reduction. In responders, the average cost per year of life per patient dropped by 22%. Risk-sharing, assessed through non-parametric tests, showed a statistically significant difference in pharmacological costs (P < .001).ConclusionImplementing RSAs can optimize resource allocation, making IO treatment more accessible, especially in low-income countries.","Background: Medication dosing in overweight and obese children often involves complex weight-based calculations, leading to higher dosing errors, particularly with intravenous drugs. Currently, tools to aid in dosage calculations are lacking for these patients, especially in Thai population. Objective: This study aimed to develop a mobile application with the intent of utilizing it as a tool to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of dosing calculations required for obese and overweight Thai children. Methods: The performance of the application was assessed in 3 key aspects using a sample of 30 healthcare professionals. These key aspects included: 1) the accuracy of dosage calculations, assessed through pre- and posttests comparing manual calculations to app-based calculations using a 10-item questionnaire, 2) the time taken for calculations before and after app usage, 3) user satisfaction, which was measured through a questionnaire. Results: The integration of applications into the calculation demonstrated a significant improvement when compared to the manual calculation in both accuracy (6.10 vs 9.33 out of 10, P < .001) and efficiency (10.40 vs 8.53 minutes per 10 questions, P = .008). Also, the application elicited high levels of satisfaction among users, as reflected by an overall mean satisfaction score of 4.57 on a 5-point scale. Conclusion: The integration of this application to assist in dosage calculations for overweight and obese pediatric Thai patients has yielded favorable outcomes concerning accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Further development should be pursued within a larger cohort, with an emphasis on real-world implementation in clinical settings.",0
"IntroductionGround glass opacity featured lung adenocarcinomas (GGO-LUAD) display more indolent biological behavior than solid nodule featured lung adenocarcinomas (SN-LUAD) and have an excellent prognosis. However, the cellular immune characteristics of GGO-LUAD remain poorly understood.MethodsImmunohistochemistry technique was performed to stain related immune markers (CD8, CD103, CD20, CD138, CD4, FOXP3, CD68, CD163, PD-1 and PD-L1) and TGF-β from 15 patients with pure GGO-LUAD and 15 patients with SN-LUAD tissue sections (Paired cohort), and then, the related markers with significant differences were verified on 10 patients (Verified cohort) with both pure GGO-LUAD and SN-LUAD. For localization analysis of CD68 + tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and FOXP3 + Terg cells in tumor areas, pure GGO-LUAD and SN-LUAD were also stained for simultaneous detection of pan-CK, CD68 and FOXP3 by multiplex immunofluorescence.ResultsIn the Paired cohort, compared with SN-LUAD, only the infiltration of TAMs and Treg cells was significantly lower in GGO-LUAD. The infiltration of the remaining immune cells including CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, CD103 + T cells, CD20 + B cells and CD138 + Plasma cells in GGO-LUAD, although relatively low, was not significantly different. Meanwhile, the expression of TGF-β was significantly higher in SN-LUAD. And the above results have also been confirmed in the Verified cohort. Moreover, there was no significantly difference in PD-L1 expression in GGO-LUAD compared to SN-LUAD both in the Paired cohort and Verified cohort.ConclusionsGGO-LUAD demonstrates an overall less active immune landscape as compared with SN-LUAD. TAMs and TGF-β may play an important role in the progression of GGO-LUAD. More importantly, PD-L1 expression in GGO-LUAD is comparable to that in SN-LUAD, indicating that there may be other reasons for the insensitivity of GGO-LUAD to immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04289-3.","ObjectiveRecent studies have indicated that CD47, interacting with SIRP-α, conveys “don’t eat me” signal in evasion of tumor cells and serves as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical correlation of CD47 and uncover prognostic implications of CD47 and CD68 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsThe specimens from 384 patients with completely resected NSCLC were collected for immunohistochemical assays of CD47 and CD68. Cox multivariate proportion hazard analyses were conducted to confirm the independent prognostic value of CD47 and CD68. TCGA database and GSE37745 were used to identify the association between CD47 and immune cells.ResultsIn 186 pairs of lung cancer and adjacent tissues, the RNA of CD47 was overexpressed in lung cancer tissues (P < 0.001). High expression of CD47 was associated with worse recurrence-free survival in RNA and protein level (P = 0.032 and P < 0.001, respectively). High expression of CD47 was significantly associated with large tumor size (P = 0.004), advanced pathologic TNM stage (P < 0.001), and histology (P = 0.003). Further analyses demonstrated that CD47 and CD68 predicted outcomes of patients independently. In addition, the expression of CD47 correlated with neutrophils, and did not correlated with B cells and CD4 + T cells in the TCGA database and GSE37745.ConclusionCombined use of CD47 and CD68 exhibited excellent performance in predicting survival of patients with NSCLC. CD47 was a potential therapeutic target for immune therapy of lung cancer.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03477-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"PurposeProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression may influence the prognosis of patients with localized esophageal cancer. The current study compared the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression between tumor cells and immune cells.MethodsArchival esophageal tumor tissue samples were collected from patients who received paclitaxel and cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in three prospective phase II trials. PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells was examined immunohistochemically by using the SP142 antibody and scored by two independent pathologists. The association of PD-L1 expression with patient’s outcomes was analyzed using a log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis.ResultsA total of 100 patients were included. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was positive (≥ 1%, TC-positive) in 55 patients; PD-L1 expression on immune cells was high (≥ 5%, IC-high) in 30 patients. TC-positive status was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.63, P = 0.035), whereas IC-high status was associated with improved OS (HR: 0.44, P = 0.0024). Multivariate analysis revealed that TC-positive, IC-high, and performance status were independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival and that IC-high and performance status were independent factors for OS. Furthermore, the combination of IC-high and TC-negative status was associated with the optimal OS, whereas that of TC-positive and IC-low status was associated with the worst OS.ConclusionPD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells may have different prognostic value for patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving neoadjuvant CRT. A combination of these two indexes may further improve the prognostic prediction.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03772-7.","Adipocytes are crucial components of breast cancer and are involved in regulating the progression, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Characterized by storing energy and producing a variety of secretory factors, adipocytes are responsible for inducing obesity and regulating the tumor immune activity. Adipocytes communicate with tumor infiltrating immune cells through the secreted adipokines, cytokines, and exosomes in the breast cancer TIME, which shapes the tumor supporting environment to facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. In-depth studies of the crosstalk between adipocytes and TIME can not only provide a more comprehensive regulatory landscape of TIME, but also be conducive to screening novel targets for future precision targeted therapy. The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies for understanding the role of crosstalk between adipocytes and immune cells in shaping the breast cancer immune microenvironment.",1
"ResumenIntroducción:el trasplante de células progenitoras hematopoyéticas (TCPH) es una terapia que ofrece potencial curación de neoplasias hematológicas. Una limitante es que solo 25% de los pacientes tendrán un donante idéntico. El uso de donantes haploidénticos permite que el 95% de los pacientes tengan donador. La experiencia en México con TCPH haploidéntico es limitada. En 2018 se inició el Programa de Trasplantes Haploidénticos en el Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI.Objetivo:comparar la supervivencia global de los pacientes sometidos a TCPH con donante idéntico y haploidéntico en el Hospital de Especialidades.Material y métodos:se hizo un estudio tipo observacional, retrospectivo, en pacientes sometidos a TCPH en el Hospital de Especialidades, de enero de 2018 a diciembre de 2022. Se incluyeron todos los pacientes trasplantados. Se realizó un análisis de supervivencia global por curvas de Kaplan-Meier. Se consideró un nivel de significación de p < 0.05.Resultados:se analizaron 109 pacientes sometidos a TCPH alogénico, 34% de ellos tuvieron un donante haploidéntico. No hubo diferencias en la supervivencia. El grupo haploidéntico presentó mayor reactivación de citomegalovirus y menor enfermedad del injerto en contra del hospedero (EICH) crónica.Conclusiones:no se encontraron diferencias en la supervivencia en ambos grupos, por lo que el trasplante haploidéntico es una opción de tratamiento en los pacientes que no cuentan con donante idéntico en nuestra institución.","PurposeThe recurrence after curative hepatectomy is common. Limited data have investigated the effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with ablation in treating recurrent intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy. We aim to compare the efficacy of TACE combined with ablation versus TACE alone in treating recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after hepatectomy.MethodsA total of 183 patients with recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after hepatectomy were enrolled at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Centre, including 111 patients who underwent TACE alone and 72 patients who underwent TACE combined with ablation (TACE–Ablation). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared by the log-rank test. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the confounding bias.ResultsBefore PSM, the 5-year OS rates were 43.3% vs. 27.9% (P = 0.001), and the 5-year PFS rates were 21.7% vs. 13.0% (P < 0.001) for TACE–Ablation and TACE-alone groups, respectively. After PSM, TACE–Ablation still resulted in better 5-year OS (41.6% vs. 30.2%, P = 0.028) and 5-year PFS rate (21.3% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.024) than that of TACE alone. Patients in TACE–Ablation group exhibited similar major complication rates to TACE-alone group but higher minor complication rates both before and after PSM. Cox regression analysis identified TACE-alone modality as an independently unfavourable predictor for OS and PFS (both P < 0.05).ConclusionTACE combined with ablation is safe and superior to TACE alone in tumour control and prolonging overall survival in recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after hepatectomy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03254-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"Mouse models remain at the forefront of immuno-oncology research, providing invaluable insights into the complex interactions between the immune system and developing tumors. While several flow cytometry panels have been developed to study the immunity to cancer in mice, most of them present limitations in their capacity to address the complexity of anti-cancer immune responses. For example, many of the panels developed to date focus on a restricted number of leukocyte populations (notably, T cells or antigen-presenting cells), failing to include the multitude of other subsets that participate in anti-cancer immunity. In addition, these panels were developed using blood or splenic leukocytes. While the immune composition of the blood or spleen can provide information on systemic immune responses to cancer, it is in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that local immunity takes place. Therefore, we optimized this spectral flow cytometry panel for identifying the chief cell types that take part in immunity to cancer using immune cells from cancer tissue. We used pancreatic tumors implanted both orthotopically and subcutaneously to demonstrate the panel’s flexibility and suitability in diverse mouse models. The panel was also validated in peripheral immune districts (namely, the blood, spleen, and liver of tumor-harboring mice) to allow comparisons between local and systemic anti-tumor immunity.Basic Protocol 1: Tumor induction – OrthotopicAlternate Protocol 1: Tumor induction – SubcutaneousBasic Protocol 2: Preparation of single cell suspensions from the tumor, spleen, liver, and blood of tumor-bearing miceAlternate Protocol 2: Staining single cell suspensions from the tumor, spleen, liver, and blood of tumor-bearing mice","BackgroundThe High Mobility Group Nucleosomal Binding Domain 1 Gene (HMGN1) is crucial for epigenetic regulation. However, the specific function of HMGN1 in cancer development is unclear.MethodsRaw data on HMGN1 expression were procured from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), the University of Alabama- Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thereafter, the pan-cancer analysis was implemented to understand the HMGN1 expression patterns, prognostic value, and immunological features. Furthermore, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was executed via R language. In addition, the relationship between HMGN1 and the sensitivity of antitumor drugs was also determined. Finally, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were carried out.ResultsPan-cancer analysis revealed that HMGN1 was upregulated in several solid tumors and was associated with pathological staging and poor prognosis. In addition, HMGN1 was found to be involved in regulating the tumor microenvironment. The GSEA enrichment analysis indicated that HMGN1 assisted in the regulation of oncogenic processes, especially metabolic and immune pathways. Furthermore, HMGN1 expression was linked to microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) across diverse tumor types. RT-PCR assays indicated that HMGN1 was overexpressed in the gastric and breast cancer cell lines and tissues.ConclusionThis study highlighted the potential of HMGN1 as a biomarker for pan-cancer analysis.",1
"Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3) is a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein family expressed in the extracellular matrix closely associated with the development and occurrence of various malignant tumors; yet, its function in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is still poorly understood. The following study investigated the progress and mechanism of HAPLN3 on ccRCC using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments. In order to determine whether HAPLN3 is differentially expressed in ccRCC, we analyzed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE40435 and further validated them in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Simultaneously, the TCGA dataset was utilized to study the relationship between HAPLN3 expression and the progression of ccRCC and its prognostic value in ccRCC. Gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore HAPLN3-related signaling pathways in ccRCC. The TIMER database investigates the link for both HAPLN3 and immune cell infiltration. Different ccRCC cell lines the role of HAPLN3 on cell biological behavior in vitro. HAPLN3 was increased in ccRCC, and its high expression was related to the patients' survival rates and clinical characteristics. GSEA showed that HAPLN3 is mainly enriched in proliferative and metastatic pathways. In addition, HAPLN3 was an independently associated significant predictor in patients with ccRCC. Functional experiments demonstrated that HAPLN3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. To sum up, our data suggest that HAPLN3 may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.","IntroductionThe aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic factors in patients with non-metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), with a particular focus on immunological markers such as TILs subtyping (CD3, CD8, CD68, FoxP3, PD-L1 and PD-1) and MCPyV.MethodsPatients treated for a non-metastatic MCC with oncologic surgical resection followed or not by adjuvant radiotherapy between 01/2007 and 12/2018 were analyzed. Local and regional control (LC, RC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Clinical variables analyzed included age, gender, performance status, comorbidity, tumor size, location and presentation type, extension, oncologic resection and adjuvant radiotherapy. Pathological variables analyzed included type of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, CD3, CD8, CD68, PD-L1 expression on immune cells and tumors cells, PD-1, FoxP3 and MCPyV, assessed with immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results77 patients were included. After a median follow-up of 18 months (range 0.2–144), the 1-year LC, RC, DMFS and OS were 83%, 60%, 82% and 75%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a percentage of PD-L1 expression by immune cells ≥ 1% was significantly correlated with improvement of RC (p = 0.012), DMFS (p = 0.003) and OS (p = 0.006). Adjuvant radiotherapy significantly improved DMFS (p = 0.021) and OS (0.041) rates. There was a correlation between the presence of MCPyV + and the expression of PD-L1 on IC (p = 0.05) and TC (p = 0.03).ConclusionPD-L1 expression by immune and tumor cells in non-metastatic MCC seems to significantly improve outcome in patients who did not received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Prospective studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03676-6.",1
"Heart failure and cancer remain 2 of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and the 2 disease entities are linked in a complex manner. Patients with cancer are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications related to the cancer therapies. The presence of cardiomyopathy or heart failure in a patient with new cancer diagnosis portends a high risk for adverse oncology and cardiovascular outcomes. With the rapid growth of cancer therapies, many of which interfere with cardiovascular homeostasis, heart failure practitioners need to be familiar with prevention, risk stratification, diagnosis, and management strategies in cardio-oncology.This Heart Failure Society of America statement addresses the complexities of heart failure care among patients with active cancer diagnoses and cancer survivors. Risk stratification, monitoring and management of cardiotoxicity are presented across stages A through D heart failure, with focused discussion on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and special populations, such as survivors of childhood and young-adulthood cancers. We provide an overview of the shared risk factors between cancer and heart failure, highlighting heart failure as a form of cardiotoxicity associated with many different cancer therapeutics. Finally, we discuss disparities in the care of patients with cancer and cardiac disease and present a framework for a multidisciplinary-team approach and critical collaboration among heart failure, oncology, palliative care, pharmacy, and nursing teams in the management of these complex patients.","ABSTRACTMalignant tumors including gastric cancer (GC) are the leading cause of deaths among reproductive women. Physiological morning sickness can mask the clinical manifestations of GC, whereas the clinical presence of metastatic tumors in the abdominal cavity may be easily mistaken for abdominal swelling caused by fetal growth. Pregnancy and delivery processes in young females could accelerate the growth of GC, leading to its rapid development and grave prognosis. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical and gastrointestinal endoscopy is recommended for any suspected pregnant woman with long-term morning sickness. Treatment strategies, including chemotherapy, resection surgery and radiotherapy, will be determined based on a comprehensive consideration of the status of both the fetus and the mother. Rational management, especially clinical multidisciplinary collaboration may significantly benefit such patients.",1
"AbstractBackground:Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent type of cancer with a high mortality rate in its late stages. One of the major challenges in OSCC treatment is the resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanism underlying drug resistance and develop appropriate precision therapy strategies to enhance clinical efficacy.Methods:To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) inhibitor KN93 and EGFR inhibitors, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments using two FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1)-deficient (SCC9 and SCC25) and two FAT1 wild-type (SCC47 and HN12) OSCC cell lines. We assessed the effects of EGFR inhibitors (afatinib or cetuximab), KN93, or their combination on the malignant phenotype of OSCC in vivo and in vitro. The alterations in protein expression levels of members of the EGFR signaling pathway and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) were analyzed. Changes in the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) protein were characterized. Moreover, we analyzed mitochondrial dysfunction. Besides, the effects of combination therapy on mitochondrial dynamics were also evaluated.Results:OSCC with FAT1 mutations exhibited resistance to EGFR inhibitors treatment. The combination of KN93 and EGFR inhibitors significantly inhibited the proliferation, survival, and migration of FAT1-mutated OSCC cells and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, combination therapy enhanced the therapeutic sensitivity of FAT1-mutated OSCC cells to EGFR inhibitors by modulating the EGFR pathway and downregulated tumor stemness-related proteins. Furthermore, combination therapy induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, ultimately resulting in tumor suppression.Conclusion:Combination therapy with EGFR inhibitors and KN93 could be a novel precision therapeutic strategy and a potential clinical solution for EGFR-resistant OSCC patients with FAT1 mutations.","A rich pipeline of therapeutic candidates is advancing for Parkinson’s disease, many of which are targeting the underlying pathophysiology of disease. Emerging evidence grounded in novel genetics and biomarker discoveries is illuminating the true promise of precision medicine-based therapeutic strategies for PD. There has been a growing effort to investigate disease-modifying therapies by designing clinical trials for genetic forms of PD - providing a clearer link to underlying pathophysiology. Leading candidate genes based on human genetic findings that are under active investigation in an array of basic and translational models include SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA. Broad investigations across mechanistic models show that these genes signal through common molecular pathways, namely, autosomal lysosomal pathways, inflammation and mitochondrial function. Therapeutic clinical trials to date based on genetically defined targets have not yet achieved approvals; however, much is to be learned from such pioneering trials. Fundamental principles of drug development that include proof of pharmacology in target tissue are critical to have confidence in advancing such precision-based therapies. There is a clear need for downstream biomarkers of leading candidate therapies to demonstrate proof of mechanism. The current regulatory landscape is poised and primed to support translational modeling strategies for the effective advancement of PD disease-modifying therapeutic candidates. A convergence of rich complex data that is available, the regulatory framework of model informed drug development (MIDD), and the new biological integrated staging frameworks when combined are collectively setting the stage for advancing new approaches in PD to accelerate progress. This perspective review highlights the potential of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling in contributing to the field and hastening the pace of progress in advancing collaborative approaches for urgently needed PD disease-modifying treatments.",0
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Pathologically, this disease is associated with the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuroinflammation. Current drug treatments primarily focus on managing symptoms rather than stopping disease progression. Disease-modifying therapies target the clearance of amyloid plaques through active and passive immunity methods. Although successful in animal models, human trials have shown adverse effects, such as meningoencephalitis, in a small number of patients who received active immunity methods. The efficacy of active immunity methods in treating AD remains uncertain, but passive immunity methods amyloid-beta (Abeta)-specific monoclonal antibody therapies such as aducanumab and lecanemab have been approved by the FDA. Despite the limitations of immune-based therapies, T-cell, and chimeric antigen receptor-based treatments show promise, but new guidelines are necessary to address potential adverse events. Research into the relationship between adaptive immune responses and AD is expected to provide innovative treatment approaches.","AbstractVolume‐regulated anion channels (VRACs) are heteromeric complexes formed by proteins of the leucine‐rich repeat‐containing 8 (LRRC8) family. LRRC8A (also known as SWELL1) is the core subunit required for VRAC function, and it must combine with one or more of the other paralogues (that is LRRC8B–E) to form functional heteromeric channels. VRACs were discovered in T lymphocytes over 35 years ago and are found in virtually all vertebrate cells. Initially, these anion channels were characterized for their role in Cl− efflux during the regulatory volume decrease process triggered when cells are subjected to hypotonic challenges. However, substantial evidence suggests that VRACs also transport small molecules under isotonic conditions. These findings have expanded the research on VRACs to explore their functions beyond volume regulation. In innate immune cells, VRACs promote inflammation by modulating the transport of immunomodulatory cyclic dinucleotides, itaconate and ATP. In adaptive immune cells, VRACs suppress their function by taking up cyclic dinucleotides to activate the STING signalling pathway. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of LRRC8 proteins in immunity and discuss recent progress in their structure, function, regulation and mechanisms for channel activation and gating. Finally, we also examine potential immunotherapeutic applications of VRAC modulation.",1
"ABSTRACTD2 surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy has been established as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer in Asian countries. However, its efficacy is still unsatisfactory, especially for pathological N3 disease. The RACING trial is a randomized, multicenter, Phase III trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy in combination with PD-1 inhibitor and radiotherapy in patients with pN3 gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. A total of 433 patients will be assigned at a 1:1 ratio to the two arms. The primary end point is the 3-year disease-free survival rate. The secondary end points include the 3-year overall survival rate, 3-year local recurrence-free survival rate, treatment-related adverse events and quality of life.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT04997837 (ClinicalTrials.gov)","ABSTRACTGlioblastoma (GBM), a highly invasive type of brain tumor located within the central nervous system, manifests a median survival time of merely 14.6 months. Radiotherapy kills tumor cells through focused high-energy radiation and has become a crucial treatment strategy for GBM, especially in cases where surgical resection is not viable. However, the presence of radioresistant tumor cells limits its clinical effectiveness. Radioresistance is a key factor of treatment failure, prompting the development of various therapeutic strategies to overcome this challenge. With the rapid development of nanomedicine, nanoradiosensitizers provide a novel approach to enhancing the effectiveness of radiotherapy. In this review, we discuss the reasons behind GBM radio-resistance and the mechanisms of radiotherapy sensitization. Then we summarize the primary types of nanoradiosensitizers and recent progress in their application for the radiosensitization of GBM. Finally, we elucidate the factors influencing their practical implementation, along with the challenges and promising prospects associated with multifunctional nanoradiosensitizers.",1
"PurposeDefining the phenotypic characteristics of CD8+ T cell subsets in gastric cancer (GC) can help remodel the immune microenvironment of the tumor, thereby improving patient prognosis. CD226 has recently been shown to regulate the activity of CD8+ T cell in several malignancies. However, the clinical relevance of CD226+CD8+ T cells in GC remains unclear.MethodsFudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) cohort (n = 316), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n = 407), KUGH/KUCM cohort (n = 202), and Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) cohort (n = 300) were included in prognosis and response to adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) analyses. Flow cytometry and multiplex immunostaining were used to characterize CD226+CD8+ T cells.ResultsCD226+CD8+ T cells predicted favorable outcomes in patients undergoing curative resection for GC. GC patients with high CD226+CD8+ T cell infiltration benefitted more from adjuvant chemotherapy. CD155 is upregulated in GC tissues and is associated with decreased intra-tumoral CD226+CD8+ T cell infiltration. The combination of intra-tumoral CD226+CD8+ T cells and CD155 is a strong prognostic predictor in patients with GC.ConclusionCD226+CD8+ T cells may represent a novel therapeutic target and a useful marker of prognosis and therapeutic response in patients with GC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04346-x.","Undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHPS) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma (STS) originated from mesenchyme. UHPS is mostly advanced, aggressive and has poor prognosis. Patients with UHPS tend to have a lower 5-year survival rate than patients with other types of STS. NTRK fusions are commonly found in rare histological tumor types. Among sarcomas, 90% of infantile fibrosarcomas have NTRK fusions. Many other types of sarcomas have also been studied for NTRK fusions. Targeted therapy with NTRK inhibitors, such as Larotrectinib and Entrectinib, leads to response in most patients with NTRK1/2/3 gene fusion-positive tumors. Herein, we present a 68-years old man with UHPS by pathological diagnosis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a novel TMTC2-NTRK3 fusion, which was also detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This report broadens the spectrum of NTRK fusions in UHPS and highlights a new target for treatment.",0
"PurposeIn recent times, multiple molecular subtypes with varying prognoses have been identified in bladder cancer (BLCA). However, the attributes of butyrate metabolism-related (BMR) molecular subtypes and their correlation with immunotherapy response remain inadequately explored in BLCA.MethodsWe utilized 594 samples of BLCA to investigate the molecular subtypes mediated by BMR genes and their correlation with the immunotherapy response. To quantify the BMR features of individual tumors, we developed a BMR score through the COX and LASSO regression methods. Clinical-related, tumor microenvironment, drug-sensitive and immunotherapy analyses were used to comprehensively analyze BMR scores.ResultsTwo distinct molecular subtypes related to butyrate metabolism were identified in BLCA, each with unique prognostic implications and immune microenvironments. BMR score was constructed based on 7 BMR genes and was used to classify the patients into two score groups. Clinical analysis revealed that the BMR score was an independent prognostic factor. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. The BMR score can also predict tumor immunity. The results demonstrated that a low BMR score was associated with higher efficacy of immunotherapy, which was also validated by an external dataset.ConclusionOur study proposes both molecular subtypes and a BMR-based score as promising prognostic classifications in BLCA. These findings may offer new insights for the development of precise targeted cancer therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05067-5.","PurposeSignificant disparities exist in cancer detection, treatment, and outcomes for racial/ethnic minoritized groups in the US. The objective of this study was to explore racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare utilization, cancer care experiences, and beliefs about cancer in patients diagnosed with cancer among diverse racial/ethnic groups in the US.MethodsData from the Health Information National Trends Survey -Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (HINTS-SEER 2021) were analyzed for 1,108 cancer survivors. Bivariate analysis of the study variables with race/ethnicity were conducted with weighted analysis from STATA version 17. Sampling weights using svy was conducted.ResultsRacial/ethnic differences in healthcare utilization remained significant when controlling for the confounding factors. Asians and Hispanics were less likely to have a regular healthcare provider compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW) (aOR = 3.31, p = .003; aOR = 2.17, p = .014; respectively). Asians were less likely than NHW to have had healthcare provider visits in the past 12 months (aOR = 4.89, p = .011). There were no statistically significant differences between racial/ethnic groups in the cancer care experiences. Racial/ethnic differences in fatalistic beliefs about cancer were not significant in the final multivariate model; however, being older (β = −.41, p = .033), and having a higher education level (β = −1.23, p < .001), were associated with lower level of fatalistic beliefs about cancer.ConclusionThe findings suggest tailored approaches to improve healthcare utilization rates among racial/ethnic minoritized groups and highlight the need for increased research and clinical practice efforts to address racial/ethnic disparities in the cancer care continuum.",0
"ABSTRACTFor the past few years, researchers and oncologists have been pushing to find biomarkers that would help predict which treatment option would best work on a patient. Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is one of the latest biomarkers that is being studied and considered as a promising agnostic immunotherapy biomarker. However, it still shows controversial results in studies due to the difficulty in finding solid comparable results. This is a consequence of different cutoff definitions among many cancer types, age ranges, and the use of different sequencing assays, in addition to its association with other biomarkers such as PD-L1. Finally, the use of composite biomarkers to assess the genetic signature of a tumor might be the way forward to seriously use TMB as an agnostic biomarker.","ABSTRACTBackgroundTumoral melanosis (TM) is a histological term to describe a nodular aggregation of macrophages containing melanin pigment (melanophages) that is devoid of viable melanocytes. It is most often identified in skin, where it may be appreciated clinically as a pigmented lesion; however, it can also be found in other organs such as lymph nodes. The presence of TM is usually thought to signify the presence of a regressed melanoma or other pigmented tumor. Until recently, it was a relatively uncommon finding; however, with the use of effective systemic therapies against melanoma, its occurrence in histological specimens is more frequent.MethodsWe identified and reviewed all histopathological diagnoses of TM at any organ site reported at a single institution from 2006 to 2018. TM cases were paired with non‐TM cases of cutaneous melanoma through propensity score matching at a 1:2 ratio, and their survival outcomes were compared. The clinical outcomes examined included recurrence‐free survival (RFS), distant disease‐free survival (DDFS), melanoma‐specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).ResultsTM was reported in 79 patients. Their median age was 65 years (range 22–88), with a 2:1 male predominance (51 out of 79, 65%). The most common organ involved was the skin (67%), with a third of all cases localized to a lower limb (36%). TM had a strong association with the presence of melanoma (91%) and regression at other sites of melanoma (54%), suggesting that it is part of a systemic immune response against melanoma. Most patients with TM either previously or subsequently developed histologically confirmed melanoma in the same anatomical region as the TM (89%). Thirty‐five TM patients were matched with 70 non‐TM cases. Patients with melanoma who developed TM without prior regional or systemic therapy showed improved MSS (p = 0.03), whereas no statistically significant differences were observed in terms of RFS, DDFS, and OS.ConclusionsTM usually occurs in the context of a previous or subsequent cutaneous melanoma and is associated with improved MSS. It is important that TM is recognized by pathologists and documented in pathology reports.",1
"Immunotherapy has revolutionized the systemic treatment of solid tumors, including advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC), providing durable responses with a favorable safety profile. Multiple immune checkpoint inhibitor agents have been approved in monotherapy in second-line setting, and for a selected group of chemo-naïve cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression. Despite the incorporation of immunotherapy to the systemic treatment landscape of aUC, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in frontline setting for vast majority of patients. Urothelial carcinoma is a chemosensitive disease with response rates of up to 50% to frontline chemotherapy. However, the response to chemotherapy is short lasting with vast majority of patients experiencing disease progression and death within months. In this context, maintenance therapy constitutes an attractive therapeutic strategy to maximize the time to treatment failure. Different cytotoxic and targeted agents have been investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC but have not shown an impact on survival. Avelumab has become the first and only drug to improve overall survival as maintenance therapy after frontline platinum-based therapy in aUC patients and the first drug to be approved in this setting. This article will review the rational for maintenance therapy, the different drugs investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC, and the impact of avelumab maintenance therapy as a new standard of care in the management of aUC.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies that block inhibitors of T cell activation and function. With the widespread use of ICIs in cancer therapy, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have gradually emerged as urgent clinical issues. Tumors not only exhibit high heterogeneity, and their response to ICIs varies, with “hot” tumors showing better anti-tumor effects but also a higher susceptibility to irAEs. The manifestation of irAEs displays a tumor-heterogeneous pattern, correlating with the tumor type in terms of the affected organs, incidence, median onset time, and severity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathogenic patterns of irAEs can provide novel insights into the prevention and management of irAEs, guide the development of biomarkers, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the toxicological characteristics of ICIs. In this review, we explore the impact of tumor type on the therapeutic efficacy of ICIs and further elucidate how these tumor types influence the occurrence of irAEs. Finally, we assess key candidate biomarkers and their relevance to proposed irAE mechanisms. This paper also outlines management strategies for patients with various types of tumors, based on their disease patterns.",1
"ObjectiveThe alternative extension of the telomeres (ALT) mechanism is activated in lower grade glioma (LGG), but the role of the ALT mechanism has not been well discussed. The primary purpose was to demonstrate the significance of the ALT mechanism in prognosis estimation for LGG patients.MethodGene expression and clinical data of LGG patients were collected from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, respectively. ALT-related genes obtained from the TelNet database and potential prognostic genes related to ALT were selected by LASSO regression to calculate an ALT-related risk score. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to construct a prognosis signature, and a nomogram was used to represent this signature. Possible pathways of the ALT-related risk score are explored by enrichment analysis.ResultThe ALT-related risk score was calculated based on the LASSO regression coefficients of 22 genes and then divided into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the median. The ALT-related risk score is an independent predictor of LGG (HR and 95% CI in CGGA cohort: 5.70 (3.79, 8.58); in TCGA cohort: 1.96 (1.09, 3.54)). ROC analysis indicated that the model contained ALT-related risk score was superior to conventional clinical features (AUC: 0.818 vs 0.729) in CGGA cohorts. The results in the TCGA cohort also shown a powerful ability of ALT-related risk score (AUC: 0.766 vs 0.691). The predicted probability and actual probability of the nomogram are consistent. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that the ALT mechanism was involved in the cell cycle, DNA repair, immune processes, and others.ConclusionALT-related risk score based on the 22-gene is an important factor in predicting the prognosis of LGG patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05155-6.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is one of the first-line clinical therapeutic strategies for HCC. Still, the effectiveness of chemotherapy is hampered by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and drug resistance caused by insufficient delivery. Herein, we developed a metal-drug self-delivery nanomedicine (FDAH) to improve the chemo/chemodynamic therapeutic efficacy of HCC. The core of FDAH is an iron-based nanoparticle chelated with two clinical drugs, Doxorubicin (DOX) and Plerixafor (AMD3100). Additionally, the nanomedicine is externally modified with a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell, which can prolong the circulation time of the nanoparticles in the bloodstream after intravenous administration. After entering the bloodstream, the nanomedicine reaches the tumor tissue through the EPR effect and is phagocytosed by the tumor cells via HA/CD44-specific interaction. Iron ion-mediated chemodynamic therapy is mediated by the Fenton reaction to generate ROS, causing an imbalance of redox homeostasis within the tumor cells and enhancing the sensitivity of tumor cells to DOX. In addition, AMD3100 intervenes in the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to influence the infiltration level of immune cells and promote DOX chemotherapy in tumor cells. This work suggests that alleviating immunosuppression via a metal-drug self-delivery system of the CXCR4 inhibitor can effectively improve the DOX chemotherapy and iron ions-mediated chemodynamic therapy.",0
"BackgroundIn Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Qi-deficiency and Phlegm-turbid stagnation (QP) are the most prevalent Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome.MethodsHerein, we collected 90 fecal samples (Healthy individual (H): 30; other syndrome (O): 30; QP: 30) and explored the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in LUAD patients with QP syndrome using 16s-rRNA sequencing. Then, we identified biomarkers for QP syndrome in LUAD patients with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) and applied logistic regression analysis to construct a diagnostic model evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and validated with data from metagenomics.ResultsThe α diversity and β diversity revealed that the microbiota community structure in LUAD patients with QP syndrome was different from that with healthy individuals and LUAD patients with other syndromes. At the phylum level, the QP group had more abundance of Bacteroidetes and less Proteobacteria than the O group. At the genus level, the abundance of 4 genera (Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, and Flavonifractor) was different between the QP group and O group. Moreover, LEfSe indicated that those 4 genera might be the biomarkers for LUAD patients with QP syndrome. Then, we used those 4 genera to develop a diagnostic model. The AUC based on 16s-rRNA sequencing and metagenomics was 0.989 and 1, respectively.ConclusionA diagnostic model was developed, which would be an available tool for the clinical diagnosis of LUAD with QP syndrome.","To more accurately diagnose and treat patients with different subtypes of thyroid cancer, we constructed a diagnostic model related to the iodine metabolism of THCA subtypes. THCA expression profiles, corresponding clinicopathological information, and single-cell RNA-seq were downloaded from TCGA and GEO databases. Genes related to thyroid differentiation score were obtained by GSVA. Through logistic analyses, the diagnostic model was finally constructed. DCA curve, ROC curve, machine learning, and K-M analysis were used to verify the accuracy of the model. qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression of hub genes in vitro. There were 104 crossover genes between different TDS and THCA subtypes. Finally, 5 genes (ABAT, CHEK1, GPX3, NME5, and PRKCQ) that could independently predict the TDS subpopulation were obtained, and a diagnostic model was constructed. ROC, DCA, and RCS curves exhibited that the model has accurate prediction ability. K-M and subgroup analysis results showed that low model scores were strongly associated with poor PFI in THCA patients. The model score was significantly negatively correlated with T cell follicular helper. In addition, the diagnostic model was significantly negatively correlated with immune scores. Finally, the results of qRT-PCR corresponded with bioinformatics results. This diagnostic model has good diagnostic and prognostic value for THCA patients, and can be used as an independent prognostic indicator for THCA patients.",1
"PurposeTo demonstrate the biological function of Secreted Phosphoprotein 1(SPP1) and its immune suppressive role in the progression intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).MethodsWe collected 62,770 cells’ published transcriptome data of nine patients whose paired adjacent liver and tumor tissues were both available. We applied differential gene expression analysis to screen potential ICC marker genes, survival analysis to verify the prognostic value of SPP1, and correlation analysis to decipher factors that are related to SPP1 expression. The CellChat was used to distinguish interactions between cancer and T cells. CytoSig was applied to query cytokines that modulate CD44. Further, we established a proliferation score and correlated the score with inhibitory signals to determine the proliferation-suppressive function of SPP1-CD44.ResultsSPP1 expression is significantly upregulated in tumoral epitheliums, and patients with higher SPP1 expression have worse survival (P < 0.05). Tumor cells communicate with T cells via SPP1-CD44 interactions. The average expression of SPP1 in malignant cells (SPP1m) and CD44 in T cells (CD44t) is moderately negatively correlated with T cell proliferation score. Immunosuppressive cytokine TGFβ-3 identified as an inducer of CD44 and was significantly negatively correlated with proliferation score (R = − 0.88, P < 0.01), and the negative correlation was aggravated in samples with high CD44 expression.ConclusionSPP1 is a prognostic marker of ICC and is associated with the genome heterogeneity. SPP1-CD44 hinders sustained proliferation of T cells, but immunosuppressive T cells in the tumor microenvironment may evade this inhibition by reducing CD44 expression.

We aimed to identify the plasma metabolomic biomarkers that could be used for preoperative risk stratification of ICC patients.Methods108 eligible ICC patients who underwent radical surgical resection between August 2012 and October 2020 were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into a discovery cohort (n = 76) and a validation cohort (n = 32) by 7:3. Metabolomics profiling of preoperative plasma was performed and clinical data were collected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, Cox regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to screen and validate the survival-related metabolic biomarker panel and construct a LASSO-Cox prediction model.Results10 survival-related metabolic biomarkers were used for construction of a LASSO-Cox prediction model. In the discovery and validation cohorts, the LASSO-Cox prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.876 (95%CI: 0.777–0.974) and 0.860 (95%CI: 0.711–1.000) in evaluating 1-year OS of ICC patients, respectively. The OS of ICC patients in the high-risk group was significantly worse than that in the low-risk group (discovery cohort, p < 0.0001; validation cohort: p = 0.041). Also, the LASSO-Cox risk score (HR 2.43, 95%CI: 1.81–3.26, p < 0.0001) was a significant independent risk factor associated with OS.ConclusionsThe LASSO-Cox prediction model has potential as an important tool in evaluating the OS of ICC patients after surgical resection and can be used as prediction tools to implement the best treatment options that could result in better outcomes.",1
"AbstractPathogens can be involved in tumor initiation, promotion, and progression through different mechanisms, and their treatment can prevent new cancer cases, improve outcomes, and revert poor‐prognostic phenotypes. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) successfully treats different types of cancers and infections and, therefore, has a unique potential to address their combination. However, we believe this potential has been underutilized, and few researchers have investigated the impacts of PDT of both infection‐related and cancer‐related outcomes at once. This review presents the main agents behind cancer‐associated infections (CAIs), the PDT protocols that have been tested on them, and their key findings. Additionally, we discuss the key aspects of PDT that make it ideal for CAI treatment, and what knowledge gaps need to be filled in order to make it successful.","Background:Actinic keratoses (AK) are rough scaly patches that arise on chronically ultraviolet-exposed skin and can progress to keratinocyte carcinoma. Treatment options for AK include topical medications, photodynamic therapy, cryosurgery, and laser ablation.Objective:This executive summary provides a synopsis of the 18 evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of AK detailed in the Guidelines of Care for the Management of Actinic Keratosis.Methods:A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review to address 5 clinical questions on the management of AKs and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading clinical recommendations. Graded recommendations were voted on to achieve consensus.Results:Analysis of the evidence resulted in 18 recommendations, suggesting there are several effective treatments available for AK.Limitations:The analysis informing the recommendations was based on the best available evidence at the time it was conducted. The results of future studies may necessitate a revision of current recommendations.Conclusions:Strong recommendations are presented for using ultraviolet protection, topical imiquimod, topical 5-fluorouracil, and cryosurgery. Conditional recommendations are presented for the use of photodynamic therapy and diclofenac for the treatment of AK, both individually and as part of combination therapy regimens.",1
"PurposeThis research aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of baseline prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for the outcome of individuals diagnosed with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on data from 810 patients with non-metastatic NPC who underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. The best cut-offs for PNI and LDH were identified by X-tile software to be 48.5 and 150, respectively. To find the independent prognostic factors for survival outcomes, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted, and AUCs were used to compare their prognostic values.ResultsMultivariate analysis revealed that patients with PNI > 48.5 had better overall survival (OS) (HR: 0.502, P < 0.001), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 0.618, P < 0.001), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (HR: 0.637, P = 0.005). Higher LDH was associated with poorer OS (HR: 1.798, P < 0.001), PFS (HR: 1.671, P < 0.001), and DMFS (HR: 1.756, P < 0.001). The combination of low PNI and high LDH in non-metastatic NPC patients was correlated with poor OS (P < 0.001), PFS (P < 0.001), and DMFS (P < 0.001). The combination of PNI and LDH had the highest AUCs for predicting OS, PFS, and DMFS.ConclusionsPNI and LDH might become valuable predictors of the prognosis of non-metastatic NPC patients undergoing IMRT with or without chemotherapy. Prognostic accuracy can be enhanced by combining PNI and LDH.","PurposeAs molecules responsible for presenting antigens to T lymphocytes, leukocytes antigens (HLAs) play a vital role in cancer immunology. This review aims to provide current understanding of HLAs in tumour immunology.MethodsPerspectives on how HLA alterations may contribute to the immune escape of cancer cells and resistance to immunotherapy, and potential methods to overcome HLA defects were summarized. In addition, we discussed the potential association between HLA and immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which has not been reviewed elsewhere.ResultsDownregulation, loss of heterogeneity and entire loss of HLAs are responsible for the immune escape of tumour cells. The strategies to overcome the HLA defects can be effective therapies of cancer. Compared with classical HLA-I, non-classical HLA-I molecules, such as HLA-E and HLA-G, appear to be more reliable predictors of prognosis, as they tend to play immunosuppressive roles in antitumor response. Relative diversified or high expression of classical HLA-I are potential predictors of favourable response of immunotherapy. Certain HLA types may be associated to enhanced affinity to self-antigen-mimicked tumour-antigens, thus may positively correlated to irAEs triggered by checkpoint inhibitors.ConclusionsFurther studies exploring the relationship between HLAs and cancer may not only lead to the development of novel therapies but also bring about better management of irAEs.",0
"Sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) are a prominent group of plant secondary metabolites predominantly found in the Asteraceae family and have multiple ecological roles and medicinal applications. This review describes the evolutionary and ecological significance of STLs, highlighting their roles in plant defence mechanisms against herbivory and as phytotoxins, alongside their function as environmental signalling molecules. We also cover the substantial role of STLs in medicine and their mode of action in health and disease. We discuss the biosynthetic pathways and the various modifications that make STLs one of the most diverse groups of metabolites. Finally, we discuss methods for identifying and predicting STL biosynthesis pathways.This article is part of the theme issue ‘The evolution of plant metabolism’.","Glioma is the primary malignant tumor with the highest incidence rate in the adult central nervous system. The application of bioinformatics methods to analyze the RNA sequences of multiple gliomas revealed that the CDT1 gene has a significant impact on the cell cycle of glioma cells. Subsequently, we comprehensively and systematically investigated the expression of CDT1 in gliomas through bioinformatics analysis, clinical tissue specimens, and in vitro functional experiments. Our study is the first to report the expression of CDT1 in glioma. Our findings demonstrate that CDT1 plays a crucial role in the proliferation and invasion of glioma.

"BackgroundOvarian Cancer (OC) is the deadliest gynecology malignancy, whose high recurrence rate in OC patients is a challenging object. Therefore, having deep insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms of OC recurrence can improve the target therapeutic procedures. This study aimed to discover crucial miRNAs for the detection of tumor recurrence in OC by artificial intelligence approaches.MethodThrough the ANOVA feature selection method, we selected 100 candidate miRNAs among 588 miRNAs. For their classification, a deep-learning model was employed to validate the significance of the candidate miRNAs. The accuracy, F1-score (high-risk), and AUC–ROC of classification test data based on the 100 miRNAs were 73%, 0.81, and 0.65, respectively. Association rule mining was used to discover hidden relations among the selected miRNAs.ResultFive miRNAs, including miR-1914, miR-203, miR-135a-2, miR-149, and miR-9–1, were identified as the most frequent items among high-risk association rules. The identified miRNAs may target genes/proteins involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), resistance to therapy, and cancer stem cells; being responsible for the heterogeneity and plasticity of the tumor. Our conclusion presents mir-1914 as the significant candidate miRNA and the most frequent item. Current knowledge indicates that the dysregulated miR-1914 may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in the development of cancer.ConclusionThese candidate miRNAs can be considered a powerful tool in the diagnosis of OC recurrence. We hypothesize that mir-1914 might open a new line of research in the realm of managing the recurrence of OC and could be a significant factor in triggering OC recurrence.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04468-2.","BackgroundMicrosatellite instability (MSI) is one of the essential tumor biomarkers for cancer treatment and prognosis. The presence of more significant PD-L1 expression on the surface of tumor cells in endometrial cancer with MSI suggests that MSI may be a promising biomarker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. However, the conventional testing methods are labor-intensive and expensive for patients.MethodsInspired by classifiers for MSI based on fast and low-cost deep-learning methods in previous investigations, a new architecture for MSI classification based on an attention module is proposed to extract features from pathological images. Especially, slide-level microsatellite status will be obtained by the bag of words method to aggregate probabilities predicted by the proposed model. The H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas endometrial cohort are collected as the dataset. The performances of the proposed model were primarily evaluated by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-Score.ResultsOn the randomly divided test dataset, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.80, a sensitivity of 0.857, a F1-Score of 0.826, and an AUROC of 0.799. We then visualize the results of the microsatellite status classification to capture more specific morphological features, helping pathologists better understand how deep learning performs the classification.ConclusionsThis study implements the prediction of microsatellite status in endometrial cancer cases using deep-learning methods directly from H&E-stained WSIs. The proposed architecture can help the model capture more valuable features for classification. In contrast to current laboratory testing methods, the proposed model creates a more convenient screening tool for rapid automated testing for patients. This method can potentially be a clinical method for detecting the microsatellite status of endometrial cancer.",1
"BackgroundBladder cancer (BLCA) is a prevalent urological tumor with high morbidity and mortality. However, BLCA treatment remains challenging due to a lack of effective biomarkers. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), as active participants in tumor progression are involved in multiple biological regulatory mechanisms, and cuproptosis-related genes participate in the development of cancer. It is important to discover cuproptosis- related lncRNAs for BLCA diagnosis and treatment.MethodsA predictive signature was constructed based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses of the 9 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs. Samples were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group based on their median risk scores to explore their prognosis.ResultsThis signature is well predictive, as evidenced by the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) and K-M curves. Based on the nomogram, we were able to visually forecast the survival rates of patients with BLCA at 1-, 3-, and 5-year, and the calibration plots displayed that the actual results were well matched with the predicted 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, BLCA patients in the high-risk group had a higher Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score and lower TMB. Finally, we investigated the response of antitumor drugs for BLCA patients in different risk groups, and a statistically significant difference was observed in the sensitivity of those drugs between low- and the high-risk groups.ConclusionAccording to the 9 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs, we constructed a signature which can be served as a promising prognostic biomarker for BLCA patients.","AbstractIntroductionImmunotherapy is the first-line treatment for intermediate-advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although its outcomes vary. This study aimed to identify imaging biomarkers of immunotherapy susceptibility linked to gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) and immune phenotypes, particularly immune-excluded phenotypes, with a tumor immune barrier.MethodsWe performed immunohistochemical staining with a CD8+ antibody, and samples were classified into immune-inflamed, -intermediate, -excluded, and -ignored phenotypes. We assessed EOB-MRI findings obtained from 104 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC and evaluated the relationship between MRI findings and immune phenotype. Spatial transcriptome analysis of tumor tissues in each immune phenotype was performed to characterize the MRI findings. For validation, we analyzed the treatment effect on 60 nodules in another cohort of 27 patients who received combined immunotherapy using anti-programmed death-ligand 1 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies.ResultsHCCs with rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) (odds ratio [OR] 17.3, p = 0.009), peritumoral enhancement in the arterial phase (OR: 8.6, p < 0.004), and intermediate intensity on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) measured with a visual 3-point scale (OR: 28.2, p = 0.002) were associated with immune-excluded phenotype, where tumors tended to be larger and of the single nodular type with extranodular growth and confluent multinodular rather than the simple nodular type. Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed a spatial relationship among cytotoxic T lymphocytes, VEGF signals, and cancer-associated fibroblasts at the tumor-invasive margins in this phenotype. From the validation study, nodules with any one of these three imaging findings had a significantly prolonged time to-nodular progression (p = 0.007, median not reached vs. 226 days).ConclusionHCCs with rim APHE, peritumoral enhancement in arterial phase, and intermediate intensity on HBP with visual 3-point scale could be non-invasive biomarkers to predict the immune-excluded phenotype with the tumor immune barrier. These HCCs were most likely to respond to combined immunotherapy.",1
"AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.","ABSTRACTObjective:The term post-COVID (coronavirus disease) is used to refer to the presence of prolonged symptoms 12 weeks or more after the disease treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of symptoms and anxiety in patients with COVID-19 who did not require inpatient care at the third and sixth months following symptom onset.Materials and Methods:The study is a prospective cohort study involving 471 university employees who contracted COVID-19 between October 2020 and October 2021. Data were obtained through the disease contact follow-up program implemented at the university and phone interviews conducted at the third and sixth months from symptom onset.Results:The study group comprised 361 individuals at three months and 109 at six months from symptom onset. The study found that symptoms persisted in 116 (32.1%) people in the third month and in 47 (13.0%) people in the sixth month. The most common symptoms at three months were shortness of breath, fatigue, and fatigue, while fatigue, fatigue, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms at six months.Conclusion:Understanding the long-term effects of coronavirus will enhance the management of the disease. As a result, the follow-up of symptomatic COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients will become more systematic and effective.",0
"AbstractWith substantial effects on human health, air pollution has become a major global concern. Air pollution has been linked to numerous gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases with increasing mortalities. The gut and respiratory dysbiosis brought about by air pollution has recently received much attention. This review attempts to provide an overview of the types of air pollutants, their sources, their impact on the respiratory and gut dysbiotic patterns and their correlation with five major diseases including pneumonia, asthma, COPD, lung cancer and irritable bowel syndrome. Deeper insights into the links between pollutants, dysbiosis and disease may pave the way for novel diagnostic biomarkers for prognosis and early detection of these diseases, as well as ways to ease the disease burden.","AbstractSuperficial cancers typically refer to cancers confined to the surface layers of tissue. Low-targeting therapies or side effects prompt exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), due to their unique optical properties, serve as effective photosensitizers, enabling tumor ablation through photothermal therapy (PTT). PTT induced by AuNPs can be achieved through light sources externally applied to the skin. Near-infrared radiation is the main light candidate due to its deep tissue penetration capability. This review explores recent advancements in AuNP-based PTT for superficial cancers, specifically breast, head and neck, thyroid, bladder and prostate cancers. Additionally, challenges and future directions in utilizing AuNPs for cancer treatment are discussed, emphasizing the importance of balancing efficacy with safety in clinical applications.",0
"AbstractGastric cancer remains a considerable global health burden, with limited treatment options available for advanced cases, especially for superaged patients. Cadonilimab, a first-in-class bi-specific antibody (BsAb), offer a promising immunotherapy approach by targeting PD-1/CTLA-4 simultaneously. Herein, we present a case report of an 85-year-old patient with HER2-negative advanced gastric cancer who received first-line treatment with cadonilimab combined with chemotherapy, but cadonilimab was discontinued due to the observation of immune-related pneumonitis during treatment. Despite these changes, the patient still exhibited a stable disease condition for a year until now. This case report highlights the potential of cadonilimab in the treatment of superaged patients with advanced gastric cancer, while the efficacy and safety of it need to be further evaluated.","No studies have examined the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and HPV-18 on survival, inflammation biomarkers, and immune function in early-stage cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery. Patients diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer were screened for high-risk HPV prior to surgery. The influence of HPV infection on survival, inflammatory markers, and immune function was investigated. Findings revealed that patients in the HPV-18 positive subgroup exhibited poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and elevated levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, along with decreased CD4+ T cells compared to patients who tested negative for HPV-18. Notably, early-stage cervical cancer patients with HPV-18 infection experienced worse DFS, heightened inflammatory markers, and compromised immune function.",0
"ABSTRACTMetastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can present with oligometastatic disease and/or develop oligoprogression following systemic therapy. Cytoreductive and focal metastasis-directed therapy options include resection, stereotactic ablative radiation and thermal ablation. Aggressive focal therapy may allow delay in initiation of or modification to systemic therapy and improve clinical outcomes. In this narrative review we synthesize current practice guidelines and prospective data on focal therapy management options and highlight future research. Patient selection and the choice of focal treatment techniques are controversial due to limited and heterogeneous data and patients may benefit from multidisciplinary evaluation. Prospective comparative trials with clearly defined inclusion criteria and relevant end points are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of different approaches.","AbstractThe aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role of circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection in the surgical assessment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with thrombi.Nine patients diagnosed with renal mass and thrombi were enrolled from June 2018 to January 2019. Blood samples were collected for CTC detection using SE-iFISH assay. CD45, DAPI, programmed death ligand 1, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with the centromere of chromosome 8 (CEP8) were immune-stained for analysis. Patient demographics, clinical features, pathological characteristics, and CTC detection results were extracted for analysis.Seven of 9 patients (77.8%) had 12 detectable CTCs, 5 of which were with CEP8-positive signal ≥5 and the others were CEP8-positive signal = 3. All 3 patients (100%) with IVC invasion had detectable CTCs, whereas CTCs were detected in 4 of 6 patients (66.7%) without IVC invasion. CEP8 analysis revealed that CTCs in IVC invasion patients were all of CEP8-positive signal ≥5 status, whereas only half of the CTCs in patients without IVC invasion were of CEP8-positive signal ≥5 pattern.In conclusion, both CTC subtype and total CTC number may serve as a marker for predicting inferior vena cava invasion in RCC patients.",1
"AbstractThis review discusses terminology recently proposed for the classification of dementia and, more specifically, nosology related to aging-associated TDP-43 pathology: limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), and limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS). While the “gold standard” for these clinical conditions is still LATE neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC), clinical criteria and biomarkers are evolving. The newly proposed clinical rubrics are discussed with emphasis on the need for terminology that acknowledges the distinctions between clinical syndrome-, molecular biomarker-, and pathologically defined disease concepts. As further progress is made on research into the specific biomarker-based detection and prediction of TDP-43 proteinopathy in the clinical setting, the definitions of “Probable” and “Possible” LATE are likely to become more useful clinically. For people interested in the pathological diagnoses or basic research related to LATE-NC, the relevant terminology remains unchanged by the newly proposed clinical criteria.","BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"The field of onco-microbiome is rapidly expanding. Multiple studies have shown the crucial role of gut microbiota in the regulation of nutrient metabolism, immunomodulation and protection against pathogens. Tools for manipulating the gut microbiota include dietary modification and faecal microbiota transfer. Accumulating evidence has also documented the application of specific intestinal microbiome in cancer immunotherapy, notably in enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aim of this review is to focus on the East Asian microbiome and to provide a current overview of microbiome science and its clinical application in cancer biology and immunotherapy.","SummaryBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are cornerstones of first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC); however, optimal treatment sequencing after progression is unknown. This study assessed outcomes of tivozanib–nivolumab vs tivozanib monotherapy in patients with mRCC who have progressed following 1 or 2 lines of therapy in the post-ICI setting.MethodsTiNivo-2 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial at 190 sites across 16 countries. Patients with aRCC and progression during or after 1–2 prior lines of therapy (including one ICI) were randomised 1:1 to tivozanib (0·89 mg/day, oral) plus nivolumab (480 mg every 4 weeks, IV) or tivozanib (1·34 mg/day, oral). Randomisation was stratified by immediate prior therapy (ICI/ non-ICI) and IMDC risk category. Primary endpoint was PFS by independent radiology review. Efficacy was evaluated in ITT, and safety was assessed in patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04987203).FindingsFrom November 4, 2021–June 16, 2023, 343 patients were randomised to tivozanib–nivolumab (n=171) or tivozanib monotherapy (n=172). Median follow-up was 12·0 months. mPFS was 5·7 months (95%CI, 4·04–7·43) with tivozanib–nivolumab and 7·4 months (5·55–9·23) with tivozanib (HR, 1·10; 95%CI, 0·84–1·43; p=0·49). Among those with ICI as immediate prior therapy (n=244), mPFS was 7·4 months (95%CI, 5·55–9·56) with tivozanib–nivolumab and 9·2 months (7·43–9·99) with tivozanib. With non-ICI as most recent therapy, lower mPFS was observed, with no difference between arms (tivozanib–nivolumab, 3·7 months [95%CI, 2·73–5·42]; tivozanib, 3·7 months [1·94–7·16]). Serious adverse events occurred in 54/168 patients (32%) receiving tivozanib–nivolumab and 64/171 patients (37%) receiving tivozanib. One (<1%) treatment-related death occurred (tivozanib arm).Interpretation.These data further support that ICI rechallenge should be discouraged in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, these data suggest that tivozanib monotherapy has efficacy in the post-ICI setting.FundingAveo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",0
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.","PurposeExposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can predispose to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) involving the gastrointestinal tract. The association between ICIs and bowel perforation has not been well studied. We aimed to describe the clinical course, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients experiencing bowel perforation during or after ICI treatment.MethodsThis retrospective, single-center study included adult cancer patients with bowel perforation that occurred between the first dose of ICI treatment and up to 1 year thereafter between 1/1/2010 and 4/30/2021. Patients’ clinical course, imaging, treatment, and outcomes related to bowel perforation were collected and analyzed.ResultsOf the 13,991 patients who received ICIs during the study period, 90 (0.6%) met the inclusion criteria. A majority were male (54.4%), the most common cancer type was melanoma (23.3%), and most patients had received PD-1/L1 inhibitor treatment (58.8%). Onset of perforation occurred after a median of four ICI treatment cycles. The most common symptom was abdominal pain (95.5%). The colon was the most common location for the perforation (37.7%). Evidence of diverticulitis, enterocolitis, or appendicitis was seen in 32 (35.6%) patients, and 6 (6.6%) patients had luminal cancer involvement at the time of perforation. The overall hospitalization rate related to perforation was 95.5%, with mortality of 15.5% during the same admission. Antibiotics were given in 95% of our sample; 37.8% of patients also required surgical/interventional radiology intervention. Forty-six patients (51.1%) had perforation-related complications (for example, sepsis, fistula, abscess), which were associated with a higher mortality rate (30%).ConclusionOur findings suggest a low incidence of bowel perforation after ICI treatment (0.6%), with 40% of patients having coexisting bowel inflammation as a potential contributing factor. Patients with bowel perforation had an aggressive disease course and high rates of hospitalization, complications, and mortality. Early recognition and prompt intervention is critical to improve patient outcomes. Future studies are warranted to further investigate the cause, predictive markers, and optimal treatment for this patient population.",1
"AbstractBackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review synthesises all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making. It updates the previous version of the review, published in 2018.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both on overall survival, severe or life‐threatening adverse events, and quality of life in people undergoing first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.Search methodsWe searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CANCERLIT, and handsearched various sources for additional studies. The latest search dates were in March and July 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both with another intervention or best supportive care. Participants were required to have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer not amenable to curative intent treatment. Histological confirmation was required. Trials were required to report overall survival.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.Main resultsWe included 75 studies in the review and 51 in the meta‐analysis (11,333 participants). We divided the studies into seven categories: any anti‐cancer treatment versus best supportive care; various chemotherapy types versus gemcitabine; gemcitabine‐based combinations versus gemcitabine alone; various chemotherapy combinations versus gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel; fluoropyrimidine‐based studies; miscellaneous studies; and radiotherapy studies. In general, the included studies were at low risk for random sequence generation, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias, at unclear risk for allocation concealment, and high risk for performance bias.Compared to best supportive care, chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.33; absolute risk of death at 12 months of 971 per 1000 versus 962 per 1000; 4 studies, 298 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The adverse effects of chemotherapy and impacts on quality of life (QoL) were uncertain. Many of the chemotherapy regimens were outdated.Eight studies compared non‐gemcitabine‐based chemotherapy regimens to gemcitabine. These showed that 5‐fluorouracil (5FU) likely reduces OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27; risk of death at 12 months of 914 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 1 study, 126 participants; moderate certainty), and grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). Fixed dose rate gemcitabine likely improves OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; risk of death at 12 months of 683 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 644 participants; moderate certainty), and likely increase grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). FOLFIRINOX improves OS (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60; risk of death at 12 months of 524 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 652 participants; high certainty), and delays deterioration in QoL, but increases grade 3/4 adverse events.Twenty‐eight studies compared gemcitabine‐based combinations to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine plus platinum may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; risk of death at 12 months of 745 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 6 studies, 1140 participants; low certainty), may increase grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely worsens QoL. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improves OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; risk of death at 12 months of 722 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 10 studies, 2718 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely improves QoL. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitors result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; risk of death at 12 months of 770 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 3 studies, 839 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely does not alter QoL. Gemcitabine plus taxane result in a large improvement in OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; risk of death at 12 months of 644 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 986 participants; high certainty), and likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events and improves QoL.Nine studies compared chemotherapy combinations to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combination regimens improve OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; risk of death at 12 months of 542 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 6 studies, 1285 participants; high certainty). The treatment arms had distinct toxicity profiles, and there was little to no difference in QoL. Alternative schedules of gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel likely result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.47; risk of death at 12 months of 663 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 2 studies, 367 participants; moderate certainty) or QoL, but may increase grade 3/4 adverse events.Four studies compared fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations to fluoropyrimidines alone, with poor quality evidence. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations are likely to result in little to no impact on OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.15; risk of death at 12 months of 765 per 1000 versus 704 per 1000; P = 0.27; 4 studies, 491 participants; moderate certainty) versus fluoropyrimidines alone. The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in grade 3/4 adverse events or QoL between the two groups.We included only one radiotherapy (iodine‐125 brachytherapy) study with 165 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of radiotherapy on outcomes.Authors' conclusionsCombination chemotherapy remains standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus a taxane improve OS compared to gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that fluoropyrimidine‐based combination chemotherapy regimens improve OS compared to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. The effects of radiotherapy were uncertain as only one low‐quality trial was included. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individuals still remains unpersonalised, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to assist in rationalising treatment selection for patients.","ObjectiveTo investigate the value of gemcitabine and pirarubicin in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).Methods405 patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer admitted to our hospital from January 2012 to December 2020 who underwent transurethral bladder tumor electronic resection were studied. 177 patients were treated with gemcitabine (Gemcitabine group) and 228 patients were treated with pirarubicin (Pirarubicin group) after surgery. The efficacy and adverse effects of the two groups were observed and the patients were followed up.ResultsNo differences were found when comparing age, gender, smoking, bladder mass, number of masses, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hematuria and tumor diameter between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). In the Gemcitabine group, bladder irritation signs, meatus hematuria, fever, nausea and vomiting were lower than those in the Pirarubicin group (P < 0.05). The recurrence rates were 6.21% and 12.28% at 1 year, 11.86% and 23.68% at 2 years, 15.82% and 25.88% at 3 years in the Gemcitabine and Pirarubicin groups respectively, with the Gemcitabine group having a significantly lower recurrence rate than the Pirarubicin group (P < 0.05). The tumor recurrence-free survival rate for 5 years of gemcitabine was significantly higher than that of the Pirarubicin group (P < 0.05).ConclusionGemcitabine and pirarubicin are both effective in treating patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, with gemcitabine having a lower incidence of adverse reactions, a higher safety rating, a lower recurrence rate and an improved survival outcome.",1
"AbstractBackground:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subsequent radiotherapy (RT) following first-line treatment with durvalumab plus chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).Methods:A total of 122 patients with ES-SCLC from three hospitals during July 2019 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was performed to address potential confounding factors. The primary focus of our evaluation was to assess the impact of RT on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:After IPTW analysis, 49 patients received durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide (EP) chemotherapy followed by RT (Durva + EP + RT) and 72 patients received immunochemotherapy (Durva + EP). The median OS was 17.2 months vs. 12.3 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17–0.85, P = 0.020), and the median PFS was 8.9 months vs. 5.9 months (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32–0.97, P = 0.030) in Durva + EP + RT and Durva + EP groups, respectively. Thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) resulted in longer OS (17.2 months vs. 14.7 months) and PFS (9.1 months vs. 7.2 months) compared to RT directed to other metastatic sites. Among patients with oligo-metastasis, RT also showed significant benefits, with a median OS of 17.4 months vs. 13.7 months and median PFS of 9.8 months vs. 5.9 months compared to no RT. Continuous durvalumab treatment beyond progression (TBP) prolonged OS compared to patients without TBP, in both the Durva + EP + RT (NA vs. 15.8 months, HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.14–1.63, P = 0.238) and Durva + EP groups (12.3 months vs. 4.3 months, HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10–0.81, P = 0.018). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 13 (26.5%) and 13 (18.1%) patients, respectively, in the two groups; pneumonitis was mostly low-grade.Conclusion:Addition of RT after first-line immunochemotherapy significantly improved survival outcomes with manageable toxicity in ES-SCLC.","PurposeOncolytic virotherapy is emerging as an important modality in cancer treatment. In a previous study, we designed and constructed Ad-Apoptin-hTERTp-E1a (Ad-VT), a dual cancer-selective anti-tumor recombinant adenovirus.MethodsTo explore the therapeutic effect of recombinant adenovirus Ad-VT together with Etoposide on small cell lung cancer, the ability of Ad-VT alone, Etoposide alone, and a combination of Ad-VT + Etoposide to inhibit proliferation of NCI-H446 and BEAS-2B cells was investigated using the WST-1 method. According to the inhibitory action of different combinations, a combination index (CI) was estimated by CalcuSyn software to select the best combination. The inhibitory effect of Ad-VT combined with Etoposide on NCI-H446 and BEAS-2B cells was detected by crystal violet staining and the CFST method. Hoechst, Annexin V and JC-1 staining were used to explore the inhibitory pathway of Ad-VT combined with Etoposide on NCI-H446 cells. The migratory and invasive abilities of treated NCI-H446 cells were assessed by Transwell and BioCat methods. Tumor volume, body weight and survival rate were measured to analyze the anti-tumor and toxic effects of different treatments in tumor-bearing mice.ResultsAd-VT (20 MOI) combined with Etoposide (400 nM) significantly inhibited NCI-H446 cell proliferation with reduced toxicity of Etoposide to normal cells. Ad-VT induced apoptosis of NCI-H446 cells mainly through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, an effect significantly increased by the combined treatment. Ad-VT together with Etoposide significantly inhibited migration and invasion of NCI-H446 cells, inhibited tumor growth in vivo and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice.ConclusionsThe above results indicate that when combined with Etoposide, Ad-VT may have an important role in synergistically inhibiting tumors.",1
"AbstractBackgroundAs an extended analysis of the COVID-DELAY study, we aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnosis, staging, and survival outcomes among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis performed from 2019 to 2022.MethodsAll consecutive newly diagnosed CRC patients referred to 11 Italian Oncology Departments between March and December 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 were enrolled. Access rate, demographics, diagnostic-therapeutic temporal intervals, and first-line progression-free survival (PFS) and OS among metastatic patients were assessed.ResultsCompared to 2019 (n = 690), an initial global reduction in new CRC cases in 2020 (n = 564, –18.3%) was observed, followed by a progressive increase in new CRC diagnoses in 2021 (n = 748, + 8.4%) and 2022 (n = 756, + 9.6%); a higher rate of TNM stage IV tumors was diagnosed in 2020 (35.4%) and 2021 (31.0%) compared to 2019 (29.6%), with normalization in 2022 (26.4%) (P < .001). Not clinically relevant differences between histological diagnosis and first oncological examination, cytohistological diagnosis and systemic treatment start, first oncological appointment and systemic treatment start, treatment start and first radiological assessment between 2020 and 2021-2022 years were found. After propensity score matching according to the year of diagnosis, median OS was significantly worse in 2020, 2021, and 2022 compared to 2019 (27.6 vs 24.8 vs not reached vs 38.9 months, respectively) (P < .001). Concordantly, the median PFS was significantly worse with each passing year: 13.0 vs 11.1 vs 9.2 vs 7.2 months in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively (P = .00027).ConclusionsA progressive normalization in the rate of new CRC diagnosis as well as TNM stages at diagnosis, in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2020 and 2019, was found. The increase in new CRC cases might have affected some diagnostic-therapeutic time intervals in 2021-2022 years compared to 2020. Significantly, compared to the pre-pandemic phase, pandemic years were independently associated with worse PFS and OS outcomes in patients affected by metastatic disease.","Aim: This study investigated the role of lncRNA LINC01232 in ferroptosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials & methods: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blot experiments were performed to examine relevant mRNAs and proteins expression. The kit assays evaluated malondialdehyde, iron, Fe2+ and glutathione levels. ROS levels were verified by flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation analysis monitored the correlation among LINC01232, H3K27ac, p300 and ARNTL2.Results: LINC01232 or ARNTL2 knockdown facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis. The interaction between LINC01232 and p300 resulted in the enhancement of H3K27ac levels at ARNTL2 promoter to promote ARNTL2 transcriptional activity. ARNTL2 overexpression reversed the promoting effect of LINC01232 knockdown on ferroptosis.Conclusion: LINC01232 inhibited the ferroptosis in CRC by epigenetically upregulating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL2.",1
"Despite the use of various therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T), the prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still generally poor. However, immunotherapy is currently a hot topic in the treatment of hematological tumors. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) via CD39, and ADP can be converted to adenosine via CD73, which can bind to P1 and P2 receptors to exert immunomodulatory effects. Research on the mechanism of the purinergic signaling pathway can provide a new direction for the treatment of AML, and inhibitors of this signaling pathway have been discovered by several researchers and gradually applied in the clinic. In this paper, the mechanism of the purinergic signaling pathway and its clinical application are described, revealing a new target for the treatment of AML and subsequent improvement in patient prognosis.","PurposeTo investigate the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL).MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 410 NKTCL patients admitted to our lymphoma center from 2000 to 2019. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method, and the differences between the study groups were compared by the log-rank test.ResultsThe median age of the 410 patients was 44 (range 8–84), and the 5-year OS and PFS were 61.2% and 38.4%, respectively. For patients with stage I/II, the 5-year PFS rate was 57.5%, and the 5-year OS rate was 77.2%. For patients with stage III/IV, the 5-year PFS rate was 17.4%, and the 5-year OS rate was 43.7%. Compared to the patients who received radiotherapy alone or chemotherapy alone as their initial treatment, the patients who received combined chemoradiotherapy had longer PFS (P = 0.013). Independent prognostic factors for OS were stage III/IV (P = 0.001), elevated IPI/aaIPI score (P = 0.019), elevated PINK score (P < 0.001) and elevated plasma EBV-DNA (P = 0.003). An elevated PINK score (P < 0.001) was an independent prognostic factor for PFS.ConclusionStage III/IV, elevated IPI/aaIPI score, elevated PINK score and elevated plasma EBV-DNA were independent prognostic factors for OS. Elevated PINK score was an independent prognostic factor for PFS. In stage III/IV patients, the patients who received combined chemoradiotherapy had significantly longer PFS.",0
"BackgroundPatients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) with venous tumor thrombus have a poor prognosis, high surgical risk, and lack of targeted therapeutic agents.MethodsGenes with consistent differential expression trends in tumor tissues and VTT groups were first screened, and then differential genes associated with disulfidptosis were found by correlation analysis. Subsequently, identifying ccRCC subtypes and constructing risk models to compare the differences in prognosis and the tumor microenvironment in different subgroups. Finally, constructing a nomogram to predict the prognosis of ccRCC and validate key gene expression levels in cells and tissues.ResultsWe screened 35 differential genes related to disulfidptosis and identified 4 ccRCC subtypes. Risk models were constructed based on the 13 genes, and the high-risk group had a higher abundance of immune cell infiltration, tumor mutational load, and microsatellite instability scores, predicting high sensitivity to immunotherapy. The 1-year AUC = 0.869 for predicting OS by nomogram has a high application value. The expression level of the key gene AJAP1 was low in both tumor cell lines and cancer tissues.ConclusionsOur study not only constructed an accurate prognostic nomogram for ccRCC patients but also identified an AJAP1 biomarker as a potential biomarker for the disease.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04877-x.","ObjectiveOvarian cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest mortality rate in the female reproductive system, enormous socio-economic burden, and limited effective drug therapy. There is an urgent need to find novel effective drugs for ovarian cancer therapy. Our previous in vitro studies demonstrate that ivermectin effectively inhibits ovarian cancer cells and affects energy metabolism pathways. This study aims to clarify in vivo mechanisms and therapeutic targets of ivermectin in the treatment of ovarian cancer to establish predictive biomarkers, guide personalized treatments, and improve preventive strategies in the framework of 3P medicine.MethodsA TOV-21G tumor-bearing mouse model was constructed based on histopathological data and biochemical parameters. TMT-based proteomic analysis was performed on tumor tissues from the different treatment groups. All significantly differentially abundant proteins were characterized by hierarchical clustering, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. In addition, the data were integrated and analyzed with the proteomic data of clinical ovarian cancer tissues from our previous study and the proteomic data of ivermectin intervention in ovarian cancer cells to identify key regulators of ivermectin.ResultsIvermectin (10 mg/kg) had a significant anti-ovarian cancer effect in mice, with a tumor inhibitory rate of 61.5%. Molecular changes in tumor tissue of ivermectin-treated mice were established, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis showed that the main differential pathway networks included the TCA cycle, propanoate metabolism, 2-0xocarboxyacid metabolism, and other pathways. Integrating our previous clinical ovarian cancer tissue and cell experimental data, this study found that ivermectin significantly interfered with the energy metabolic pathways of ovarian cancer, including glycolysis, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and other related pathways.ConclusionsThis study evaluated the anti-ovarian cancer effect in vitro and in vivo, and its specific regulatory effect on energy metabolism. The expressions of drug target molecules in the energy metabolism pathway of ovarian cancer will be used to guide the diagnosis and prevention of ovarian cancer. The significant efficacy of ivermectin will be applied to the treatment of ovarian cancer and personalized medication. This has guiding significance for the clinical diagnosis, treatment, personalized medication, and prognosis evaluation of ovarian cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-024-00385-1.",0
"Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) serves a key immunosuppressive role as a negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. HPK1 loss-of-function is associated with augmentation of immune function and has demonstrated synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in syngeneic mouse cancer models. These data offer compelling evidence for the use of selective small molecule inhibitors of HPK1 in cancer immunotherapy. We identified a novel series of isoquinoline HPK1 inhibitors through fragment-based screening that displayed promising levels of biochemical potency and activity in functional cell-based assays. We used structure-based drug design to introduce key selectivity elements while simultaneously addressing pharmacokinetic liabilities. These efforts culminated in a molecule demonstrating subnanomolar biochemical inhibition of HPK1 and strong in vitro augmentation of TCR signaling in primary human T-cells. Further profiling of this molecule revealed excellent kinase selectivity (347/356 kinases <50% inhibition @ 0.1 μM), a favorable in vitro safety profile, and good projected human pharmacokinetics.","PurposesIncreased number of studies reveal the crucial role of the Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway in anti-tumor immunity. In this study, we aim to explore the effect of cGAS/STING on tumor immune microenvironment of melanoma after carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and the underlying mechanism.MethodsC57BL/6 mouse tumor models were used to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments (X-ray, carbon ion, PD-L1 inhibitor and combination therapies) on tumor growth and process. Mass cytometry was performed to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). DNA damage response (DDR) and cGAS/STING pathway were investigated by immunofluorescence-co-localization assays, γ-H2AX, P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), Breast Cancer 1 (BRCA1), and cGAS measurements.ResultsCarbon ion irradiation caused more DNA damages and cGAS–STING pathway activation compared with X-ray irradiation, and the former slowed the melanoma growth in syngeneic model. Although X-ray irradiation is not sensitive for melanoma treatment, carbon ion irradiation showed a significant anti-tumor effect for melanoma treatment. TILs analysis revealed that CIRT boosted the infiltration of natural killer (NK), CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, meanwhile increased the number of immune checkpoint (programmed death-1, PD-1, lymphocyte activation gene 3, LAG-3 and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3, TIM-3). Moreover, CIRT increased PD-L1 exposure on cell surface compared with X-ray group. Furthermore, CIRT combined with PD-L1 inhibitor therapy increased the number of T cells and NK cells in melanoma, and slowed the growth of melanoma compared with other therapies.ConclusionsOur findings showed that CIRT displayed biological effects by increasing DNA damages of tumor cells and improving immunity in melanoma, which indicated that CIRT might be a potential synergetic treatment for radiotherapy and radioimmunotherapy in melanoma patients. Our works put forward a new insight to provide an effective strategy for melanoma therapy. These findings may help in the design of strategies on melanoma in clinical studies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04577-6.",0
"Multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) can be achieved using different commercially available platforms, often making use of conjugated antibodies detected in iterative cycles. A growing portfolio of pre-conjugated antibodies is offered by the providers, as well as the possibility for in-house conjugation. For many conjugation methods and kits, there are limitations in which antibodies can be used, and conjugation results are sometimes irreproducible. The conjugation process can limit or slow down the progress of studies requiring conjugation of essential markers needed for a given project. Here, we demonstrate a protocol combining manual indirect immunofluorescence (IF) of primary antibodies, followed by antibody elution and staining with multiplexed panels of commercially pre-conjugated antibodies on the PhenoCycler platform. We present detailed protocols for applying the workflow on fresh frozen and formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. We also provide a ready to use workflow for coregistration of the images and demonstrate this for two examples.","Selective RNA delivery is required for the broad implementation of RNA clinical applications, including prophylactic and therapeutic vaccinations, immunotherapies for cancer, and genome editing. Current polyanion delivery relies heavily on cationic amines, while cationic guanidinium systems have received limited attention due in part to their strong polyanion association, which impedes intracellular polyanion release. Here, we disclose a general solution to this problem in which cationic guanidinium groups are used to form stable RNA complexes upon formulation but at physiological pH undergo a novel charge-neutralization process, resulting in RNA release. This new delivery system consists of guanidinylated serinol moieties incorporated into a charge-altering releasable transporter (GSer-CARTs). Significantly, systematic variations in structure and formulation resulted in GSer-CARTs that exhibit highly selective mRNA delivery to the lung (∼97%) and spleen (∼98%) without targeting ligands. Illustrative of their breadth and translational potential, GSer-CARTs deliver circRNA, providing the basis for a cancer vaccination strategy, which in a murine model resulted in antigen-specific immune responses and effective suppression of established tumors.",0
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent form of gastrointestinal malignancy with challenges in chemotherapy resistance and side effects. Effective and low toxic drugs for CRC treatment are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death, which has garnered attention for its therapeutic potential against cancer. Baicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is the primary flavone extracted from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis that exhibits anticancer effects against several malignancies including CRC. In this study, we investigated whether baicalein induced ferroptosis in CRC cells. We showed that baicalein (1–64 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of human CRC lines HCT116 and DLD1. Co-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (1 μM) significantly mitigated baicalein-induced CRC cell death, whereas autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (25 μM), necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (10 μM), or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (10 μM) did not rescue baicalein-induced CRC cell death. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the inhibitory effect of baicalein on CRC cells is associated with ferroptosis induction. We revealed that baicalein (7.5–30 μM) dose-dependently decreased the expression levels of GPX4, key regulator of ferroptosis, in HCT116 and DLD1 cells by blocking janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway via direct interaction with JAK2, ultimately leading to ferroptosis in CRC cells. In a CRC xenograft mouse model, administration of baicalein (10, 20 mg/kg, i.g., every two days for two weeks) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth with significant ferroptosis induced by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 axis in tumor tissue. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis contributes to baicalein-induced anti-CRC activity through blockade of the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 signaling pathway, which provides evidence for the therapeutic application of baicalein against CRC.","BackgroundThe m6A methylation modification is one of the most common mRNA modifications, and involved in a variety of biological processes, such as cell death, cancer stem cell formation and tumorigenesis. Increasing evidences have demonstrated that the expression patterns of m6A regulators are significantly correlated with PD-L1 level some solid tumors, but few study has explored the function of m6A regulators in the immune microenvironment and prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsSurvival analysis was independently conducted for 20 m6A regulators to explore their prognostic value in NSCLC, and then the prognostic risk model based on m6A regulator expression profiles is built to stratify NSCLC patients. Also, the correlation analysis between immune infiltrating cells and m6A regulators is used to reveal the impact of m6A on immune microenvironment of NSCLC. Furthermore, to explore the function of m6A as biomarker of anit-PD-L1 therapeutic effect, we explored the associations of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1 levels to 20 m6A regulator expression patterns in NSCLC.ResultsFirst, the expressions of 20 m6A regulators in NSCLC tissues were significantly increased compared to normal tissues. Survival analysis revealed that three genes, METTL3, HNRNPC and VIRMA, were markedly correlated to the prognosis of NSCLC patients. In particular, cox regression analysis verified that METTL3 could be used as an independent prognostic factor to predict the survival rate of NSCLC patients. Second, the risk prognostic model built on seven m6A regulators can effectively stratify NSCLC patients, and the low-risk subgroup had better prognosis compared to high-risk group. Finally, a few m6A regulators showed significant associations with immune microenvironment, as well as TMB and PD-L1 level, suggesting that the m6A RNA methylation is indicative of therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 treatment.ConclusionOur study identified some m6A regulatory factors as independent risk factors for the prognosis of NSCLC, and the expression patterns of m6A regulators are also correlated to the immune infiltration, as well as TMB and PD-L1 level in NSCLC. The m6A regulators could be used as biomarkers indicative of immunotherapy to NSCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04032-y.",0
"ABSTRACTEpithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a member of the small hydrophobic membrane protein subfamily. EMP1 is aberrantly expressed in various tumor tissues and governs multiple cellular behaviors (for example, proliferation, differentiation, and migration). The resultant regulation of the cancer pathway is responsible for the metastasis of cancer cells and determines the risk of malignant tumor progression. This review provides an updated overview of EMP1 as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor contingent on the cancer type and summarizes its upstream regulators and downstream target genes. This systematic review summarizes our current understanding of the role of EMP1 in malignant tumor development, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for its potential use as the biomarker and therapeutic target.","Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies are emerging in the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as the dominant ablative approach as an alternative to surgery for primary breast cancer in patients who do not wish to have surgery or are poor surgical candidates. Cryoablation is well tolerated and provides excellent local control and cosmesis. Thermal ablation may also be used in the treatment of oligometastatic breast cancer, allowing patients to achieve long disease-free intervals. Transarterial therapies have been studied in the treatment of oligoprogressive hepatic metastasis, though further supportive data would be helpful to demonstrate its efficacy.",1
"Increasing evidence indicates that Calumenin (CALU), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is significantly associated with tumor progression. However, the effect of CALU on patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unknown. By integrating multi-omics data and molecular biology experiments, we found that CALU expression was significantly increased in tumors compared with normal tissues, and the pathological grade and prognosis of patients were correlated with CALU expression. Next, knockdown or ectopic expression of CALU could affect the proliferative and invasive abilities of ccRCC cells. Moreover, immune landscape characterization revealed that CALU expression was positively associated with neutrophils and macrophages, whereas it was negatively associated with natural killer T cells and CD8+ T cells. Single-cell sequencing showed that the localization and binding targets of CALU mainly involved monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Sensitivity analysis of common chemotherapeutic drugs showed that high expression of CALU could sensitize chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol, AMG-706 and Cytarabine, but could lead to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as Embelin, Salubrinal and Tipifarnib. We demonstrated a significant correlation between high CALU expression and poor patient survival. Further, we demonstrated a correlation between CALU expression, tumor microenvironment, and the sensitivity of patients to common chemo- and immuno-therapy drugs. Thus, our results indicate that CALU could be a biomarker and designing personalized treatment approaches for ccRCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00169-7.","BackgroundDespite great advances in its early diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer is still an intractable disease and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and morbidity in the world. The family of Polo-like kinases (PLKs) consists of five serine/threonine kinases, which have been reported to participate in various human diseases. However, the expression and prognostic value of each PLK in human lung cancer have not been fully understood. This study analyzed mRNA expression and prognostic value of different PLKs in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsFirst, mRNA expression of PLKs in patients with NSCLC from the Oncomine and the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database was investigated. Then, a Kaplan–Meier plotter was employed for survival analysis. The sequence alteration for PLKs was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the cBioPortal database. Additionally, we analyzed the association among different PLKs using the LinkedOmics database. Finally, the enrichment analysis of PLKs was achieved using the DAVID database.ResultsThe mRNA expression levels of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly overexpressed, while mRNA expression level of PLK3 was underexpressed in patients with NSCLC. mRNA expressions of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly and positively related to the tumor stage of NSCLC. Increased expressions of PLK1, PLK4, and PLK5 and decreased expression of PLK2 were attributed to limited overall survival time in NSCLC. PLK1 was positively correlated with PLK4 via the LinkedOmics database.ConclusionsPLKs are relevant targets for NSCLC treatment, especially PLK1 and PLK4.",1
"ABSTRACTCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a powerful measure of minimal residual disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although immunotherapy has been widely established in metastatic CRC that is mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H), its role in non-metastatic CRC is rapidly evolving. In resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage II CRC, adjuvant fluoropyrimidine has no benefit and is not recommended. There is growing evidence to suggest diminished benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation in localized CRC that is dMMR/MSI-H. We present two cases of dMMR/MSI-H stage III CRC treated with definitive surgery wherein adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy led to a failure to clear postoperative plasma ctDNA levels, prompting a change to immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab and resultant ctDNA clearance. We illustrate that chemotherapy may achieve suboptimal disease control in localized colon cancer that is dMMR/MSI-H, while plasma ctDNA offers a window of opportunity to gauge the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy to clear microscopic disease in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer. These findings are important to contextualize given that relapse is inevitable with failure to clear MRD in the postoperative stage I-III CRC setting whereby chemotherapy remains the standard adjuvant therapy in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer.","PurposeThis study aimed to explore the clinical implications of ctDNA for epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) as the first-line treatment in EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in real-world settings.MethodsA total of 122 patients with NSCLC who underwent tissue and liquid next generation sequencing (NGS) tests were included. 66 patients with detected EGFR mutation in both tumor-tissue and plasma were included into the EGFRt+, p+ group, and 56 patients with EGFR mutation detected only in tumor-tissue were included into the EGFRt+, p− group. The differences in clinical characteristics, concomitant mutations and prognosis between the two groups were compared.ResultsThe detection rate of the EGFRt+, p+ group was 54.1% (66/122). EGFRt+, p+ in the NGS test was particularly relevant to the size of tumors, liver metastasis, bone metastasis and TP53 mutation. In patients with TP53 mutation in ctDNA, the detection rate of EGFR mutation in ctDNA was up to 91.3%. EGFRt+, p+ could be an independent prognostic factor for first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment. Combination therapy seems to be a promising approach to improve the outcome for EGFRt+, p+ (P = 0.017, HR 0.509 [95% CI 0.288–0.897]). Moreover, the combination of TP53 mutated status and EGFRm status in plasma showed a better completion of risk stratification for PFS (Log-rank P < 0.001).ConclusionsCo-detection of EGFR mutation in tumor tissue and plasma is an independent prognostic factor for first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment. Moreover, combination therapy could be a promising approach to improve the outcome for these patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03952-z.",1
"SummaryPathologists play a central role in RCC patient care by confirming the diagnosis of malignancy, determining the histologic type of RCC, and assessing many important prognostic factors such as the pathological stage, nuclear grade, presence of sarcomatoid or rhabdoid features, and others. In recent years, our increased understanding of the molecular alterations driving specific RCC types has led to an improved classification scheme that better informs patient prognosis and treatment. In spite of this progress, no predictive biomarkers are currently approved for the management of patients with RCC. Pathologists are uniquely positioned to move the field forward by developing IHC/mIF-based predictors of outcome to ICI-based therapy that could be utilized in the clinic.","AbstractOvarian cancer (OC), with its high mortality rate among gynecological cancers, is often diagnosed late due to the lack of early diagnostic symptoms and biomarkers. The tumor immune microenvironment has become a focal point in cancer diagnostic and therapeutic research. Among these, B7-H4, a checkpoint protein, plays a crucial role in immune regulation and tumor suppression, contributing to immune evasion within the tumor microenvironment. This study aims to identify the concentration of soluble B7-H4(sB7-H4) in the plasma of patients with OC and to evaluate its clinical significance. Through a comprehensive analysis involving enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and multicolor immunofluorescence, we quantified sB7-H4 levels in patient plasma and ascites, correlating these findings with tissue expression and clinical outcomes. Results indicated a strong association between high sB7-H4 levels and advanced disease, surgical outcomes, lymphatic metastasis, and platinum resistance. When compared with traditional biomarkers CA125 and HE4, sB7-H4, especially in conjunction with these markers, enhances the diagnostic accuracy for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), offering insights into disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. This comprehensive analysis suggests that sB7-H4 is a promising biomarker for EOC, providing valuable insights into diagnosis, stage differentiation, treatment effectiveness, and prognosis.",1
"The present study reports the development of a novel nanoconjugate, NG-FACD, comprising a positively charged self-assembled nanogel (NG) derived from a peptide amphiphilic hydrogelator and a negatively charged folic acid-functionalized blue-emitting carbon dot (FACD), bound via electrostatic interactions. NG-FACD was developed to combine the advantages of the individual nanocarriers and overcome their drawbacks. The presence of folic acid enables NG-FACD to be successfully used in selective bioimaging and targeted combination therapy against folate receptor-positive (FR+) B16F10 over FR– cells. NG-FACD demonstrated improved riboflavin (RbF) and paclitaxel (PTX) loading compared to individual nanocarriers that made it ∼1.8- and 1.5-fold more cytotoxic toward FR+ B16F10 cells over RbF- and PTX-loaded individual nanocarriers. The concurrent presence of RbF and PTX on NG-FACD displayed ∼1.9–2.8-fold higher cytotoxicity than single drug-loaded individual nanocarriers and ∼3–4.5-fold higher cytotoxicity through RbF-mediated photodynamic therapy and PTX-induced chemotherapy in synergy compared to free drugs against FR+ B16F10 cells.","PurposeThis phase II trial is designed to test whether the performance status (PS) of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients (pts) can improve with chemotherapy if their poor PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of ≥ 2) is due to disease burden rather than comorbidities.MethodsAge18–65 years, Charlson’s comorbidity index < 9, serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dl, adequate bone marrow and organ function, & ECOG PS ≥ 2 as judged by the worst score of three independent physicians were administered 3 doses of weekly paclitaxel at 60 mg/m2/dose. The primary endpoint was an improvement in ECOG PS by 1 point at 4 weeks; others: toxicity (CTCAE v 5.0), quality of life (QoL) assessment at baseline and 4 weeks by EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13. Optimal Simon’s 2-stage design was used.Results Forty-six patients were included with a median age of 56 years (interquartile range, IQR 54–59), 12 (26%) had comorbid conditions, and 87% with ECOG PS 3/4. PS improved in 11 pts at 4 weeks and in 7 beyond this time point. Grade 3/4 toxicities are seen in 20% (most common: anemia and diarrhea). At a median follow-up of 4.8 m (95% CI 3.27–14.9), the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.3 months (95% CI 2.36–5.6) and 6.8 months (95% CI 2.47–8.8), respectively. QoL improved for global QoL, role functioning, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, pain in the chest, pain in other parts, and worsened for alopecia and sore mouth.Conclusions Abbreviated chemotherapy is a useful, well-tolerated strategy in carefully selected poor PS mNSCLC patients that can improve PS and QoL.Clinical trialClinical trial information: CTRI/2020/01/022617.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04617-1.",1
"Introduction:Glioblastoma patients have a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and systemic immunosuppression that comprise a major barrier to immune checkpoint therapy. Based on the production of endocannabinoids by glioblastomas, we explored involvement of endocannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), encoded by the CNR2 gene, which is predominantly expressed by immune cells, in glioblastoma-related immunosuppression.Materials & Methods:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases was used to correlate enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, as well as CB2Rs, with patient overall survival. Intrastriatal administration of luciferase-expressing, murine GL261 glioblastoma cells was used to establish in in vivo glioblastoma model for characterization of tumor growth and intratumoral immune cell infiltration, as well as provide immune cells for in vitro co-culture experiments. Involvement of CB2Rs was determined by treatment with CB2R agonist (GW405833) or CB2R antagonist (AM630). ELISA, FACS, and immunocytochemistry were used to determine perforin, granzyme B, and surface marker levels.Results:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases showed high expression of CB2R and elevated endocannabinoid production correlated with poorer prognosis, and involved immune-associated pathways. AM630treatment of GL261 glioblastoma-bearing mice induced a potent antitumor response, with survival plateauing at 50% on Day 40, when all control mice (median survival 28 days) and mice treated with GW405833 (median survival 21 days) had died. Luciferase tumor imaging revealed accelerated tumor growth by GW405833 treatment, but stable or regressing tumors in AM630-treated mice. Notably, in spleens, AM630 treatment caused an 83% decrease in monocytes/macrophages, and 1.8- and 1.6-fold increases in CD8+ and CD4+ cells, respectively. Within tumors, there was a corresponding decrease in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increase in CD8+ T cells. In vitro, lymphocytes from AM630-treated mice showed greater cytotoxic function (increased percentage of perforin- and granzyme B-positive CD8+ T cells).Discussion:These results suggest that inhibition of CB2R enhances both immunosuppressive TAM infiltration and systemic T-cell suppression through CB2R activation, and that inhibition of CB2Rs can potently counter both the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, as well as systemic immunosuppression in glioblastoma.","AbstractThe respiratory tract with its vast surface area and very thin air-blood tissue barrier presents an extremely large interface for potential interaction with xenobiotics such as inhaled pathogens or medicaments. To protect its large and vulnerable surface, the lung is populated with several different types of immune cells. Pulmonary epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells are key players in shaping the innate and adaptive immune response. Due to their localization, they represent a frontline of cell populations that are among the first to come in contact with inhaled xenobiotics. Furthermore, depending on the lung compartment they populate, these cells show a large variety in morphology, phenotype, and function. These unique characteristics make those cell populations ideal targets for specific immunomodulators that are designed for inhalation. Depending on cell population or lung compartment targeting, a specific immune response may be triggered or modulated. The purpose of a potent carrier for pulmonary immunomodulation is, first, to efficiently target a specific immunocompetent cell and, second, to affect its role in generating an immune response. Immunomodulation may occur at different levels of immune cell-antigen interaction, that is antigen uptake, trafficking, processing and presentation. Inhalation of nanosized carriers for drugs or vaccines shows great potential for both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches in order to modulate immune responses locally or systemically, due to the specific deposition and targeting properties of nanoparticles. Immune responses triggered by nanosized particles may be either immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive and depending on the specific purpose, stimulation or suppression may either be desired or unwanted. Meticulous analysis of immunomodulatory potential, pharmacologic and toxicologic testing of inhalable nanocarriers is required in order to find novel and optimal approaches for prophylaxis and therapy of pulmonary diseases. The design and characterization of such nanoparticles requires well-coordinated interdisciplinary research among engineers, biologists and clinicians.",1
"PD-L1 is a glycoprotein present on antigen-presenting cells and malignant cells and activates the PD-L1 receptor on cells surfaces, leading to T-cell anergy and death. The objective of this study was to assess PD-L1 tumoral expression in 50 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, define its prognostic value, and investigate its association with 2-year overall survival, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, and a number of other clinicopathological parameters. In a 24-month prospective observational study, involving 50 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients, PD-L1 tumoral expression was evaluated using semiquantitative immunohistochemistry analysis by an experienced pathologist. PD-L1 expression of ≥ 6% of tumor cells was associated with poor survival outcome and determined to be a pertinent clinical cutoff value. PD-L1 expression of ≥ 6% was significantly associated with a number of clinicopathological parameters in our study of 50 patients with OSCC. Pathological nodal staging (P = 0.00), lympho-vascular invasion (P = 0.03), extra-nodal extension (P = 0.04), overall staging (P = 0.01), locoregional recurrence (P = 0.00), and distant metastasis (P = 0.00) all showed statistically significant associations. Our study concluded a significant correlation with decreased 2-year overall survival and 2-year disease free survival by using the Kaplan- Meier survival plot for overall survival (p = 0.02) and (p = 0.0002), respectively. The presence of ≥ 6% PD-L1 (CD274) tumoral expression was found to be significantly associated with 2-year overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRC), distant metastasis (DM), and various clinicopathological parameters. Tumoral PD-L1 was found as a discrete prognostic biomarker which showed significant association with tumor aggressiveness.","ObjectiveCellular cannibalism (CC) is a prime metabolic event to determine the aggressive potential of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the etiology and mechanism behind this degradation are still ambiguous. The aim of the study was to explore the etiopathogenetic mechanism behind CC, along with its association with degree of differentiation, angiogenic, phagocytic and antiapoptotic activity in OSCC.DesignSeventy-three tissue sections of various histological grades of OSCC were retrieved from departmental archives and scanned for cannibalistic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using CD31, CD68, and BCL2 was performed. The data obtained were analyzed using Chi-square, Spearman’s correlation test and multiple regression analysis (p < 0.05).ResultsCCs were present significantly in various grades of OSCC (p < 0.00). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant difference in CD68, BCL2 (p < 0.05 in both), and CD31 (p < 0.001) expression with CC. The internalized cells showed positivity for CD68 and negativity for BCL2. Regression analysis revealed that tumor grade, CD31 and BCL2 immunoreactivity were significant predictors of frequency of CC.ConclusionThe association of CC with degree of differentiation, CD31, CD68, and BCL2 expression could predict the biological behavior of OSCC and might serve as a promising histopathological parameter in future.",1
"Background:Immunomodulation is widely invoked to explain possible effects of anesthetic/analgesic drugs on recurrence and survival in cancer patients. By analogy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which enhance anti-tumor actions of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we aim to develop a precision approach to immunomodulation by anesthetic/analgesic drugs. We explore biomarkers predictive of immunotherapy response [tumor mutational burden (TMB)] and resistance [fraction genome altered (FGA)] in relation to anesthetic/analgesic dose to survival response and the expression of drug target receptor genes.Methods:Two local clinical cohorts [lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients] were analyzed retrospectively to yield statistical interactions between drugs, outcomes, and TMB/FGA (extending previously reported results). Bulk tumor gene expression data for solid tumors from 6,488 patients across 18 solid tumor types was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and normalized by tumor type. TMB and FGA for each TCGA patient sample was extracted from cBioPortal. DeSeq was employed to quantify differential gene expression of target receptors of 79 common anesthetic/analgesic drugs for high/low TMB and FGA. Localization of these receptors to specific immune cells was estimated using CIBERSORT.Results:Increased TMB and FGA magnified opioid pro-tumor effects on overall survival in LUAD, while increased TMB reduced ketamine anti-tumor effects on recurrence and did not affect ketorolac anti-tumor effects on recurrence. In COAD, increased TMB (DNA mismatch repair deficiency) magnified opioid anti-tumor effects on recurrence. Drug target receptor gene expression (and immune cell-type specificity) correlated with both TMB and FGA as a function of cancer type.Conclusions:TMB and FGA may have utility as biomarkers predictive of individual cancer patient response to anesthetic/analgesic dose effects on survival due to immunomodulation. Correlation across cancer types of anesthetic/analgesic target receptor gene expression with TMB and FGA and with TME immune cell types suggests molecular/omics level targets for further mechanistic exploration. A precision oncoanalgesia approach in the cancer patient may ultimately be warranted to optimize oncological outcomes.","AbstractBackgroundPrevious results of our trial demonstrated that the addition of induction chemotherapy (IC) prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) failed to significantly improve the response rate or 3-year survival in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here, we report long-term results and exploratory analyses to further evaluate the therapeutic value of IC.MethodsPatients with previously untreated, unresectable, stage II-IVA ESCC were randomly assigned to receive IC followed by CRT or CRT alone. The relationship between tumor response to IC and long-term survival was analyzed. Baseline tumor biopsies were collected for RNA-Seq to identify patients who may benefit from IC.ResultsEligible patients were randomized to either the IC + CRT group (n = 55) or the CRT group (n = 55). With a median follow-up of 74.9 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 31.8% in the IC + CRT group and 29.1% in the CRT group (P =.675; HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.58-1.43). Similarly, no significant differences were identified in 5-year progression-free survival between groups (30.5% vs 25.5%, P =.508; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.56-1.34). Patients who responded to IC had significantly better survival than nonresponders. A risk-score model incorporating 6 key genes to predict IC efficacy was also constructed.ConclusionsCompared with definitive CRT alone, the addition of IC before CRT still failed to demonstrate superior survival in patients with unselected ESCC, based on long-term follow-up. However, because IC responders were associated with more favorable survival, potential molecular biomarkers were identified for selection of benefit population from IC.Clinical Trials RegistrationNCT02403531.",0
"Activated anti-oxidation reactions in cells partially diminish the anticancer effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT), significantly hindering efforts to increase the efficacy of PDT. The expression of transcription factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), an important redox-regulated transcription factor, can be downregulated by Nrf2 siRNA, leading to greatly enhanced PDT effects. However, the efficient co-delivery of photosensitizers and siRNAs remains a key problem because these agents are complex to synthesize, exhibit poor biocompatibility and load drugs with a low efficiency. Herein, we designed a carrier–free and extremely simple strategy to co-deliver a photosensitizer and Nrf2 siRNA to cancer cells. In this nanoplatform, an indocyanine green photosensitizer, siRNA and FeⅡ were self-assembled to form a spherical hybrid structure with a uniform size, high loading ratio and adjustable component ratio. The platform can effectively transfer photosensitizers and siRNAs into cells and effectively inhibit tumour growth in vivo. Overall, the self-assembly approach shows great potential for clinical application and provides a simple method to achieve photodynamic therapy and enhanced photothermal therapy.","PurposeThis study was designed to evaluate the role and expression of MEK5 signalling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and to determine the relevance of MEK5 and mTOR signalling in ccRCC.MethodsThe expression of MEK5 was compared between ccRCC and normal tissues using the ONCOMINE and TCGA databases. MEK5 expression was evaluated in 14 human ccRCC samples. CCK8, wound-healing, and clone formation assays were performed to examine the cell proliferation, migration, and clone formation abilities of ccRCC cells treated with MEK5 and the inhibitor BIX02189. Furthermore, Western blotting was performed to verify the regulation and influence of MEK5 on the mTOR signalling pathway. Finally, a murine subcutaneous tumour model was constructed, and the effect and safety of BIX02189 were evaluated in vivo.ResultsThe ONCOMINE and TCGA databases indicated that MEK5 expression in ccRCC was significantly higher than that in normal tissues, which was further confirmed in clinical specimens. MEK5 knockdown markedly inhibited ccRCC cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, whereas MEK5 overexpression resulted in the opposite results. Western blotting revealed that overexpression of MEK5 could further activate the mTOR signalling pathway. Moreover, the MEK5 inhibitor BIX02189 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, induced apoptosis, and effectively inhibited cell migration and clone formation. BIX02189 also showed an excellent antitumor effect and a favourable safety profile in murine models.ConclusionsMEK5 expression was aberrantly increased in ccRCC, which activated the mTOR signalling pathway and regulated cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and clone formation in ccRCC. Targeted inhibition of MEK5 represents a promising new strategy in patients with ccRCC.",0
"AbstractClinical trials using immune checkpoint inhibition(ICI) have traditionally failed in glioblastoma (GBM). Viral mimicry, which augments anti-tumor immune responses and sensitizes response to immunotherapy in other cancers, involves the epigenetic activation of endogenous retroelements (REs). REs are silenced via the HUSH complex and H3K9me3. This process is mediated by ZNF638. We aimed to elucidate the role of viral mimicry in enhancing ICI through epigenetic reprogramming of the HUSH complex. We demonstrated that RE expression among 48 superfamilies inversely correlated with ZNF638 expression in gliomas, based on data from 71 newly-diagnosed GBMs. Using transcriptional deconvolution, we showed ZNF638 negatively correlates with innate antiviral immune response signatures(TLR3)(RTLR3=-0.300,pTLR3=0.00006). We validated these in-silico results in pure glioma cell lines, patient-derived GBM neurospheres, and syngeneic murine models. ZNF638 knockdown induced intracellular RE-mediated dsRNA signaling cascades via RIG-I and TLR3. This knockdown significantly increased PD-L1 expression(p<0.001), reduced H3K9 trimethylation, and enhanced cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation in glioma cell lines. In patient-derived GBM neurospheres, ZNF638 knockdown upregulated immune and antiviral programs. Additionally, knockdown resulted in upregulation of several endogenous repeat elements (Alu, LTR). Single-cell RNA sequencing showed ZNF638 clustering in neural progenitor-like and oligodendrocyte-like cells, with increased retroelement expression in low ZNF638 cells. Tumors with lower ZNF638 expression showed increased CD8+ populations. Bulk RNA sequencing deconvolution revealed that ZNF638 is linked to reduced CD8 and DC infiltration in gliomas (RCD8=-0.202,RDC=-0.198;pCD8=8.79E-06,pDC=1.34E-05). In immunocompetent mice, ZNF638 KO and PD-L1 inhibition significantly improved survival (mOS >50 days, p<0.0001) and reduced tumor volume (p<0.001). Analysis of cohorts from multiple cancer types treated with anti-PD1 therapy demonstrated that ZNF638 expression predicts therapeutic response and overall survival. Our findings suggest that epigenetic reprogramming through HUSH inhibition may potentiate immunotherapy for GBM.","IntroductionPoliovirus receptor (PVR) is a tumor promoter and a regulatory checkpoint that enhances immunosuppression. We investigated PVR expression by applying immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A positive association existed between PVR expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) expression in patients with surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PVR expression is a prognosis predictor of lung adenocarcinoma.PurposeTo investigate the prognostic significance of PVR expression and CTLA4 expression for surgically resected NSCLC.Patients and methodsThe medical records of 108 Chinese patients with primary NSCLC who underwent surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of PVR and CTLA4 were measured through IHC. Clinical characteristics, the association between PVR and CTLA4, and the prognostic significance of PVR were analyzed.ResultsA significant positive association was observed between PVR and CTLA4 expression in NSCLC (P = 0.016). PVR had a high positive rate among females, nonsmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma and advanced lung cancer. The overall survival (OS) of patients with negative PVR expression was significantly longer than that of patients with positive PVR expression (P = 0.049), especially among females (P = 0.03) and nonsmokers (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis results showed that advanced tumor stage and PVR expression were independent prognosis predictors of poor OS.ConclusionPVR can potentially serve as a prognostic predictor and biomarker for NSCLC and cancer anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03189-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"AbstractBackgroundWe examined the relationship between neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cognition in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at baseline and longitudinally.MethodsPlasma and clinical data were available from virally suppressed people with HIV (PWH) aged ≥45 years in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group HAILO study. Four neuropsychological assessments standardized and averaged (NPZ-4) represented cognition. Plasma collection date marked baseline; slope summarized longitudinal NPZ-4 changes. Linear regressions examined biomarkers associations with baseline NPZ-4 and longitudinal change.ResultsThe study included 503 participants with a median age of 52 (interquartile range [IQR, 48–57]) years and observation of 6 (IQR, 5–7) years, and 26% had baseline cognitive impairment defined by HAILO. Cross-sectionally, higher NfL (β = −.76, P < .01) and GFAP (β = −.44, P = .02) were associated with worse NPZ-4. Longitudinally, the median NPZ-4 slope was 0.003 (IQR, −0.06 to 0.06) units/year with 48% demonstrating cognitive decline. Higher NfL (β = −.08, P < .01), but not GFAP (β = −.03, P = .08), was associated with cognitive decline.ConclusionsNfL and GFAP were associated with worse cognition cross-sectionally; only NfL was associated with cognitive decline. Their clinical utility remains uncertain given small effect sizes and should be studied in populations with more rapid decline.","BackgroundAbnormal tau proteins are independent contributors to cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, not all individuals exposed to high-level tau pathology will develop cognitive dysfunction. We aimed to construct a model to predict cognitive trajectory for this high-risk population.MethodLongitudinal data of 181 non-demented adults (mean age= 73.1; female= 45%), who were determined to have high cerebral burden of abnormal tau by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of phosphorylated tau (ptau181) or total tau, were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Cognitive decline was defined as Mini-Mental State Examination scores decline ≥ 3 over three years. A predictive nomogram was constructed using stepwise backward regression method. The discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were evaluated. The model was validated in another 189 non-demented adults via a cross-sectional set (n=149, mean age = 73.9, female = 51%) and a longitudinal set (n= 40, mean age = 75, female = 48%). Finally, the relationships of the calculated risk scores with cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's disease were examined during an extended 8-year follow-up.ResultLower volume of hippocampus (odds ratio [OR] = 0.37, p< 0.001), lower levels of CSF sTREM2 (OR = 0.76, p = 0.003), higher scores of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (OR = 1.15, p = 0.001) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (OR = 1.16, p = 0.016), and number of APOE ε4 (OR = 1.88, p = 0.039) were associated with higher risk of cognitive decline independent of the amyloid status and were included in the final model. The nomogram had an area of under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 for training set, 0.93 for cross-sectional validation set, and 0.91 for longitudinal validation set. Over the 8-year follow-up, the high-risk group exhibited faster cognitive decline (p< 0.001) and a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia (HR= 6.21, 95% CI= 3.61–10.66, p< 0.001).ConclusionAPOE ε4 status, brain reserve capability, neuroinflammatory marker, and neuropsychological scores can help predict cognitive decline in non-demented adults with high burden of tau pathology, independent of the presence of amyloid pathology.",1
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common form of brain cancer. Even with aggressive treatment, tumor recurrence is almost universal and patient prognosis is poor because many GBM cell subpopulations, especially the mesenchymal and glioma stem cell populations, are resistant to temozolomide (TMZ), the most commonly used chemotherapeutic in GBM. For this reason, there is an urgent need for the development of new therapies that can more effectively treat GBM. Several recent studies have indicated that high expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) in GBM is associated with poor patient outcomes. It has been hypothesized that inhibition of the Cx43 hemichannels could prevent TMZ efflux and sensitize otherwise resistance cells to the treatment. In this study, we use a three-dimensional organoid model of GBM to demonstrate that combinatorial treatment with TMZ and αCT1, a Cx43 mimetic peptide, significantly improves treatment efficacy in certain populations of GBM. Confocal imaging was used to visualize changes in Cx43 expression in response to combinatorial treatment. These results indicate that Cx43 inhibition should be pursued further as an improved treatment for GBM.","AbstractOver recent decades, in vitro and in vivo models have significantly advanced brain cancer research; however, each presents distinct challenges for accurately mimicking in situ conditions. In response, organotypic slice cultures have emerged as a promising model recapitulating precisely specific in vivo phenotypes through an ex vivo approach. Ex vivo organotypic brain slice models can integrate biological relevance and patient-specific variability early in drug discovery, thereby aiming for more precise treatment stratification. However, the challenges of obtaining representative fresh brain tissue, ensuring reproducibility, and maintaining essential central nervous system (CNS)-specific conditions reflecting the in situ situation over time have limited the direct application of ex vivo organotypic slice cultures in robust clinical trials. In this review, we explore the benefits and possible limitations of ex vivo organotypic brain slice cultures in neuro-oncological research. Additionally, we share insights from clinical experts in neuro-oncology on how to overcome these current limitations and improve the practical application of organotypic brain slice cultures beyond academic research.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor with significant global health implications. The role of CD4+ T cells, particularly conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), in HCC progression remains unexplored. Furthermore, epigenetic factors are crucial in immune regulation, yet their specific role in HCC-infiltrating Tconv cells remains elusive. This study elucidates the role of MATR3, an epigenetic regulator, in modulating Tconv activity and immune evasion within the HCC microenvironment. Reanalysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed that early activation of CD4+ T cells is crucial for establishing an antitumor immune response. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that Tconv enhances cDC1-induced CD8+ T-cell activation. Screening identified MATR3 as a critical regulator of Tconv function, which is necessary for antitumour activity but harmful when overexpressed. Excessive MATR3 expression exacerbates Tconv exhaustion and impairs function by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to relax chromatin in the TOX promoter region, leading to aberrant transcriptional changes. In summary, MATR3 is an HCC-specific epigenetic checkpoint that bidirectionally regulates Tconv antitumour immunity, suggesting new therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic regulators to enhance antitumour immunity in HCC.","The wide application of increasingly advanced molecular studies in routine clinical practice has allowed a detailed, albeit still incomplete, genetic subclassification of undifferentiated round cell sarcomas. The WHO classification continues to include provisional molecular entities, whose clinicopathological features are in the early stages of evolution. This review focuses on the clinicopathological, molecular, and prognostic features of undifferentiated round cell sarcomas with EWSR1/FUS::NFATC2 or EWSR1::PATZ1 fusions. Classic histopathological findings, uncommon variations, and diagnostic pitfalls are addressed, along with the utility of recently developed immunohistochemical and molecular markers.",0
"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is an antibody-drug conjugate approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Several clinicals trials are investigating InO in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy or other anti-ALL targeted therapies in the salvage and frontline settings, notably in older adults who often cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy and tend to have higher-risk disease. InO is also increasingly used to bridge patients to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), in sequence with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, to eliminate measurable residual disease, and to prevent post-HSCT relapse. Veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) is a potential complication of InO treatment, particularly when followed by HSCT. Herein, we review the historical development and current status of InO, strategies for mitigating InO-related VOD/SOS risk, and future directions for InO research and clinical use.","Plain Language SummaryPatients with both BRAF V600E mutations and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have poor prognosis. Currently, there are no specifically targeted first-line treatment options indicated for patients with mCRC whose tumors harbor both molecular aberrations. Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of MSI-H/dMMR mCRC, and the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib, in combination with cetuximab, is approved for previously treated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. Combination of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab may synergistically enhance antitumor activity in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR mCRC. SEAMARK is a randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab versus pembrolizumab alone in patients with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR mCRC.Plain language summary – SEAMARK study: encorafenib & cetuximab plus pembrolizumab for people with BRAF V600E-mutant & DNA repair-deficient colorectal cancerColorectal cancer (CRC) occurs when there is an abnormal growth of cells (known as a tumor) in the colon or rectum. Some people with CRC have changes in their tumor genes (known as gene mutations). A gene is a piece of DNA that tells the cell to make specific molecules, such as proteins. Mutations in a gene called BRAF can turn on signals that help the cancer cells grow. Gene mutations that impair DNA repair mechanisms can also make the cancer cells grow more quickly and allow the immune system to detect the cancer cells as being foreign to the body. Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that turns off specific genes and proteins involved in cancer cell survival and growth. BRAF and EGFR inhibitors are targeted therapies that work well together in treating people with BRAF-mutant CRC. BRAF proteins can help cancer cells grow, and BRAF inhibitors block these proteins to prevent, slow, or stop the growth of the cancer cells. Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps a person’s immune system fight cancer. Immunotherapy is effective for treating CRC that has mutations in the DNA repair mechanisms. By combining targeted therapy and immunotherapy, patients may be able to live longer without their disease getting worse. In the SEAMARK study, we will use a treatment combination including a BRAF inhibitor (encorafenib), an EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab) and an immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) in patients with CRC who have a BRAF mutation and deficiencies in the DNA repair mechanism.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05217446 (ClinicalTrials.gov), 2021-003715-26 (EudraCT) Tweetable abstract SEAMARK (NCT05217446) is a phase II study investigating the efficacy of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.",1
"PurposePlasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are commonly associated with myeloid malignancies. The association between lymphoblastic leukemia and pDCs has been little explored.Case presentationHere, we report a novel case of early T-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) accompanied by prominent proliferation of blastic pDCs mimicking BPDCN. The diagnosis was established based on a comprehensive analysis of morphology, immunophenotype and clinical implications. We also present a literature review and discussion on the differential expression of reactive and neoplastic pDCs, the functional role of pDCs in lymphoblastic leukemia, and the etiological association of normal pDCs and BPDCN.ConclusionsThe current case demonstrates for the first time that prominent pDC proliferation can be associated with lymphoid neoplasms and can exhibit blastic morphology and immunophenotype. The underlying mechanism of the coexistence of these two blastic populations remains unknown. Further genetic profiling may be required to denote the progressive development of tumor stem cells to the lymphoid, myeloid or dendritic cell lineage. Moreover, the prognostic value of pDCs in hematological neoplasms needs further investigation.","BackgroundLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various cancers, but their roles in endometrial cancer (EC) are largely unknown.MethodsThe expressions of LINC00478 and PTBP1 in EC tissues were determined by RT-qPCR. Cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry and Transwell assays were executed for detecting the roles of LINC00478 in EC cells proliferation, migration and invasion. The mouse–xenograft models were established by subcutaneous injection in vivo. The interaction between LINC00478 and PTBP1 was confirmed by RNA pull-down assay and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay.ResultsLINC00478 was significantly down-regulated in EC tissues while compared to that in their paracancerous samples, and a higher expression level of LINC00478 was negatively correlated with clinical progress of EC patients. Functional experiments in vivo and in vitro revealed that LINC00478 overexpression could dramatically retard the proliferation of EC cells, decrease the rate of colony formation, suppress the migration and invasion abilities of EC cells in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00478 regulated the expression of PTBP1, a key factor in the Warburg effect, and affected the metabolic process of EC cells.ConclusionsLINC00478 acts as a tumor suppressor in EC by negatively controlling PTBP1 expression and influencing the Warburg effect, providing a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with EC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05282-0.",0
"The differential diagnosis for multiple intracranial lesions in a young adult is broad and includes demyelinating, neoplastic, and infectious etiologies. In this report, we describe the case of a 19-year-old immunocompetent woman presenting with progressive headaches and aphasia. MRI of the brain revealed multiple, large supratentorial lesions with concentric bands of alternating T2 signal intensities and peripheral contrast enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was overall bland with negative oligoclonal bands. Serum antibody testing for neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and myelin-oligodendrocyte associated disease (MOGAD) were negative. A broad infectious work-up was also unrevealing. A definitive diagnosis was ultimately obtained after brain biopsy and the patient was started on appropriate therapy. This case highlights a diagnostic framework in evaluating immunocompetent patients presenting with multiple intracranial lesions and progressive neurological decline. The main differential diagnoses for this constellation of radiological and clinical findings are discussed and a literature review is performed on the revealed diagnosis.

"Purpose:Nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg is a nonreplicating adenoviral vector–based gene therapy for bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)–unresponsive carcinoma in situ (CIS) with/without high-grade Ta/T1. We report outcomes following 5 years of planned follow-up.Materials and Methods:This open-label phase 3 trial (NCT02773849) enrolled patients with BCG-unresponsive nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer in 2 cohorts: CIS ± Ta/T1 (CIS; n = 107) and Ta/T1 without CIS (Ta/T1 cohort; n = 50). Patients received 75 mL (3 × 1011 vp/mL) nadofaragene firadenovec intravesically once every 3 months with cystoscopy and cytology assessments, with continued treatment offered to those remaining high grade recurrence–free (HGRF).Results:One hundred fifty-seven patients were enrolled from 33 US sites (n = 151 included in efficacy analyses). Median follow-up was 50.8 months (interquartile range 39.1-60.0), with 27% receiving ≥ 5 instillations and 7.6% receiving treatment for ≥ 57 months. Of patients with CIS 5.8% (95% CI 2.2-12.2) were HGRF at month 57, and 15% (95% CI 6.1-27.8) of patients with high-grade Ta/T1 were HGRF at month 57. Kaplan-Meier–estimated HGRF survival at 57 months was 13% (95% CI 6.9-21.5) and 33% (95% CI 19.5-46.6) in the CIS and Ta/T1 cohorts, respectively. Cystectomy-free survival at month 60 was 49% (95% CI 40.0-57.1): 43% (95% CI 32.2-53.7) in the CIS cohort and 59% (95% CI 43.1-71.4) in the Ta/T1 cohort. Overall survival at 60 months was 80% (71.0, 86.0): 76% (64.6-84.5) and 86% (70.9-93.5) in the CIS and Ta/T1 cohorts, respectively. Only 5 patients (4 with CIS and 1 with Ta/T1) experienced clinical progression to muscle-invasive disease.Conclusions:At 60 months, nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg allowed bladder preservation in nearly half of the patients and proved to be a safe option for BCG-unresponsive nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.","The “FLASH effect” is an increased therapeutic index, that is, reduced normal tissue toxicity for a given degree of anti-cancer efficacy, produced by ultra-rapid irradiation delivered on time scales orders of magnitude shorter than currently conventional in the clinic for the same doses. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous preclinical in vivo tumor and normal tissue models. While the underlying biological mechanism(s) remain to be elucidated, a path to clinical implementation of FLASH can be paved by addressing several critical translational questions. Technological questions pertinent to each beam type (for example, electron, proton, photon) also dictate the logical progression of experimentation required to move forward in safe and decisive clinical trials. Here we review the available preclinical data pertaining to these questions and how they may inform strategies for FLASH cancer therapy clinical trials.",0
"Background.There is evidence suggesting that COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with small, transitory effects on uterine bleeding, possibly including menstrual timing, flow, and duration, in some individuals. However, changes in health care seeking, diagnosis, and workup for abnormal uterine bleeding in the COVID-19 vaccine era are less clear.Objectives.To assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation in a large integrated health system.Study Design.Using segmented regression, we assessed whether the availability of COVID-19 vaccines was associated with changes in monthly, population-based rates of incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses compared to the pre-pandemic period in health system members ages 16–44 years who were not menopausal. We also compared clinical and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with incident abnormal uterine bleeding between December 2020 through October 13, 2021 by vaccination status (never vaccinated, vaccinated in the 60 days prior to diagnosis, vaccinated more than 60 days prior to diagnosis) and conducted detailed chart review of patients diagnosed with abnormal uterine bleeding within 1–60 days of COVID-19 vaccination in the same time period.Results.In monthly populations ranging from 79,000 to 85,000 female health system members, incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis per 100,000 person-days ranged from 8.97 to 19.19. There was no significant change in the level or trend in the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses between the pre-pandemic (January 2019-January 2020) and post-COVID-19 vaccine (December 2020-December 2021) periods. A comparison of clinical characteristics of 2,717 abnormal uterine bleeding cases by vaccination status suggested that abnormal bleeding among recently vaccinated patients was similar or less severe than abnormal bleeding among patients who had never been vaccinated patients or those vaccinated more than 60 days prior. There were also significant differences in age and race of patients with incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses by vaccination status: never vaccinated patients were the youngest and those vaccinated more than 60 days prior were the oldest; the proportion of patients who were Black/African American was highest among never vaccinated patients, and the proportion of Asian patients was higher among vaccinated patients. Chart review of 114 confirmed post-vaccination abnormal uterine bleeding cases diagnosed from December 2020 through October 13, 2021 found that the most common symptoms reported were changes in timing, duration, and volume of bleeding. Approximately one-third of cases received no diagnostic workup; 57% had no etiology for the bleeding documented in the electronic health record. In 12% of cases, the patient mentioned or asked about a possible link between their bleeding and their recent COVID-19 vaccine.Conclusions.The availability of COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with a change in incidence of medically attended abnormal uterine bleeding in our population of over 79,000 female patients of reproductive age. Additionally, among 2,717 patients with abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses in the period following COVID-19 vaccine availability, receipt of the vaccine was not associated with greater bleeding severity.","PurposeThe effect of immuno-chemotherapy on patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring oncogenic mutations remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the efficacy of immuno-chemotherapy and determine the optimal treatment strategy for such patients.MethodsWe conducted this retrospective cohort study on patients with NSCLC harboring oncogenic driver alterations and treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy at five institutions. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of immuno-chemotherapy for NSCLC with oncogenic mutations in a real-world setting were analyzed.ResultsAmong 846 patients diagnosed with advanced or recurrent NSCLC between April 2017 and April 2021, 43 patients with oncogenic mutations were treated with immuno-chemotherapy. The median age of patients was 68 (range 44–78) years; 42% of patients never smoked, and adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (95%). In patients with KRAS mutations (n = 10) or PD-L1 expression of 50% or greater (n = 10), the disease control rate was 100%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.4, 6.3, and 8.9 months in patients harboring mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and other genes, respectively (P = 0.22). Patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or greater had significantly longer median PFS than patients with PD-L1 expression of less than 50% (16.4 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.001). Two patients experienced grade 3 immuno-related adverse events.ConclusionImmuno-chemotherapy has a clinical benefit and is safe for patients with oncogenic mutations. Notably, patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or more experience greater benefit from immuno-chemotherapy than those with PD-L1 expression of less than 50%.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04125-8.",0
"The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to oncological care has transformed the management of various malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), offering improved outcomes. The first-line treatment of recurrent and malignant HNSCC for many years was combined platinum, 5-fluorouracil, and cetuximab. Recently, the ICI pembrolizumab was approved as a first-line treatment, with or without chemotherapy, based on tumor and immune cell percentage of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Multiple head and neck (HN) cancer trials have subsequently explored immunotherapies in combination with surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation. Immunotherapy regimens may be personalized by tumor biomarker, including PD-L1 content, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability. However, further clinical trials are needed to refine biomarker-driven protocols and standardize pathological methods to guide combined regimen timing, sequencing, and deescalation. Gaps remain for protocols using immunotherapy to reverse oral premalignant lesions, particularly high-risk leukoplakias. A phase II nonrandomized controlled trial, using the ICI nivolumab, showed a 2-y cancer-free survival of 73%, although larger trials are needed. Guidelines are also needed to standardize the role of dental evaluation and care before, during, and after immunotherapy, specifically in regard to oral immune-related adverse events and their impact on cancer recurrence. Standardized diagnostic and oral care coordination strategies to close these gaps are needed to ensure continued success of HN cancer immunotherapy.","ABSTRACTExtracellular Vesicles (EVs) became a focus of clinical research when experimental and pre-clinical studies showed that they mimic their parent cells’ regenerative and therapeutic effects and their cargo carries disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Since the publication of data forms an endpoint of the study, this review specifically focused on the published clinical trials done with EVs. For brevity, this review was restricted to the last 10 years. Unexpectedly, the literature search showed that very few clinical trials assessing the therapeutic applications of EVs were published in this period indicating that they have not reached their desired endpoint. Conversely, most studies showed the potential of EVs present in various biofluids as a promising source of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for various diseases, and predictive markers to assess the effectiveness of therapy. This stark difference in the numbers could perhaps be due to the time-consuming regulatory processes involved in the clinical-grade preparation and characterization of EVs, and the determination of their safety and effective dose regimens. One wonders whether fast-tracking regulatory affairs could help accelerate the therapeutic use of EVs. This aspect needs urgent attention.",1
"More and more studies have revealed that P2 purinergic receptors play a key role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors can be used as promoters and regulators of CRC and play a dual role in the progression of CRC. CRC microenvironment is rich in ATP and its cleavage products (ADP, AMP, Ado), which act as activators of P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors. The activation of P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors regulates the progression of CRC mainly by regulating the function of immune cells and mediating different signal pathways. In this paper, we focus on the specific mechanisms and functional roles of P2X7, P2Y12, and P2Y2 receptors in the growth and progression of CRC. The antagonistic effects of these selective antagonists of P2X purinergic receptors on the growth, invasion, and metastasis of CRC were further discussed. Moreover, different studies have reported that P2X7 receptor can be used as an effective predictor of patients with CRC. All these indicate that P2 purinergic receptors are a key regulator of CRC. Therefore, antagonizing P2 purinergic receptors may be an innovative treatment for CRC.","Studies have confirmed that P2 purinergic receptors (P2X receptors and P2Y receptors) expressed in gastric cancer (GC) cells and GC tissues and correlates with their function. Endogenous nucleotides including ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP, as P2 purinergic receptors activators, participate in P2 purinergic signal transduction pathway. These activated P2 purinergic receptors regulate the progression of GC mainly by mediating ion channels and intracellular signal cascades. It is worth noting that there is a difference in the expression of P2 purinergic receptors in GC, which may play different roles in the progression of GC as a tumor promoting factor or a tumor suppressor factor. Among them, P2 × 7, P2Y2 and P2Y6 receptors have certain clinical significance in patients with GC and may be used as biological molecular markers for the prediction of patients with GC. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss the functional role of nucleotide / P2 purinergic receptors signal axis in regulating the progression of GC and that these P2 purinergic receptors may be used as potential molecular targets for the prevention and treatment of GC.",1
"Antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapy has become one of the most promising approaches in cancer immunotherapy. Bispecific targeting could enhance the efficacy and safety of ADC by improving its specificity, affinity and internalization. In this study we constructed a HER2/HER3-targeting bispecific ADC (BsADC) and characterized its physiochemical properties, target specificity and internalization in vitro, and assessed its anti-tumor activities in breast cancer cell lines and in animal models. The HER2/HER3-targeting BsADC had a drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of 2.89, displayed a high selectivity against the target JIMT-1 breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as a slightly higher level of internalization than HER2- or HER3-monospecific ADCs. More importantly, the bispecific ADC potently inhibited the viability of MCF7, JIMT-1, BT474, BxPC-3 and SKOV-3 cancer cells in vitro. In JIMT-1 breast cancer xenograft mice, a single injection of bispecific ADC (3 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly inhibited the tumor growth with an efficacy comparable to that caused by combined injection of HER2 and HER3-monospecific ADCs (3 mg/kg for each). Our study demonstrates that the bispecific ADC concept can be applied to development of more potent new cancer therapeutics than the monospecific ADCs.","The advancements in the detection and characterization of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have revolutionized precision medicine and are likely to transform standard clinical practice. The non‐invasive nature of this approach allows for molecular profiling of the entire tumor entity, while also enabling real‐time monitoring of the effectiveness of cancer therapies as well as the identification of resistance mechanisms to guide targeted therapy. Although the field of ctDNA studies offers a wide range of applications, including in early disease, in this review we mainly focus on the role of ctDNA in the dynamic molecular characterization of unresectable locally advanced and metastatic BC (mBC). Here, we provide clinical practice guidance for the rapidly evolving field of molecular profiling of mBC, outlining the current landscape of liquid biopsy applications and how to choose the right ctDNA assay. Additionally, we underline the importance of exploring the clinical relevance of novel molecular alterations that potentially represent therapeutic targets in mBC, along with mutations where targeted therapy is already approved. Finally, we present a potential roadmap for integrating ctDNA analysis into clinical practice.",1
"Exosomes continue to attract interest as a promising nanocarrier drug delivery technology. They are naturally derived nanoscale extracellular vesicles with innate properties well suited to shuttle proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. Nonetheless, their clinical utility is currently limited by several major challenges, such as their inability to target tumor cells and a high proportion of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) of the liver and spleen. To overcome these limitations, we developed “Smart Exosomes” that co-display RGD and CD47p110–130 through CD9 engineering (ExoSmart). The resultant ExoSmart demonstrates enhanced binding capacity to αvβ3 on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, resulting in amplified cellular uptake in in vitro and in vivo models and increased chemotherapeutic efficacies. Simultaneously, ExoSmart significantly reduced liver and spleen clearance of exosomes by inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis via CD47p110–130 interaction with signal regulatory proteins (SIRPα) on macrophages. These studies demonstrate that an engineered exosome drug delivery system increases PDAC therapeutic efficacy by enhancing active PDAC targeting and prolonging circulation times, and their findings hold tremendous translational potential for cancer therapy while providing a concrete foundation for future work utilizing novel peptide-engineered exosome strategies.","PurposeExosomes are membrane-derived nano-vesicles upregulated in pathological conditions like cancer. Therefore, inhibiting their release is a potential strategy for the development of more efficient combination therapies. Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) is a key component in exosome release; however, a clinically safe yet efficient nSMase2 inhibitor remains to be used discovered. Accordingly, we made an effort to identify potential nSMase2 inhibitor(s) among the approved drugs.MethodsVirtual screening was performed and aprepitant was selected for further investigation. To evaluate the reliability of the complex, molecular dynamics were performed. Finally, using the CCK-8 assay in HCT116 cells, the highest non-toxic concentrations of aprepitant were identified and the nSMase2 activity assay was performed to measure the inhibitory activity of aprepitant, in vitro.ResultsTo validate the screening results, molecular docking was performed, and the retrieved scores were in line with the screening results. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) plot of aprepitant–nSMase2 showed proper convergence. Following treatment with different concentrations of aprepitant in both cell-free and cell-dependent assays, nSMase2 activity was remarkably decreased.ConclusionAprepitant, at a concentration as low as 15 µM, was able to inhibit nSmase2 activity in HCT116 cells without any significant effects on their viability. Aprepitant is therefore suggested to be a potentially safe exosome release inhibitor.",1
"Purpose This study examined the roles of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in colon carcinogenesis, underscoring on sex and differences in tumor location.Materials and Methods A total of 378 participants were enrolled from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital: 88 healthy controls (HC), 139 patients with colorectal adenoma (AD), and 151 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), methylation-specific PCR, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed utilizing tumor samples from patients and normal mucosa in the HC group.Results NRF2 mRNA expression was higher in the CRC group than in the HC and AD groups, with decreased NRF2 methylation in the AD and CRC groups. NRF2 protein expression, as evaluated by IHC, increased in the AD and CRC groups relative to that in the HC group. PD-L1 protein expression was remarkably higher in the CRC group than in the HC and AD groups. These patterns were consistent in both males and females. In sex- and CRC location-specific analyses, NRF2 methylation was lower in female than in male patients with CRC. NRF2 protein expression was significantly higher in females, particularly in patients with right-sided CRC. Moreover, females exhibited increased PD-L1 mRNA expression compared to males in the AD group, and PD-L1 mRNA levels were higher in females with right-sided CRC than in those with cancer at other locations.Conclusion Differences in NRF2 and PD-L1 expression indicate site-specific colon carcinogenesis based on sex, particularly in females with right-sided CRC.","IntroductionUnderstanding of molecular model of oral carcinogenesis has carried cancer chemotherapy far forward from conventional drug therapies. Small molecule inhibitors have gained acceptance as it has fewer adverse effects and also provide targeted drug therapy. The association of HSP 70 (Heat Shock Protein 70) and BCL 2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) proteins with oral precancer and cancer is already established. However, the complex interaction between these two proteins and how they affect each other’s expression is still not understood completely. In our study, we aimed to correlate the expression of HSP 70 and BCL 2 with different histopathological grades of oral precancer and cancer tissue samples using tissue immunohistochemistry.Materials and MethodsTissue samples were taken from a total of 250 patients (100 OPMDs and 150 OSCCs) and subjected to immunohistochemistry using anti-human mouse monoclonal antibodies to HSP70 and BCL2. Immunostaining was done, and the immunostaining intensity distribution (IID) index was calculated.Results and DiscussionImmunoreactivity scores for both HSP 70 and BCL 2 correlated with different grades of dysplasia. However, only HSP 70 had a statistically significant association (p = 0.066). We also found that HSP 70 showed an inverse correlation, with higher expression majorly seen in well-differentiated OSCCs.ConclusionOur study unveiled the HSP 70–BCL 2 interaction and provides insights about how this might affect drug designing and help overcome therapeutic lags. However, further studies are needed to provide a comprehensive review of such interactions among various small molecules.",1
"Pleural mesothelioma (PM), a rare malignant tumor explicitly associated with asbestos and erionite exposures, has become a global health problem due to limited treatment options and a poor prognosis, in which the median life expectancy varies depending on the method of treatment. However, the importance of early diagnosis is emphasized, and the practical methods have not matured yet. This study provides a critical overview of PM, addressing various aspects like epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment options, and the potential use of advanced technologies like microfluidic chip-based models for research and diagnosis. It initially begins with fundamentals of clinical aspects and then discusses the identification of disease-specific biomarkers in patients’ serum or plasma samples, which could potentially be used for early diagnosis. A detailed investigation of the sophisticated preclinical models is highlighted. Recent three-dimensional (3D) model accomplishments, including microarchitecture modeling by transwell coculture, spheroids, organoids, 3D bioprinting constructs, and ex vivo tumor slices, are discussed comprehensively. On-chip models that imitate physiological processes, such as detection chips and therapeutic screening chips, are assessed as potential techniques. The review concludes with a critical and constructive discussion of the growing interest in the topic and its limitations and suggestions.","BackgroundAn increasing number of studies have focused on the early diagnostic value of the methylation of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer. However, the intricate cellular events related to RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer are still a mystery. For researchers and clinicians aiming to more profoundly understand the diagnostic value of methylated RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, this review will provide deeper insights into the molecular events of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer.MethodologyWe searched for relevant publications in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using the keywords “RASSF1A”, “SHOX2” and “lung cancer” etc. First, we reviewed the RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes, from their family structures to the functions of their basic structural domains. Then we mainly focused on the roles of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, especially on their molecular events in recent decades. Finally, we compared the value of measuring RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation with that of the common methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer patients.ResultsThe RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes were confirmed to be regulators or effectors of multiple cancer signaling pathways, driving tumorigenesis and lung cancer progression. The detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation has higher sensitivity and specificity than other commonly used methods for diagnosing lung cancer, especially in the early stage.ConclusionsThe RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes are critical for the processes of tumorigenesis, development, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence in lung cancer. The combined detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation was identified as an excellent method for the screening and surveillance of lung cancer that exhibits high sensitivity and specificity.",0
"The fixation and permeabilization of cells are essential for labeling intracellular biomarkers in flow cytometry. However, these chemical treatments often alter fragile targets, such as cell surface and fluorescent proteins (FPs), and can destroy chemically-sensitive fluorescent labels. This reduces measurement accuracy and introduces compromises into sample workflows, leading to losses in data quality. Here, we demonstrate a novel multi-pass flow cytometry approach to address this long-standing problem. Our technique utilizes individual cell barcoding with laser particles, enabling sequential analysis of the same cells with single-cell resolution maintained. Chemically-fragile protein markers and their fluorochrome conjugates are measured prior to destructive sample processing and adjoined to subsequent measurements of intracellular markers after fixation and permeabilization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in accurately measuring intracellular FPs and methanol-sensitive antigens and fluorophores, along with various surface and intracellular markers. This approach significantly enhances assay flexibility, enabling accurate and comprehensive cellular analysis without the constraints of conventional one-time measurement flow cytometry. This innovation paves new avenues in flow cytometry for a wide range of applications in immuno-oncology, stem cell research, and cell biology.",ABSTRACTLatest developments in the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine compiled from publicly available information and press releases from non-academic institutions in September 2024.,0
"Pyroptosis-related genes have great potential for prognosis, an accurate prognostic model based on pyroptosis genes has not been seen in Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD). Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms of gene expression characteristics and the Tumor Immune Microenvironment associated with the prognosis of COAD is still largely unknown. Constructing a prognostic model based on pyroptosis-related genes, and revealing prognosis-related mechanisms associated with the gene expression characteristics and tumor microenvironment. 59 pyroptosis-related genes were collected. The gene expression data and clinical data of COAD were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. External validation datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. 10 characteristic genes with prognostic values were obtained using univariate and LASSO Cox. 10-gene Riskscore prognostic model was constructed. Both gene set enrichment analysis and network propagation methods were used to find pathways and key genes leading to different prognostic risks. The area under the ROC curves were used to evaluate the performance of the model to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients, the results were 0.718, 0.672, and 0.669 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival times. A nomogram based on Riskscore and clinical characteristics showed the probability of survival at 1, 3, and 5 years, and the calibration curves showed good agreement between the predicted and actual observations, its C-index is 0.793. The decision curves showed that the net benefit of the nomogram was significantly superior to that of the other single variables. Four key pathways leading to different prognostic risks were obtained. Six key genes with prognostic value, significant expression differences (P < .05) and significant survival differences (P < .05) between high/low risk groups were obtained from the gene set of all 4 key pathways. This study constructed a prognostic model for COAD using 10 pyroptosis-related genes with prognostic value. This study also revealed significant differences in specific pathways and the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) between the high-risk group and the low-risk group, highlighted the roles of ALDH5A1 and Wnt signaling in promoting COAD and the suppressive effects of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway and RORC on COAD. The study will be helpful for precision therapy.","BackgroundCuproptosis was defined as a novel nonapoptotic cell death pathway and its potential function in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear.MethodsWe obtained gene expression profiles, somatic mutation and corresponding clinical information of 881 ccRCC samples from 3 cohorts including the cancer genome atlas cohort, GSE29609 cohort and CheckMate 025 cohort. As described in the latest published article, we enrolled 16 genes as cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs). We explored the expression level, variants and copy number variation of the CRGs. Univariate and multi-variate regression were utilized to assess the prognostic significance of the CRGs. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to identify potential subgroup and gene set variation analysis was used to explore the potential biological functions. CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE algorithm and single sample gene set enrichment analysis were used to evaluate the tumor microenvironment. In vitro experiments including CCK-8, transwell and wound healing assays were utilized to explore the potential biological function of DLAT in ccRCC.ResultsWe found that except for CDKN2A, the CRGs were positively associated with patients’ OS. Cuproptosis cluster, cuproptosis gene cluster and cuproptosis score were established, respectively, and higher cuproptosis score was significantly associated with a worse OS in ccRCC (p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the cuproptosis-related nomogram at 1 year, 3 years, 5 years was 0.858, 0.821 and 0.78, respectively. In addition, we found that the cuproptosis score was positively associated with PDCD1, CTLA4 expression level, thus the cuproptosis score may also reflect the dysfunction of tumor infiltrating immune cells. In vitro experiments indicated that overexpression of DLAT could inhibited the migration and proliferation ability of ccRCC cells.ConclusionOur findings identify a novel cuproptosis-related signature and the cuproptosis characteristics may influence the anti-tumor immunity though complex regulating networks, and thus cuproptosis may play a role in developing novel therapeutic target of ccRCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05259-z.",0
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy that is often resistant to standard therapy. An immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and oncogenic mutations in KRAS have both been implicated as drivers of resistance to therapy. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) inhibition has not yet shown clinical efficacy, likely due to rapid acquisition of tumor intrinsic resistance. However, the unique PDAC TME also be a key driver in resistance. Herein, we found that long-term FAK inhibitor treatment leads to hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway in PDAC cells in both mouse models and tissues from treated human PDAC patients. Concomitant inhibition of both FAK (with VS-4718) and RAF-MEK (with avutometinib) induced tumor growth inhibition and increased survival across multiple PDAC mouse models. In the TME, we found that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) impaired the downregulation of cMyc by RAF-MEK inhibition in PDAC cells, resulting in resistance. By contrast, FAK inhibition reprogramed CAFs to suppress the production of FGF1, which can drive resistance to RAF-MEK inhibition. The addition of chemotherapy to combined FAK and RAF-MEK inhibition led to tumor regression, decrease in liver metastasis and improved long-term survival in KRAS-driven PDAC mouse models. Combination of FAK and RAF-MEK inhibition alone improved anti-tumor immunity and priming of T-cell responses in response to chemotherapy. These findings provided the rationale for the ongoing clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of avutometinib and defactinib in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in PDAC patients (RAMP 205; NCT05669482) and may suggest further paths for combined stromal and tumor targeting therapies.","Graphical abstractThis review elucidates the molecular compatibility theory for desired effects by organically combining multiple active molecules derived from TCM, which provides some new insights on the development of modern TCM.",0
"To evaluate the time of onset of dysphagia in a cohort of head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation or chemoradiation. Retrospective chart review of adult patients. 237 patients met inclusion criteria for the study. The average age at cancer diagnosis was 62 years (± 12.6) in a predominantly male cohort (n = 198, 83.5%). The most common subsite was oropharyngeal (n = 146, 60.8%) and squamous cell carcinoma in origin (n = 232, 97.9%). Of head and neck cancer patients diagnosed with new onset dysphagia or a dysphagia related diagnosis, nine (3.8%) were diagnosed at six months to 1 year, 12 (5.1%) at 1–2 years, and 17 (7.1%) at greater than 2 years. The mean radiation dose to the larynx was 43.8 Gy (Gy) (± 14.5) and statistically significant across time the periods (p = 0.018, η2 = 0.161). No difference was found between age, HPV status, T stage, smoking history, or tumor site. The majority of head and neck cancer patients treated with chemoradiation who developed dysphagia did so within the acute time period (during treatment and up to 6 months post treatment). However, a substantial proportion of patients also developed dysphagia in later time periods (16%). The incidence of dysphagia in certain time periods may be impacted by laryngeal radiation dose. Therefore, we recommend long term monitoring/screening of these patients so early intervention can occur.","AbstractIntroductionImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are fundamental in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Considering previous reports implied varied responses among patient subgroups, such as patients with different hepatitis etiologies, we planned this meta-analysis to identify specific populations that might derive greater survival benefits from ICIs as a first-line treatment.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed and the Cochrane Library for phase III clinical trials comparing ICIs and multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) as first-line therapies for advanced HCC. We extracted and synthesized hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival across different patient subgroups mainly using the random-effect model.ResultsOur analysis included nine phase III trials involving ICIs, either alone or in combination with other treatments, compared with MKIs. The synthesized HRs for patients with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and nonviral etiologies were 0.74, 0.77, and 0.86, respectively, showing no significant differences (p = 0.13). Such finding remained when we only analyzed clinical trials with positive results. HRs consistently favored ICIs across various demographics such as age, sex, geographic region, performance status, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and disease stage or extent. Notably, patients with extrahepatic spread showed a trend toward better outcomes (HR 0.73) compared to those without (HR 0.85, p = 0.07).ConclusionThe efficacy of ICIs as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC was consistent across diverse patient subgroups, regardless of hepatitis etiology or other demographic factors. These findings do not support using these characteristics to determine the use of ICI therapy in advanced HCC.",0
"BackgroundChemokines play a vital role in tumor progression, metastasis and prognosis; however, the profile and clinical significance of gamma interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and its receptor (CXCR3) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well evaluated.MethodsLiquid-phase chip technology was used to detect the serum IP-10 in 85 patients with HBV-related HCC, 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 50 liver cirrhosis subjects (CS); simultaneously, the CXCR3 and Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) were determined. Additionally, their mRNA or protein expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), liver tumor and paracancerous tissues were quantified using qRT-PCR or ELISA. Moreover, the IP-10 and CXCR3 expression was verified by the online data from Gene Expression Omnibus. Furthermore, the relationships of serum IP-10, CXCR3 and AFP levels with their overall survival rate were also analyzed.ResultsThe levels of IP-10 and CXCR3 in HCC group were significantly higher than those in CHB and CS groups, and their mRNA of PBMC is significantly positive correlation with those in their liver tissues or HBV DNA load (P < 0.0001), respectively. The serum IP-10 and CXCR3 in HCC were significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, metastases staging and distant metastasis (P < 0.05), but not related to gender, age and tumor size (P > 0.05, except IP-10 based on age).ConclusionsThe serum IP-10 (142.6 pg/mL) and CXCR3 (241.2 pg/mL) could be differential diagnostic surrogates that distinguish HCC from CS, and the lower IP-10 level may be conducive to the postoperative survival of HCC patients. Moreover, the IP-10 and CXCR3 would be related to anti-tumor immunity in HCC patients and be a potential target for treatment of HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05265-1.","AbstractBackgroundThis study validates MRI-based tumor habitats in predicting time-to-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and progression sites in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma patients.MethodsSeventy-nine patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2020 and June 2022. MRI, including diffusion-weighted and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, were obtained immediately postoperation and at three serial timepoints. Voxels from cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were grouped into three habitats (hypervascular cellular, hypovascular cellular, and nonviable tissue) using k-means clustering. Predefined cutoffs for increases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitat were applied to calculate the habitat risk score. Associations between spatiotemporal habitats, habitat risk score, TTP, and OS were investigated using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Habitat risk score was compared to tumor volume using time-dependent receiver operating characteristics analysis. Progression sites were matched with spatial habitats.ResultsIncreases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitats and habitat risk scores were associated with shorter TTP and OS (all P < .05). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk scores 1 and 2 independently predicted TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 4.14; P = .03, HR, 4.51; P = .001 and HR, 10.02; P < .001, respectively). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk score 2 independently predicted OS (HR, 4.01, P = .003; and HR, 3.27, P < .001, respectively). Habitat risk score outperformed tumor volume in predicting TTP (12-month AUC, 0.762 vs. 0.646, P = .048). Hypovascular cellular habitat predicted progression sites (mean Dice index: 0.31).ConclusionsMultiparametric physiologic MRI-based spatiotemporal tumor habitats and habitat risk scores are useful biomarkers for early tumor progression and outcomes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients.",0
"AbstractGlioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain cancer, where dismal outcomes result from disease recurrence driven by tumour-initiating glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs survive and expand in the brain after surgery, radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) amidst weak immune and natural killer (NK) cell surveillance. Efficient NK cell-mediated killing of GBM cells occurs at high effector to target ratios precluding effective eradication of large tumour remnants, as enforced by clinical trials with autologous NK cells in an adjuvant setting. Here we explore in a human GSC xenograft model whether tumor depopulation using high dose Temozolomide (TMZ) could create a window of curative opportunity for endogenous or exogenous NK cells. We observed that while subcutaneous (sc) xenografts of patient derived GSCs are infiltrated by endogenous functional (NCR1+) NK cells in SCID mice, the corresponding intracranial (ic) tumours remained NK cell depleted. Notably, while TMZ caused near complete regression of intracranial GSC xenografts this was followed by inevitable recurrence of drug-resistant lesions. To explore whether direct delivery of NK cells into depopulated intracranial tumours would change the lethal course of the disease, mice were injected with GSCs intracranially, and upon tumour formation were treated with a sequence of TMZ (systemically), at 2, 7, 14, and 21 days later with irradiated NK92MI cells. Remarkably, this combined therapy completely obliterated recurrent disease at 2 and 7 days but not beyond 14 days. To assess whether NK92MI cells could be replaced by their derived extracellular vesicles (NK-EVs), the latter were injected i.c. post TMZ in GSC xenograft bearing mice. A single injection of NK-EVs resulted in tumour eradication in some but not all mice. Thus, chemotherapy-dependent tumour depopulation may create a unique window of opportunity for curative NK-mediated immunotherapy in GBM.","IntroductionCharacterized by vast heterogeneity, gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. A specific prognostic model is necessary for the improvement of clinical treatment strategies. Hypoxia is a common feature in the tumor microenvironment that promotes tumor progression. However, the current evaluation of the hypoxic tumor immune microenvironment in GC is still inadequate.Material and methodsWith sequence data and single nucleotide variants data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas-STAD dataset as well as hypoxia- and immune-related genes acquired from MsigDB and ImmPort, a hypoxia-immune-based gene signature of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) was built by Cox regression analysis. The risk score could be used as an independent prognostic factor.ResultsThe receiver operating characteristic curve and survival curve showed the accuracy of the model. Pearson correlation analysis showed that DUSP1, one of the hypoxia- and immune-related feature genes, was positively correlated with immune cell scores and immune-related function scores. In addition, low-risk group peers were found to be in higher immune infiltration status and had a higher immunophenoscore as demonstrated by single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), indicating a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment among the low-risk group. q-PCR results showed that DUSP1, IGFBP1, CGB5, GPC3 and EGF were significantly highly expressed in STAD cells, while FAM3D and FGF8 were significantly down-regulated.ConclusionsOverall, our study not only paves the way for future studies focusing on hypoxia and the immune microenvironment but also improves STAD patients’ prognosis and their response to immunotherapy.",0
"PurposeThe incidence and mortality of lung cancer are continuously rising in recent years. Mitochondrial energy metabolism malfunction is found to be crucial in cancer proliferation and bioenergetic reprogramming, especially for lung cancer. In this study, we attempted to use mitochondrial-targeted drug therapy to change the energy metabolism pattern of cancer cells to inhibit the development of lung cancer, and investigated its mechanism of action and key targets through multi-omics studies.MethodsIn this study, we established the in vivo tumor mouse mode, treated mice with multiple mitochondrial-targeted drug combinations and DDP, severally. Then, we investigated the differences between the 7-drug group with the control group and the DDP treatment group by transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to find the therapeutic targets.ResultsWe found that mitochondria-targeting drug cocktail therapy, especially the 7-drug regimen, effectively improved mitochondrial metabolism, changed energy supply patterns in lung cancer cells, significantly increased NK cells in tumor tissues, and decreased tumor markers in plasma. Multi-omics analysis informed that the combination of 7-drug could up-regulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthesis and autophagy related genes, and down-regulate proliferation and immune-related genes compared with the control group. By further mapping the protein interaction network, we identified a key target for 7-drug therapy to reverse tumor metabolic reprogramming and validated it in metabolomics.ConclusionsMitochondrial-targeted drug cocktail therapy can effectively inhibit the occurrence and development of tumors, through the reprogramming of energy metabolism and the increase in immune cells in tumor tissues. Thus, we provide a novel approach for the treatment of lung cancer and present evidence-based clues for the combined use of targeted mitochondrial drugs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05376-9.","Background.There is evidence suggesting that COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with small, transitory effects on uterine bleeding, possibly including menstrual timing, flow, and duration, in some individuals. However, changes in health care seeking, diagnosis, and workup for abnormal uterine bleeding in the COVID-19 vaccine era are less clear.Objectives.To assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation in a large integrated health system.Study Design.Using segmented regression, we assessed whether the availability of COVID-19 vaccines was associated with changes in monthly, population-based rates of incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses compared to the pre-pandemic period in health system members ages 16–44 years who were not menopausal. We also compared clinical and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with incident abnormal uterine bleeding between December 2020 through October 13, 2021 by vaccination status (never vaccinated, vaccinated in the 60 days prior to diagnosis, vaccinated more than 60 days prior to diagnosis) and conducted detailed chart review of patients diagnosed with abnormal uterine bleeding within 1–60 days of COVID-19 vaccination in the same time period.Results.In monthly populations ranging from 79,000 to 85,000 female health system members, incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis per 100,000 person-days ranged from 8.97 to 19.19. There was no significant change in the level or trend in the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses between the pre-pandemic (January 2019-January 2020) and post-COVID-19 vaccine (December 2020-December 2021) periods. A comparison of clinical characteristics of 2,717 abnormal uterine bleeding cases by vaccination status suggested that abnormal bleeding among recently vaccinated patients was similar or less severe than abnormal bleeding among patients who had never been vaccinated patients or those vaccinated more than 60 days prior. There were also significant differences in age and race of patients with incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses by vaccination status: never vaccinated patients were the youngest and those vaccinated more than 60 days prior were the oldest; the proportion of patients who were Black/African American was highest among never vaccinated patients, and the proportion of Asian patients was higher among vaccinated patients. Chart review of 114 confirmed post-vaccination abnormal uterine bleeding cases diagnosed from December 2020 through October 13, 2021 found that the most common symptoms reported were changes in timing, duration, and volume of bleeding. Approximately one-third of cases received no diagnostic workup; 57% had no etiology for the bleeding documented in the electronic health record. In 12% of cases, the patient mentioned or asked about a possible link between their bleeding and their recent COVID-19 vaccine.Conclusions.The availability of COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with a change in incidence of medically attended abnormal uterine bleeding in our population of over 79,000 female patients of reproductive age. Additionally, among 2,717 patients with abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses in the period following COVID-19 vaccine availability, receipt of the vaccine was not associated with greater bleeding severity.",0
"BackgroundLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens people’s health worldwide. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in regulating LUAD growth and metastasis as well as in therapeutic response. However, currently, there is a lack of integrative analysis of PCD-related signatures of LUAD for accurate prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response.MethodsThe bulk transcriptome and clinical information of LUAD were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. A total of 1382 genes involved in regulating 13 various PCD patterns (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, netotic cell death, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, parthanatos, autophagy-dependent cell death, oxeiptosis, alkaliptosis and disulfidptosis) were included in the study. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were performed to identify PCD-associated differential expression genes (DEGs). An unsupervised consensus clustering algorithm was used to explore the potential subtypes of LUAD based on the expression profiles of PCD-associated DEGs. Univariate Cox regression analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, Random Forest (RF) analysis and stepwise multivariate Cox analysis were performed to construct a prognostic gene signature. The “oncoPredict” algorithm was utilized for drug-sensitive analysis. GSVA and GSEA were utilized to perform function enrichment analysis. MCPcounter, quanTIseq, Xcell and ssGSEA algorithms were used for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. A nomogram incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics was established to predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.ResultsForty PCD-associated DEGs related to LUAD were obtained by WGCNA analysis and differential expression analysis, followed by unsupervised clustering to identify two LUAD molecular subtypes. A programmed cell death index (PCDI) with a five-gene signature was established by machine learning algorithms. LUAD patients were then divided into a high PCDI group and a low PCDI group using the median PCDI as a cutoff. Survival and therapeutic analysis revealed that the high PCDI group had a poor prognosis and was more sensitive to targeted drugs but less sensitive to immunotherapy compared to the low PCDI group. Further enrichment analysis showed that B cell-related pathways were significantly downregulated in the high PCDI group. Accordingly, the decreased tumor immune cell infiltration and the lower tumor tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) scores were also found in the high PCDI group. Finally, a nomogram with reliable predictive performance PCDI was constructed by incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics, and a user-friendly online website was established for clinical reference ( performed the first comprehensive analysis of the clinical relevance of genes regulating 13 PCD patterns in LUAD and identified two LUAD molecular subtypes with distinct PCD-related gene signature which indicated differential prognosis and treatment sensitivity. Our study provided a new index to predict the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and the prognosis of LUAD patients for guiding personalized treatments.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05000-w.","PurposeTo investigate oncological outcomes and patterns of recurrence of patients undergoing adjuvant “sandwich” chemo-radio-chemotherapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer.MethodsThis is a multi-institutional retrospective study evaluating chart of consecutive patients undergoing chemo-radio-chemotherapy for FIGO stage III–IVA endometrial caner.ResultsThe study population included 45 patients who had adjuvant sandwich regimen. Median age of the study population was 66 years. The majority of patients were diagnosed with endometrioid histology and with stage III disease. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 15 patients developed recurrent disease. Three-year disease-free and overall survivals was 45% and 81%, respectively. Three-years site-specific disease-free survival was 85%, 92% and 48% for local, loco-regional, and distant recurrence, respectively. All patients included in the study had nodal dissection. Nodal assessment included: sentinel node mapping, sentinel node mapping plus backup lymphadenectomy and lymphadenectomy in 15, 6 and 24 patients, respectively. The latter group included four patients detected by suspected enlarged nodes, intraoperatively. Even after the exclusion of patients with enlarged nodes, the type of nodal assessment did not impact on survival outcomes (p > 0.2). Positive peritoneal cytology was the only factor associated with an increased risk of developing (any site) recurrence and distant-specific recurrence, independently. No factor predicted for overall survival.ConclusionAdjuvant “sandwich” chemo-radio-chemotherapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer guarantee promising local and loco-regional controls, but distant failure rate is high, thus suggesting the need for applying other systemic treatment strategies for these patients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03339-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"Immune checkpoints including PD-1 and CTLA-4 help to regulate the intensity and timeframe of the immune response. Since they become upregulated in cancer and prevent sufficient antitumor immunity, monoclonal antibodies against these checkpoints have shown clinical promise for a range of cancers. Multimodal treatment plans combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with other therapies, including photodynamic therapy (PDT), may help to expand treatment efficacy and minimize side effects. PDT’s cytotoxic effects are spatially limited by the light activation process, constraining PDT direct effects to the treatment field. The production of damage-associated molecular patterns and tumor-associated antigens from PDT can encourage accumulation and maturation of antigen-presenting cells and reprogram the tumor microenvironment to be more susceptible to therapies targeting immune checkpoints.","BackgroundIn Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Qi-deficiency and Phlegm-turbid stagnation (QP) are the most prevalent Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome.MethodsHerein, we collected 90 fecal samples (Healthy individual (H): 30; other syndrome (O): 30; QP: 30) and explored the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in LUAD patients with QP syndrome using 16s-rRNA sequencing. Then, we identified biomarkers for QP syndrome in LUAD patients with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) and applied logistic regression analysis to construct a diagnostic model evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and validated with data from metagenomics.ResultsThe α diversity and β diversity revealed that the microbiota community structure in LUAD patients with QP syndrome was different from that with healthy individuals and LUAD patients with other syndromes. At the phylum level, the QP group had more abundance of Bacteroidetes and less Proteobacteria than the O group. At the genus level, the abundance of 4 genera (Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, and Flavonifractor) was different between the QP group and O group. Moreover, LEfSe indicated that those 4 genera might be the biomarkers for LUAD patients with QP syndrome. Then, we used those 4 genera to develop a diagnostic model. The AUC based on 16s-rRNA sequencing and metagenomics was 0.989 and 1, respectively.ConclusionA diagnostic model was developed, which would be an available tool for the clinical diagnosis of LUAD with QP syndrome.",0
"BackgroundAdditional prognostic factors and personalized therapeutic alternatives for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC), especially for advanced stages with poor prognosis, are urgently needed.ObjectivesTo review and assess literature regarding underlying molecular mechanisms of VSCC target therapeutic and prognostic approaches.MethodsWe performed a narrative literature review from the inception of the database up to January 2020 limited to English language, organizing knowledge in five main fields: extracellular and intracellular cell cycle deregulation, tumor immune microenvironment, tumor angiogenesis and hormones.ResultsEGFR immunohistochemical overexpression/gene amplification, representing early events in VSCC carcinogenesis, have been correlated with a worse prognosis and led to inclusion of erlotinib in cancer guidelines. p16 expression and HPV positivity are linked to a better prognosis, while p53 overexpression is linked to a worse prognosis; thus, biomarkers could help tailoring conventional treatment and follow-up. The implications of PD-L1 positivity in reference to HPV status and prognosis are still not clear, even though pembrolizumab is part of available systemic therapies. The role of tumor angiogenesis emerges through data on microvessel density, immunohistochemical VEGF staining and evaluation of serum VEGF concentrations. Few data exist on hormonal receptor expression, even though hormonal therapy showed great manageability.ConclusionsWe suggest adding p16, p53 and HPV status to routine hystopathological examination of vulvar biopsies or surgical specimens. Predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs are needed. Enough preclinical data supporting anti-angiogenic target therapies in clinical trials are existing. Hormonal receptor expression deserves further investigation.","PurposePostmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with T1–2N1 breast cancer is still controversial. This study was to evaluate the survival prognosis of T1-2N1 patients with or without PMRT.Patients and methodsFrom January 2006 to May 2017, 2606 female breast cancer patients underwent mastectomy in our medical center, among whom 402 patients of T1-2N1 stage with or without PMRT were finally analyzed. The median follow-up duration was 59.5 months. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS).ResultsIn the study of our center, no statistically significant difference was observed between the T1-2N1 PMRT and non-PMRT subgroups for the 5-year OS (94.4% vs 95.4%, p = 0.667) and DFS (90.1% vs. 91.1%, p = 0.798). By the date of the last follow-up, 8.96% (n = 36) of the patients experienced any recurrence. Univariate analysis revealed that PMRT was not a prognostic factor for either OS (p = 0.667) or DFS (p = 0.798) in T1-2N1 patients. We then did a meta-analysis on the current treatment patterns, in which 2606 PMRT and 4281 non-PMRT T1-2N1 breast cancer patients with mastectomy were included. The meta-analysis showed that PMRT didn't improve the OS of the patients (HR = 0.85, p = 0.11), but patients with PMRT had better DFS than those in the non-PMRT group (HR = 0.62, p < 0.001).ConclusionPMRT did not affect the survival of T1-2N1 breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy, suggesting that radiotherapy may be safely omitted for them.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04908-7.",1
"Background & Aims:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a heterogeneous and lethal malignancy, the molecular origins of which remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRs) target diverse signalling pathways, functioning as potent epigenetic regulators of transcriptional output. We aimed to characterise miRNome dysregulation in CCA, including its impact on transcriptome homeostasis and cell behaviour.Methods:Small RNA sequencing was performed on 119 resected CCAs, 63 surrounding liver (SL) tissues, and 22 normal (N) livers. High-throughput miR mimic screens were performed in 3 primary human cholangiocyte cultures. Integration of patient transcriptomes and miRseq together with miR screening data identified an oncogenic miR for characterization. MiR-mRNA interaction was investigated by luciferase assay. MiR-CRISPR knockout (KO) cells were generated and phenotypically characterized in vitro (proliferation, migration, colony, mitochondrial function, glycolysis) and in vivo by subcutaneous xenografts.Results:In total, 13% (140/1049) of detected miRs were differentially expressed between CCA and SL, including 135 upregulated in tumours. CCA tissues were characterised by higher miRNome heterogeneity and miR biogenesis pathway expression. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tumour miRNomes identified three subgroups, including dCCA-enriched and IDH1 mutant-enriched subgroups. High-throughput screening of miR mimics uncovered 71 miRs that consistently increased proliferation of 3 primary cholangiocyte models and were upregulated in CCA tissues regardless of anatomical location, among which only miR-27a-3p had consistently increased expression and activity in several cohorts. FoxO signalling was predominantly downregulated by miR-27a-3p in CCA, partially through targeting of FOXO1. MiR-27a KO increased FOXO1 levels in vitro and in vivo, impeding tumour behaviour and growth.Conclusions:The miRNomes of CCA tissues are highly remodelled, impacting transcriptome homeostasis in part through regulation of transcription factors like FOXO1. MiR-27a-3p arises as oncogenic vulnerability in CCA.","BackgroundCholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant epithelial tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis. Given the lack of therapeutic strategies and durable treatment options currently available, identifying innovative treatments for CCA is an urgent unmet clinical need. Cucurbitacin C (CuC) is a distinct variant of the cucurbitacin family, displaying promising anti-cancer activity against various tumor types. The primary objective of our research is to elucidate the promising effects of CuC on CCA.MethodsThe impact of CuC on CCA cell lines was assessed by cell count kit-8 assay, EdU staining assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing assay, and Transwell assay. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted to explore the function of CuC treatments on cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis in CCA cells. Computational biology and network pharmacology approaches were utilized to predict potential targets of CuC. Furthermore, a tumor xenograft mouse model was established using CCA cells to explore the anti-cancer effects of CuC in vivo.ResultsOur research findings revealed that CuC exerted a suppressive effect on CCA cell progression. Cell viability assays, EdU staining assays, and colony formation assays demonstrated that CuC effectively suppressed viability and proliferation of CCA cells. Wound-healing assays and Transwell assays indicated that CuC effectively inhibits the migratory and invasive capabilities of CCA cells. Flow cytometry analysis elucidated that CuC played its anti-proliferative role in CCA cells by arresting G0/G1 phase and increasing apoptosis. Through bioinformatics and network pharmacology analysis, in conjunction with western blot analysis, we demonstrated CuC mediated the inhibition of CCA cell progression through modulation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Additionally, the CCA xenograft tumor model was established, and the results supported the inhibition of CuC treatment against CCA progression in vivo.ConclusionOur study demonstrates that CuC possesses notable capabilities to suppress cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CCA. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of CuC on CCA progression are attributed to its modulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Altogether, our study demonstrated that CuC holds promise as a prospective therapeutic agent for treating CCA.",1
"AbstractBiomaterials often have subtle properties that ultimately drive their bespoke performance. Given this nuanced structure–function behavior, the standard scientific approach of one experiment at a time or design of experiment methods is largely inefficient for the discovery of complex biomaterials. More recently, high-throughput experimentation coupled with machine learning methods has matured beyond expert users allowing scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds to access these powerful data science tools. As a result, we now have the opportunity to strategically utilize all available data from high-throughput experiments to train efficacious models and map the structure-function behavior of biomaterials for their discovery. Herein, we discuss this necessary shift to data-driven determination of structure–function properties of biomaterials as we highlight how machine learning is leveraged in identifying physicochemical cues for biomaterials in tissue engineering, gene delivery, drug delivery, protein stabilization, and antifouling materials. We also discuss data-mining approaches that are coupled with machine learning to map biomaterial functions that reduce the load on experimental approaches for faster biomaterial discovery. Ultimately, harnessing the prowess of machine learning will lead to accelerated discovery and development of optimal biomaterial designs.","Aim: Cu2O nanoparticles were synthesized using an extract from S. latifolium algae (SLCu2O NPs).

"PurposeItraconazole is an antifungal drug that has been clinically used for over 30 years. In recent years, scholars have discovered that it possesses an anticancer effect. Moreover, its mechanism has been clarified to some degree. What deserves to be mentioned is that itraconazole acting on the Hedgehog pathway has made a new progress in the treatment of cancers. While interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the Hedgehog pathway is largely activated in different cancer cells.ResultThis review tries to highlight the effect of itraconazole on smoothened receptor (SMO) in the Hedgehog pathway, thereby reducing the glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) release and finally exhibiting a range of anticancer effects, promoting apoptosis of cancer cells, and inhibiting proliferation by indirect inhibition of NF-κB pathway and inflammation, moreover, promoting the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, inhibiting the expression of target genes transcribed by GLI such as BCL-2 and Cyclin-D1. Besides, itraconazole increases the number of Bnip3, subsequently, inducing the dissociation of the Beclin-1/BCL-2 binding complex, as a result of ultimately promoting autophagy of cancer cells.ConclusionAs a new anticancer drug, whether itraconazole eventually entering clinical application requires the joint eforts of all scholars. In any case, an in-depth study on itraconazole will bring new hope for cancer patients in the near future.","With improved systemic treatment and prolonged survival even with metastatic disease, diagnosing, treating, and monitoring brain metastases has become a central topic in the care of patients with melanoma. Patients with brain metastases from melanoma are typically excluded from pivotal clinical trials. When allowed, inclusion and exclusion criteria are rather selective and do not reflect the larger population of melanoma patients with brain metastases who frequently present with neurological symptoms and signs and require steroid medications. Moreover, the lack of consensus on reporting symptomatic brain involvement complicates the interpretation and implications of trial results for the overall population of patients with melanoma and brain metastasis. Here, we review the evidence regarding brain metastasis from melanoma and discuss the challenges of longitudinal neurological clinical assessments, including tools to capture cognition and quality of life. Finally, we propose the adoption of standardized tools to interpret neurological deficits in patients with melanoma and brain metastases and to assess the neurological status in the context of clinical trials.",0
"BackgroundSkin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive disease with a poor prognosis for advanced tumors. Anoikis is a caspase-dependent cell death process triggered by extracellular matrix (ECM) detachment, rectifies detachment-induced metabolic defects that compromise cell survival, recent study revealed the crucial role of anoikis for cancer cells to survive during metastasis. However, limited research focused on the role of anoikis in SKCM.MethodsOur study utilized the 27 anoikis-related genes (ARGs) to divide SKCM patients into two clusters, and obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each cluster. These DEGs were used in stepwise Cox regression analysis to develop a prediction model for SKCM patients consisting of nine ARGs, called the anoikis-related signature (ARS). Subsequently, we used the risk scores calculated from the ARS to divide SKCM patients into two groups and explored differences in immune microenvironment, immune checkpoint reactivity, and drug sensitivity between the groups.ResultsNine ARGs were identified to stratify SKCM patients into two risk groups, patients in the high-risk group had a poor prognosis and suppressed immune cell infiltration. Moreover, higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules and a greater sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy drugs were observed in the low-risk group. Finally, all of the ARS hub genes were found to be upregulated in SKCM tissues and cell lines.ConclusionA novel ARGs signature was identified for predicting the prognosis of SKCM. Based on the immune landscape associated with ARS discovered in our study, targeting ARS hub genes may be a promising treatment for SKCM.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05468-6.","PurposeDisulfidptosis is a novel type of cell death induced by disulphide stress that depends on the accumulation of cystine disulphide, causing cytotoxicity and triggering cell death. However, the direct prognostic effect and regulatory mechanism of disulfidptosis-related genes in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) remain unclear.MethodsTo explore the role of 10 disulfidptosis-related genes, the multiomic data of 10 genes were comprehensively analysed. Next, based on seven disulfidptosis-related differentially expressed genes, a novel disulfidptosis-related gene score was developed to help predict the prognosis of BLCA. Immunohistochemistry, EDU, Real-time PCR and western blot were used to verify the model.ResultsSignificant functional differences were found between the high- and low-risk score groups, and samples with a higher risk score were more malignant. Furthermore, the tumour exclusion and Tumour Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion scores of the high-risk score group were higher than those of the low-risk score group. The risk score was positively correlated with the expression of immune checkpoints. Drug sensitivity analyses revealed that the low-risk score group had a higher sensitivity to cisplatin, doxorubicin, docetaxel and gemcitabine than the high-risk score group. Moreover, the expression of the TM4SF1 was positively correlated with the malignancy degree of BLCA, and the proliferation ability of BLCA cells was reduced after knockdown TM4SF1.ConclusionThe present study results suggest that disulfidptosis-related genes influence the prognosis of BLCA through their involvement in immune cell infiltration. Thus, these findings indicate the role of disulfidptosis in BLCA and its potential regulatory mechanisms.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05235-7.",1
"AbstractPurposeHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is a critical biomarker in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). While the role of HER2-positive tumors in guiding targeted therapies is well-established, the clinical implications of HER2-low expression, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization-negative (ISH-negative), remain undetermined. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance and clinicopathological features of HER2-low AGC.Patients and methodsThis retrospective analysis involved patients with AGC treated with first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy from 2011 to 2020. Patients were categorized into HER2-zero (HER2 IHC 0), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-negative), and HER2-positive (IHC 2+/ISH-positive or 3+) groups.ResultsAmong 548 patients analyzed, 33.0%, 45.1%, and 21.8% were classified as HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive, respectively. The proportions of male patients, intestinal-type histology, esophagogastric junction/cardia involvement, metastatic disease status, ≥2 metastatic sites, liver metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and high serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels were gradually elevated in the HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive groups. Overall survival (median) was 13.8, 13.6, and 23.0 months, respectively, with a non-significant trend favoring HER2-positive over HER2-low (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.80; P = .0672). A delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival between the HER2-zero and HER2-low groups was observed, without reaching statistical significance (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.12; P = .2568).ConclusionPatients with HER2-low status exhibited intermediate and specific clinicopathological features within the HER2-negative category. In terms of prognosis, HER2-low patients showed a worsening trend compared with HER2-positive patients. This evidence implies that HER2-low status represents a distinct clinical subset, bridging the gap between the HER2-zero and HER2-positive profiles.","BackgroundOsteosarcoma is a common primary malignant tumour of the bone that usually occurs in children and adolescents. It is characterised by difficult treatment, recurrence and metastasis, and poor prognosis. Currently, the treatment of osteosarcoma is mainly based on surgery and auxiliary chemotherapy. However, for recurrent and some primary osteosarcoma cases, owing to the rapid progression of disease and chemotherapy resistance, the effects of chemotherapy are poor. With the rapid development of tumour-targeted therapy, molecular-targeted therapy for osteosarcoma has shown promise.PurposeIn this paper, we review the molecular mechanisms, related targets, and clinical applications of targeted osteosarcoma therapy. In doing this, we provide a summary of recent literature on the characteristics of targeted osteosarcoma therapy, the advantages of its clinical application, and development of targeted therapy in future. We aim to provide new insights into the treatment of osteosarcoma.ConclusionTargeted therapy shows potential in the treatment of osteosarcoma and may offer an important means of precise and personalised treatment in the future, but drug resistance and adverse effects may limit its application.",0
"Glioma is the primary malignant tumor with the highest incidence rate in the adult central nervous system. The application of bioinformatics methods to analyze the RNA sequences of multiple gliomas revealed that the CDT1 gene has a significant impact on the cell cycle of glioma cells. Subsequently, we comprehensively and systematically investigated the expression of CDT1 in gliomas through bioinformatics analysis, clinical tissue specimens, and in vitro functional experiments. Our study is the first to report the expression of CDT1 in glioma. Our findings demonstrate that CDT1 plays a crucial role in the proliferation and invasion of glioma. Additionally, our bioinformatics analysis identified several other genes and signaling pathways that are dysregulated in multifocal gliomas, providing potential targets for further research and drug development.","Background.In this study, we compared programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in primary tissue samples and its soluble form (sPD-L1) concentration in matched preoperative plasma samples from gastric cancer patients to understand the relationship between tissue and plasma PD-L1 expression and to determine its diagnostic and prognostic value.Methods.PD-L1 expression in tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and sPD-L1 concentration in plasma was quantified by ELISA. The levels of the CD274 gene, which encodes for PD-L1 protein, were examined as part of bulk tissue RNA-sequencing analyses. Additionally, we evaluated the association between sPD-L1 levels and various laboratory parameters, disease characteristics, and patient outcomes.Results.GC patients had significantly higher levels of sPD-L1 in their plasma (71.69 pg/mL) compared to healthy controls (35.34 pg/mL) (p<0.0001). Moreover, sPD-L1 levels were significantly correlated with tissue PD-L1 protein, CD274 mRNA expression, larger tumor size, advanced tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis. Elevated sPD-L1 levels (>103.5 ng/mL) were associated with poor overall survival (HR=2.16, 95%CI 1.15–4.08, p=0.017). Furthermore, intratumoral neutrophil and dendritic cell levels were directly correlated with plasma sPD-L1 concentration in the GC patients.Conclusions.sPD-L1 was readily measurable in GC patients, and its level was associated with GC tissue PD-L1 expression, greater immune cell infiltration, disease progression, and survival. Thus, sPD-L1 may be a useful minimally invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in GC patients.",1
"BackgroundTelomeres are involved in the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC). However, the association of telomerase regulation-related lncRNAs with prognosis and immunotherapy responsiveness in gastric cancer is unclear.MethodsThis study systematically evaluated the relationship between lncRNAs co-expressed with 67 telomerase regulatory genes and gastric cancer prognosis. The risk scores of the samples were calculated based on telomerase regulation-related lncRNAs with prognostic value, and the samples were classified into high-/low-risk groups. The prognostic value of risk groups was then evaluated, a GC prognostic prediction model based on risk groups and clinical characteristics was established, and the prediction accuracy of the model was clarified by receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves. Finally, the value of risk grouping in GC immunotherapy sensitivity was predicted by comparing MSI status and tumor mutation load between the high- and low-risk groups.ResultsWe identified 13 lncRNAs with prognostic value co-expressed with telomerase regulatory genes and observed that the prognosis of the low-risk group was significantly better than that of the high-risk group. Meanwhile, a GC overall survival (OS) prediction model based on risk grouping and clinical characteristics was developed, and ROC curves and calibration curves confirmed the good predictive ability of the model. In addition, the low-risk group exhibited a higher tumor mutation load and MSI-H, suggesting a possible benefit of immunotherapy.ConclusionWe found that telomerase regulation-related lncRNAs have prognostic value in GC patients and contribute to the exploration of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04456-6.","DNA nanostructures have been widely researched in recent years as emerging biomedical materials for drug delivery, biosensing, and cancer therapy, in addition to their hereditary function. Multiple precisely designed single-strand DNAs can be fabricated into complex, three-dimensional DNA nanostructures through a simple self-assembly process. Among all of the synthetic DNA nanostructures, tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) stand out as the most promising biomedical nanomaterial. TDNs possess the merits of structural stability, cell membrane permeability, and natural biocompatibility due to their compact structures and DNA origin. In addition to their inherent advantages, TDNs were shown to have great potential in delivering therapeutic agents through multiple functional modifications. As a multifunctional material, TDNs have enabled innovative pharmaceutical applications, including antimicrobial therapy, anticancer treatment, immune modulation, and cartilage regeneration. Given the rapid development of TDNs in the biomedical field, it is critical to understand how to successfully produce and fine-tune the properties of TDNs for specific therapeutic needs and clinical translation. This article provides insights into the synthesis and functionalization of TDNs and summarizes the approaches for TDN-based therapeutics delivery as well as their broad applications in the field of pharmaceutics and nanomedicine, challenges, and future directions.",0
"ObjectivesThe project is designed to compare the clinical efficacy and adverse events resulting from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).MethodsPubMed Database and ClinicalTrials.gov were both searched to identify randomized controlled clinical trials for assessing ICIs in all-stage SCLC. After screening in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible studies were evaluated in regard to the population, intervention, comparator, outcome as well as study design (PICOS) pattern. Furthermore, primary endpoints of these randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and complete/objective response rate (CRR/ORR). Statistical analyses were realized via Review Manager Version 5.3 Software.ResultsCompared with the chemotherapy alone group, the ICIs plus chemotherapy group significantly improved with respect to such indicators as OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.90, P < 0.0001), PFS (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.87, P < 0.00001) and ORR (64.7% versus 59.1%). According to the safety analysis, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) at all grades was higher in ICIs plus chemotherapy group (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.20–2.10, P = 0.001), bearing no statistical significance at grade 3 or above (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.99–1.49, P = 0.07).ConclusionsThe combination of ICIs and chemotherapy witnessed better anti-neoplastic efficacy for SCLC. Moreover, the incidence of trAEs at all grades was elevated in ICIs plus chemotherapy group, with little discrepancy in both groups at grade 3 or above.","SummaryBackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by low immunogenicity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. LOAd703, an oncolytic adenovirus with transgenes encoding TMZ-CD40L and 4–1BBL, lyses cancer cells selectively, activates cytotoxic T-cells, and induces tumor regression in preclinical models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of combining LOAd703 with chemotherapy for advanced PDAC.MethodsAdult subjects with previously treated or treatment-naïve unresectable or metastatic PDAC were treated with standard 28-day cycles of intravenous nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine and biweekly intratumoral injections of LOAd703 at 5×1010 (DL1), 1×1011 (DL2), or 5×1011 (DL3) viral particles/injection. The primary endpoints were toxicity and treatment-emergent immune response in subjects who received at least one dose of LOAd703 (the safety-evaluable population) and determination of a dose suitable for subsequent investigation. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02705196).FindingsTwenty-one and 18 subjects (62% male, 76% white, 14% African-American, 10% Asian) recruited between December 2, 2016 and October 17, 2019 were evaluable for safety and activity, respectively, based on predefined definitions of evaluability. Median follow-up time was 6 (IQR 4–10) months, and data cutoff was January 5, 2023. The most common adverse events attributed to LOAd703 were fever, fatigue, chills, and elevated liver enzymes, all of which were grade 1/2 except for a transient grade 3 transaminase elevation occurring at DL3. MTD was not reached, thereby establishing DL3 as the highest-evaluated safe dose combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. Proportions of CD8+ effector memory cells and adenovirus-specific T-cells increased after LOAd703 injections in >90% of subjects.InterpretationCombining LOAd703 with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced PDAC was feasible. At the highest dose level, LOAd703 was safe while inducing immune responses and demonstrating sufficient anticancer activity for further development. To build upon this novel chemoimmunotherapeutic approach, an ongoing non-randomised trial is combining LOAd703, nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, and atezolizumab.FundingThis study was sponsored by Lokon Pharma and funded additionally by the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Research Council, and NIH Cancer Center Support Grant P30CA125123.",0
"BackgroundIncreasing studies have demonstrated the biological function of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in tumorigenesis. However, the potential role of m6A modifications in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.MethodsHerein, 23 m6A regulators were fetched and introduced into consensus clustering to identify distinct m6A modification patterns and develop m6A-based molecular signatures. Then, a principal component analysis algorithm was employed to construct an m6A-based scoring system to further quantify m6A modification patterns in individual tumors. Immunophenoscore (IPS) was used to estimate the immunotherapeutic response of patients.ResultsThree different m6A modification patterns with distinct prognoses and biological signatures were identified among 611 HCC samples. The TIME characteristics of these three patterns were consistent with three known immune profiles: immune-oasis, immune-excluded, and immune-inflamed phenotypes. Identifying m6A modification patterns within individual tumors based on the m6Ascore, developed under the m6A-related signature genes, contributed to elaborating biological processes, clinical outcomes, immune cell infiltration, immunotherapeutic effects, and genetic variations. The low-m6Ascore subtype, characterized by immunosuppression, suggested an immune-suppressed phenotype and a low probability of benefiting from immunotherapy. Finally, the potential function of PRDM4 in HCC was explored.ConclusionThis study comprehensively elucidated the indispensable role of m6A modification patterns in the complexity of TIME. The quantitative identification of m6A modification patterns in individual tumors will contribute to optimizing precision immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04255-z.","PurposeWe aimed to investigate the molecular characteristics of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) by analyzing ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) expression data to predict prognosis.MethodsGene expression and clinicopathological data of patients with CESC were collected from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression databases. Using Cox regression analysis, we identified 21 FRGs associated with prognosis. Cluster analysis categorized patients into subgroups based on these genes and compared their clinicopathological, biological, and immune infiltration features. FRG methylation levels were examined, and a risk model based on such FRG methylation levels was constructed using LASSO and Cox regression analyses. The model’s predictive capacity was validated, and the relationships between the risk score and immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment, and drug sensitivity were explored. FRG methylation in CESC tissues was validated by immunohistochemistry.ResultsWe identified 21 FRGs associated with CESC prognosis. Patients were stratified into two subtypes based on these genes, they showed differences in prognosis, immune cell types, and immune checkpoint expression. A three-gene risk score (including AQP3, MGST1, and TFRC) was generated, and the low-risk group showed better overall survival. The high-risk and low-risk groups differed in terms of immune infiltration, gene mutations, and drug sensitivity. Experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of AQP3 and TFRC, whereas MGST1 expression was not significantly altered in CESC tissues compared with that in normal cervical tissues.ConclusionThis study highlights the potential role of FRG methylation in predicting CESC prognosis and provides a personalized assessment of immune responses in patients with CESC.",1
"Introduction:Glioblastoma patients have a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and systemic immunosuppression that comprise a major barrier to immune checkpoint therapy. Based on the production of endocannabinoids by glioblastomas, we explored involvement of endocannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), encoded by the CNR2 gene, which is predominantly expressed by immune cells, in glioblastoma-related immunosuppression.Materials & Methods:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases was used to correlate enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, as well as CB2Rs, with patient overall survival. Intrastriatal administration of luciferase-expressing, murine GL261 glioblastoma cells was used to establish in in vivo glioblastoma model for characterization of tumor growth and intratumoral immune cell infiltration, as well as provide immune cells for in vitro co-culture experiments. Involvement of CB2Rs was determined by treatment with CB2R agonist (GW405833) or CB2R antagonist (AM630). ELISA, FACS, and immunocytochemistry were used to determine perforin, granzyme B, and surface marker levels.Results:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases showed high expression of CB2R and elevated endocannabinoid production correlated with poorer prognosis, and involved immune-associated pathways. AM630treatment of GL261 glioblastoma-bearing mice induced a potent antitumor response, with survival plateauing at 50% on Day 40, when all control mice (median survival 28 days) and mice treated with GW405833 (median survival 21 days) had died. Luciferase tumor imaging revealed accelerated tumor growth by GW405833 treatment, but stable or regressing tumors in AM630-treated mice. Notably, in spleens, AM630 treatment caused an 83% decrease in monocytes/macrophages, and 1.8- and 1.6-fold increases in CD8+ and CD4+ cells, respectively. Within tumors, there was a corresponding decrease in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increase in CD8+ T cells. In vitro, lymphocytes from AM630-treated mice showed greater cytotoxic function (increased percentage of perforin- and granzyme B-positive CD8+ T cells).Discussion:These results suggest that inhibition of CB2R enhances both immunosuppressive TAM infiltration and systemic T-cell suppression through CB2R activation, and that inhibition of CB2Rs can potently counter both the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, as well as systemic immunosuppression in glioblastoma.","AbstractHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most prevalent and dangerous cancers in the world, which is associated with hepatitis and fibrosis resulting from different etiologies, such as hepatitis B and C virus, alcohol and diabetes. Chronic inflammation is suggested to promote tumorigenesis and progression by producing inflammatory cytokines and free radicals, triggering malignant transformation of cells, promoting tumor cells proliferation and inducing tumor angiogenesis. Immunosuppressive microenvironment established in the liver also plays a vital role in HCC development. The mechanisms include activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts, upregulation of pattern recognition receptors, inhibition of effector T cells, recruitment of regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, activation of hepatic stellate cells and immunosuppressive M2 macrophages. In this review, we will summarize the most recent studies and discuss the advanced mechanisms of chronic inflammatory microenvironment and immunosuppressive microenvironment promoting HCC development, aiming to explore potential therapeutic targets.",1
"Objectives.To comprehensively investigate nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment, overall survival (OS), and the influence of clinical/sociodemographic factors on outcome.Study Design.Retrospective database study.Setting.National Cancer Database.Methods.The 2004–2015 National Cancer Database was queried for all patients with NPC receiving definitive treatment. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were used for statistical analyses.Results.A total of 8260 patients with NPC were included (71.4% male; 42.5% with keratinizing histology; mean ± SD age, 52.1 ± 15.1 years), with a 5-year OS of 63.4%. Multivariate predictors of mortality included age ≥65 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81; P < .001), Charlson/Deyo score ≥1 (HR, 1.27; P = .001), American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical stage III to IV (HR, 1.85; P < .001), and government insurance or no insurance (HR, 1.53; P < .001). Predictors of survival included female sex (HR, 0.82; P = .002), Asian/Pacific Islander race (HR, 0.74; P <.001), nonkeratinizing/undifferentiated histology (HR, 0.79; P = .004), and receiving treatment at academic centers (HR, 0.87; P = .02). Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) demonstrated improved OS as compared with radiotherapy (RT) only for stage II (P = .006) and stage III (P = .005) and with RT or chemotherapy only in stage IVA NPC (P < .001). When compared with CRT alone, surgery plus CRT provided OS benefits in keratinizing (P = .013) or stage IVA (P = .030) NPC. When compared with RT, CRT provided OS benefits in keratinizing (P = .005) but not nonkeratinizing (P = .240) or undifferentiated (P = .390) NPC. Substandard radiation dosing of <60 Gy and <30 fractions were associated with inferior OS (both P <.001).Conclusions.NPC survival is dependent on a variety of clinical/sociodemographic factors. Stage-specific treatments with optimal OS include CRT or RT for stages I to II and CRT for stage III to IV. The large representation of nonendemic histology is valuable, as these cases are not well characterized.","Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal and fast-growing cancers with a poor prognosis. Herein, we report the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a new prognostic biomarker in pancreatic cancer progression analysis at the clinical level. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 86 clinically proven cases of pancreatic cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) using anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Histoscore was done, and a variety of cutoffs were identified for analyses of the results. The chi-square test and Kaplan–Meier method were used to find the association between pancreatic cancer and various clinicopathological variables and the overall survival of the patients. PD-L1 expression was associated with histological grade and recurrence of the disease for epithelial and stromal staining at 10 histoscores. In addition, PD-L1 expression was strongly associated with lymph node involvement at the stromal 20 histoscore. The tumor stage of pancreatic cancer had an association with PD-L1 expression with epithelial and stromal 20 histoscores for all comparisons. At a stromal 20 histoscore, overall survival in high-low expression of PD-L1 was 7–19 months, and at a nuclear/cytoplasmic 10 histoscore, it was 9–28 months (p = 0.0001), respectively. Overall, PD-L1 overexpression in subcellular compartments was associated with disease aggression phenotypes and poor patient survival. Overexpression of PD-L1 was directly linked to pancreatic cancer progression and a poor survival rate. Therefore, PD-L1 may be used as a prognostic biomarker in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of pancreatic cancer patients.",1
"Molecular targeted therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by significantly improving patient survival compared with standard conventional chemotherapies. The use of these drugs targets specific molecules or targets, which block growth and spread of cancer cells. Many of these therapies have been approved for use with remarkable success in breast, blood, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancers. The advantage over conventional chemotherapy is its ability to deliver drugs effectively with high specificity while being less toxic. Although known as “targeted,” many of these agents lack specificity and selectivity, and they tend to inhibit multiple targets, including those in the kidneys. The side effects usually arise because of dysregulation of targets of the inhibited molecule in normal tissue. The off-target effects are caused by drug binding to unintended targets. The on-target effects are associated with inhibition toward the pathway reflecting inappropriate inhibition or activation of the intended drug target. Early detection and correct management of kidney toxicities is crucial to preserve kidney functions. The knowledge of these toxicities helps guide optimal and continued utilization of these potent therapies. This review summarizes the different types of molecular targeted therapies used in the treatment of cancer and the incidence, severity, and pattern of nephrotoxicity caused by them, with their plausible mechanism and proposed treatment recommendations.","Aim: To develop and validate a T2-weighted-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) images-based radiomics model for predicting early postoperative recurrence (within 1 year) in patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs).Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed by collecting clinical, pathological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from patients with LGG between 2017 and 2022. Regions of interest were delineated and radiomic features were extracted from T2-FLAIR images using 3D-Slicer software. To minimize redundant features, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression algorithm was used. Patients were categorized into two groups based on recurrence status: the recurrence group (RG) and the non-recurrence group (NRG). Radiomic features were used to develop models using three machine learning approaches: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the radiomic features was validated using fivefold cross-validation.Results: After rigorous screening, 105 patients met the inclusion criteria, and five radiomic features were identified. After 5-folds cross-validation, the average areas under the curves for LR, RF and SVM were 0.813, 0.741 and 0.772, respectively.Conclusion: T2-FLAIR-based radiomic features effectively predicted early recurrence in postoperative LGGs.",0
"SUMMARYThe CD93/IGFBP7 axis proteins are key factors expressed in endothelial cells (EC) that mediate EC angiogenesis and migration. Their upregulation contributes to tumor vascular abnormality and a blockade of this interaction promotes a favorable tumor microenvironment for therapeutic interventions. However, the interactions of these proteins with each other remain unclear. In this study, we determined a partial structure of the human CD93–IGFBP7 complex comprising the EGF1 domain of CD93 and the IB domain of IGFBP7. Mutagenesis studies confirmed interactions and specificities. Cellular and mouse tumor studies demonstrated the physiological relevance of the CD93–IGFBP7 interaction in EC angiogenesis. Our study provides leads for the development of therapeutic agents to precisely disrupt unwanted CD93–IGFBP7 signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, analysis of the CD93 full-length architecture provides insights into how CD93 protrudes on the cell surface and forms a flexible platform for binding to IGFBP7 and other ligands.","PurposeTo investigate oncological outcomes and patterns of recurrence of patients undergoing adjuvant “sandwich” chemo-radio-chemotherapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer.MethodsThis is a multi-institutional retrospective study evaluating chart of consecutive patients undergoing chemo-radio-chemotherapy for FIGO stage III–IVA endometrial caner.ResultsThe study population included 45 patients who had adjuvant sandwich regimen. Median age of the study population was 66 years. The majority of patients were diagnosed with endometrioid histology and with stage III disease. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 15 patients developed recurrent disease. Three-year disease-free and overall survivals was 45% and 81%, respectively. Three-years site-specific disease-free survival was 85%, 92% and 48% for local, loco-regional, and distant recurrence, respectively. All patients included in the study had nodal dissection. Nodal assessment included: sentinel node mapping, sentinel node mapping plus backup lymphadenectomy and lymphadenectomy in 15, 6 and 24 patients, respectively. The latter group included four patients detected by suspected enlarged nodes, intraoperatively. Even after the exclusion of patients with enlarged nodes, the type of nodal assessment did not impact on survival outcomes (p > 0.2). Positive peritoneal cytology was the only factor associated with an increased risk of developing (any site) recurrence and distant-specific recurrence, independently. No factor predicted for overall survival.ConclusionAdjuvant “sandwich” chemo-radio-chemotherapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer guarantee promising local and loco-regional controls, but distant failure rate is high, thus suggesting the need for applying other systemic treatment strategies for these patients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03339-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"PurposeColon cancer presents challenges to clinical diagnosis and management due to its high heterogeneity. For more efficient and convenient diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer, we are committed to characterizing the molecular features of colon cancer by pioneering a classification system based on metabolic pathways.MethodsBased on the 113 metabolic pathways and genes collected in the previous stage, we scored and filtered the metabolic pathways of each sample in the training set by ssGSEA, and obtained 16 metabolic pathways related to colon cancer recurrence. In consistent clustering of training set samples with recurrence-related metabolic pathway scores, we identified two robust molecular subtypes of colon cancer (MC1 and MC2). Furthermore, we performed multi-angle analysis on the survival differences of subtypes, metabolic characteristics, clinical characteristics, functional enrichment, immune infiltration, differences with other subtypes, stemness indices, TIDE prediction, and drug sensitivity, and finally constructed colon cancer prognostic model.ResultsThe results showed that the MC1 subtype had a poor prognosis based on higher immune activity and immune checkpoint gene expression. The MC2 subtype is associated with high metabolic activity and low expression of immune checkpoint genes and a better prognosis. The MC2 subtype was more responsive to PD-L1 immunotherapy than the MC1 subclass. However, we did not observe significant differences in tumor mutational burden between the two.ConclusionTwo molecular subtypes of colon cancer based on metabolic pathways have distinct immune signatures. Constructing prognostic models based on subtype differential genes provides valuable reference for personalized therapy targeting unique tumor metabolic signatures.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04070-6.","PurposeIn recent times, multiple molecular subtypes with varying prognoses have been identified in bladder cancer (BLCA). However, the attributes of butyrate metabolism-related (BMR) molecular subtypes and their correlation with immunotherapy response remain inadequately explored in BLCA.MethodsWe utilized 594 samples of BLCA to investigate the molecular subtypes mediated by BMR genes and their correlation with the immunotherapy response. To quantify the BMR features of individual tumors, we developed a BMR score through the COX and LASSO regression methods. Clinical-related, tumor microenvironment, drug-sensitive and immunotherapy analyses were used to comprehensively analyze BMR scores.ResultsTwo distinct molecular subtypes related to butyrate metabolism were identified in BLCA, each with unique prognostic implications and immune microenvironments. BMR score was constructed based on 7 BMR genes and was used to classify the patients into two score groups. Clinical analysis revealed that the BMR score was an independent prognostic factor. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. The BMR score can also predict tumor immunity. The results demonstrated that a low BMR score was associated with higher efficacy of immunotherapy, which was also validated by an external dataset.ConclusionOur study proposes both molecular subtypes and a BMR-based score as promising prognostic classifications in BLCA. These findings may offer new insights for the development of precise targeted cancer therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05067-5.",1
"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification. M6A RNA methylation is reversible: m6A is installed by “writers”, removed by “erasers”, and recognized by “readers”. Readers are executors to regulate RNA metabolism by recognizing specific m6A sites, including RNA splicing, export, translation and decay. YTHDF2 is the first identified m6A reader protein. YTHDF2 interacts with m6A-containing transcripts to accelerate the degradation process and regulate various biological processes, such as viral infection, stem cell development and cancer progression. Although there are some reviews about m6A modification in physiological and pathological processes, few reviews focus on roles of YTHDF2 in cancers to date. Therefore, in this review, we attempted to systematically summarize m6A reader protein YTHDF2: its structure, mechanisms in regulating RNA metabolism, roles in cancer progression and potential application for cancer treatment, which might inspire new ideas for m6A research in cancers and provide novel insights into cancer treatment.","Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) has been regarded as the rarest form of thyroid malignancy, which entails around 2% of thyroid malignancies. It traditionally presents with rapidly enlarging anterior neck swelling with obstructive symptoms. Due to its rich blood supply and lymphatic drainage, the thyroid gland is resistant to infection. Parallel to that, the presentation of thyroid abscess frequently points towards an underlying upper respiratory tract infection. We present a case involving an elderly female presenting with a thyroid abscess, which later turned out to be ATC following a histopathological diagnosis of the thyroid gland. The initial cytology workout was negative for malignancy. We highlight the relatively uncommon presentation along with its management.",0
"BackgroundMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a heterogeneous disease in which molecular stratification is needed to improve clinical outcomes. The identification of predictive biomarkers can have a major impact on the care of these patients, but the availability of metastatic tissue samples for research in this setting is limited.ObjectiveTo study the prevalence of immune biomarkers of potential clinical utility to immunotherapy in mCRPC and to determine their association with overall survival (OS).Design, setting, and participantsFrom 100 patients, mCRPC biopsies were assayed by whole exome sequencing, targeted next-generation sequencing, RNA sequencing, tumor mutational burden, T-cell–inflamed gene expression profile (TcellinfGEP) score (Nanostring), and immunohistochemistry for programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), SRY homology box 2 (SOX2), and the presence of neuroendocrine features.Outcome measurements and statistical analysisThe phi coefficient determined correlations between biomarkers of interest. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) from Cox regression.Results and limitationsPD-L1 and SOX2 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (combined positive score ≥1 and >5% cells, respectively) in 24 (33%) and 27 (27%) mCRPC biopsies, respectively; 23 (26%) mCRPC biopsies had high TcellinfGEP scores (>–0.318). PD-L1 protein expression and TcellinfGEP scores were positively correlated (phi 0.63 [0.45; 0.76]). PD-L1 protein expression (aHR: 1.90 [1.05; 3.45]), high TcellinfGEP score (aHR: 1.86 [1.04; 3.31]), and SOX2 expression (aHR: 2.09 [1.20; 3.64]) were associated with worse OS.ConclusionsPD-L1, TcellinfGEP score, and SOX2 are prognostic of outcome from the mCRPC setting. If validated, predictive biomarker studies incorporating survival endpoints need to take these findings into consideration.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) tumors have a highly immunosuppressive desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME) where immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy has been exceptionally ineffective. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor activation leads to cancer and immune cell proliferation and phenotype, and cytokine production leading to tumor progression and worse overall survival in PDA patients. We hypothesized that TGF-β receptor inhibition may alter PDA progression and antitumor immunity in the TME. Here, we used a syngeneic preclinical murine model of PDA to explore the impact of TGF-β pathway inhibitor galunisertib (GAL), dual checkpoint immunotherapy (anti-PD-L1 and CTLA-4), the chemotherapy gemcitabine (GEM), and their combinations on antitumor immune responses. Blockade of TGF-β and ICI in immune-competent mice bearing orthotopically injected murine PDA cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and was accompanied by antitumor M1 macrophage infiltration. In contrast, GEM treatment resulted in increased PDA tumor growth, decreased antitumor M1 macrophages, and decreased cytotoxic CD8+ T cell subpopulation compared to control mice. Together, these findings demonstrate the ability of TGF-β inhibition with GAL to prime antitumor immunity in the TME and the curative potential of combining GAL with dual ICI. These preclinical results indicate that targeted inhibition of TGF-β may enhance the efficacy of dual immunotherapy in PDA. Optimal manipulation of the immune TME with non-ICI therapy may enhance therapeutic efficacy.",1
"Introduction:Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) shows benefits in adjuvant (AT) and neoadjuvant (NAT) melanoma treatments. However, ICI frequently induces severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Unlike metastatic disease, where irAEs are a clinical trade-off for treatment that improves survival, the toxicity burden from ICI in AT is a substantial clinical problem urging for irAE-predictive biomarkers.Methods:We assessed post-surgical, pre-ICI treatment peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from clinical trial patients (CheckMate-915) treated with AT nivolumab (NIVO, n=130) or ipilimumab/nivolumab (COMBO, n=82). Performing RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis we tested baseline differences associated with severe (grade 3-5) irAEs and constructed an irAE-predictive model using LASSO-regularized logistic regression.Results:The analysis of predicted protein-protein interactions among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in peripheral CD4+ cells revealed significant enrichment of the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) pathway, associated with severe irAEs in COMBO-treated patients. This gene-expression signature predicted severe-irAE COMBO patients (chi-square p-value=0.001) with 73% accuracy and was independent of disease recurrence (p=0.79). The irAE-predictive model incorporating this gene-expression signature demonstrated 82% accuracy (chi-square p-value=8.91E-06).Conclusions:We identified baseline gene-expression differences in key immune pathways of peripheral blood T cells from COMBO-treated patients with grade 3-5 irAEs, and defined a SYK-related gene signature correctly identifying ~60% of COMBO-treated patients with grade 3-5 irAE. This finding aligns with our previous work linking anti-CTLA-4 irAEs with a germline variant associated with high SYK expression. This gene signature may serve as a baseline biomarker of severe grade 3-5 irAE risk, which is especially important in AT.","Background:In this study, we compare outcomes of older patients with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (PCNSL) undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) with either thiotepa/carmustine (BCNU/Thio) or thiotepa/busulfan/cyclophosphamide (TBC) conditioning.Methods:We used a post-publication dataset made available by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Research (CIBMTR) including patients who were ≥65 years in age with PCNSL and underwent autoHCT as consolidation with TBC or BCNU/Thio conditioning.Results:Out of 147 patients; n=84 received BCNU/Thio and n=63 received TBC. The 1-year NRM in the BCNU/Thio group was 10% versus 22% in the TBC group (p=0.05) and the 2-year relapse rate was 5% versus 5%, respectively (p=1.00). The 2-year PFS in the BCNU/Thio group was 85% versus 71% in the TBC group (p=0.05) and 2-year OS was 86% vs 74% (p=0.08). In a multivariable regression model, BCNU/Thio was associated with a lower risk for NRM [Hazard Ratio (HR), 0.33, p=0.009], improved PFS (HR, 0.41, p=0.008) and OS (HR, 0.37, p=0.007), but there was no association with relapse risk.Conclusion:We found that in older adults with PCNSL undergoing consolidation with autoHCT, BCNU/Thio conditioning is associated with lower NRM and improved OS compared to TBC.",0
"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to compare response rates of lenvatinib and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, in first-line real-world setting.MethodsOverall cohort included Western and Eastern hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient populations from 46 centres in 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Japan, and Republic of Korea).Results1312 patients were treated with lenvatinib, and 823 patients were treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Objective response rate (ORR) was 38.6% for patients receiving lenvatinib, and 27.3% for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p < 0.01; odds ratio 0.60). For patients who achieved complete response (CR), overall survival (OS) was not reached in both arms, but the result from univariate Cox regression model showed 62% reduction of death risk for patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p = 0.05). In all multivariate analyses, treatment arm was not found to be an independent factor conditioning OS. Comparing ORR achieved in the two arms, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in all subgroups except for Eastern patients, Child–Pugh B patients, presence of portal vein thrombosis, α-feto-protein ≥ 400 ng/mL, presence of extrahepatic disease, albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2, and no previous locoregional procedures.ConclusionLenvatinib achieves higher ORR in all patient subgroups. Patients who achieve CR with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab can achieve OS so far never recorded in HCC patients. This study did not highlight any factors that could identify patient subgroups capable of obtaining CR.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04512-1.","Liver cancer is one of the most common malignancies. T-cell exhaustion is associated with immunosuppression of tumor and chronic infection. Although immunotherapies that enhance the immune response by targeting programmed cell death-1(PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been applied to malignancies, these treatments have shown limited response rates. This suggested that additional inhibitory receptors (IRs) also contributed to T-cell exhaustion and tumor prognosis. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) are usually in a dysfunctional state of exhaustion, such as impaired activity and proliferative ability, increased apoptosis rate, and reduced production of effector cytokines. Tex cells participate in the negative regulation of tumor immunity mainly through IRs on the cell surface, changes in cytokines and immunomodulatory cell types, causing tumor immune escape. However, T-cell exhaustion is not irreversible and targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can effectively reverse the exhaustion of T-cells and restore the anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, the research on the mechanism of T-cell exhaustion in liver cancer, aimed at maintaining or restoring the effector function of Tex cells, might provide a new method for the treatment of liver cancer. In this review, we summarized the basic characteristics of Tex cells (such as IRs and cytokines), discussed the mechanisms associated with T-cell exhaustion, and specifically discussed how these exhaustion characteristics were acquired and shaped by key factors within TME. Then new insights into the molecular mechanism of T-cell exhaustion suggested a potential way to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, namely to restore the effector function of Tex cells. In addition, we also reviewed the research progress of T-cell exhaustion in recent years and provided suggestions for further research.",0
"Glioma is the primary malignant tumor with the highest incidence rate in the adult central nervous system. The application of bioinformatics methods to analyze the RNA sequences of multiple gliomas revealed that the CDT1 gene has a significant impact on the cell cycle of glioma cells. Subsequently, we comprehensively and systematically investigated the expression of CDT1 in gliomas through bioinformatics analysis, clinical tissue specimens, and in vitro functional experiments. Our study is the first to report the expression of CDT1 in glioma. Our findings demonstrate that CDT1 plays a crucial role in the proliferation and invasion of glioma. Additionally, our bioinformatics analysis identified several other genes and signaling pathways that are dysregulated in multifocal gliomas, providing potential targets for further research and drug development.","With expansion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and broader utilization of anti-cytokine directed therapeutics for toxicity mitigation, the routine assessment of cytokines may enhance understanding of toxicity profiles, guide therapeutic interventions, and facilitate cross-trial comparisons. As specific cytokine elevations can correlate with and provide insights into CAR T cell toxicity, mitigation strategies, and response, we explored the reporting of cytokine detection methods and assessed for the correlation of cytokines to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) across clinical trials. In this analysis, we reviewed 21 clinical trials across 60 manuscripts that featured a US Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR T cell construct or one of its predecessors. We highlight substantial variability and limited reporting of cytokine measurement platforms and panels used across CAR T cell clinical trials. Specifically, across 60 publications, 28 (46.7%) did not report any cytokine data, representing 6 of 21 (28.6%) clinical trials. In the 15 trials reporting cytokine data, at least 4 different platforms were used. Furthermore, correlation of cytokines with ICANS, CRS, and CRS severity was limited. Considering the fundamental role of cytokines in CAR T cell toxicity, our manuscript supports the need to establish standardization of cytokine measurements as a key biomarker essential to improving outcomes of CAR T cell therapy.",1
"Background:Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early-stage breast cancer (EBC) is a heterogenous disease. Identification of better clinical and molecular biomarkers is essential to guide optimal therapy for each patient.Patients and methods:We analyzed rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) for patients with HR+/HER2-negative EBC in eight neoadjuvant arms in the I-SPY2 trial by clinical/molecular features: age, stage, histology, percentage estrogen receptor (ER) positivity, ER/progesterone receptor status, MammaPrint (MP)-High1 (0 to −0.57) versus MP-High2 (<−0.57), BluePrint (BP)-Luminal-type versus BP-Basal-type, and ImPrint immune signature. We quantified the clinical/molecular heterogeneity, assessed overlap among these biomarkers, and evaluated associations with pCR and DRFS.Results:Three hundred and seventy-nine patients with HR+/HER2-negative EBC were included in this analysis, with an observed pCR rate of 17% across treatment arms. pCR rates were higher in patients with stage II versus III disease (21% versus 9%, P = 0.0013), ductal versus lobular histology (19% versus 11%, P = 0.049), lower %ER positivity (≤66% versus >66%) (35% versus 9%, P = 3.4E-09), MP-High2 versus MP-High1 disease (31% versus 11%, P = 1.1E-05), BP-Basal-type versus BP-Luminal-type disease (34% versus 10%, P = 1.62E-07), and ImPrint-positive versus -negative disease (38% versus 10%, P = 1.64E-09). Patients with lower %ER were more likely to have MP-High2 and BP-Basal-type disease. At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, patients who achieved pCR had excellent outcomes irrespective of clinical/molecular features. Among patients who did not achieve pCR, DRFS events were more frequent in patients with MP-High2 and BP-Basal-type disease than those with MP-High1 and BP-Luminal-type disease.Conclusions:Among patients with high molecular-risk HR+/HER2-negative EBC, the MP-High2, BP-Basal-type, and ImPrint-positive signatures identified a partially overlapping subset of patients who were more likely to achieve Pcr in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± targeted agents or immunotherapy compared to patients with MP-High1, BP-Luminal-type, and ImPrint-negative disease. I-SPY2.2 is incorporating the use of these biomarkers to molecularly define specific patient populations and optimize treatment selection.","ABSTRACTAcute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous hematopoietic cancer prevalent in adults, has been a leading cause of leukemia-associated deaths for decades. Despite advancements in understanding its pathology and pharmacological targets, therapeutic strategies have seen minimal change. The standard treatment, combining cytarabine and anthracycline, has persisted, accompanied by challenges such as pharmacokinetic issues and non-specific drug delivery, leading to severe side effects. Nanotechnology offers a promising solution through combination drug delivery. FDA-approved CPX351 (VYXEOS™) a liposomal formulation delivering doxorubicin and cytarabine, exemplifies enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Ongoing research explores various nanocarriers for delivering multiple bioactives, addressing drug targeting, pharmacokinetics and chemoresistance.

"Colorectal cancer is one of the malignant tumors that pose a serious threat to human health. A particularly bad prognosis might be expected for colorectal tumors with the unique molecular subtype BRAF V600E mutation. With the development of precision therapy, the advent of molecularly targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors has improved the outcome of intermediate to advanced colorectal cancer. However, the duration of drug benefit is usually short, and overall survival and progression-free survival remain suboptimal. Therefore, investigators are exploring more rational, safe, and effective drug combination regimens through clinical trials to provide longer survival for patients with such genetic mutations with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This article reviews the progress of clinical research on molecularly targeted drugs, immune checkpoint inhibitors, first-line chemotherapeutic agents, and different combination therapy regimens (including different targeted drug combinations, immune combination targeting, and chemotherapy combination targeting) for colorectal cancer patients with BRAF V600E mutation, which provides a reference for further in-depth clinical exploration of the treatment of colorectal cancer patients with BRAF V600E mutation.","Introduction of fluorine into bioactive molecules has attracted much attention in drug development. For example, tetrafluorination of the phthalimide moiety of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) has a strong beneficial effect on the ability to inhibit angiogenesis. The neomorphic activity of E3 ligase complexes is induced by the binding of IMiDs to cereblon. We investigated that a set of eight thalidomide analogs, comprising non- and tetrafluorinated counterparts, did not induce the degradation of neomorphic substrates (IKZF3, GSPT1, CK1α, SALL4). Hence, the antiangiogenic activity of fluorinated IMiDs was not triggered by neosubstrate degradation features. A fluorine scanning of non-traditional IMiDs of the benzamido glutarimide chemotype was performed. By measuring the endothelial cell tube formation, no angiogenesis inhibitors were identified, confirming the narrow structure–activity window of IMiD-induced antiangiogenesis.",0
"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that detach from the original site and reach the bloodstream. The most aggressive CTCs survive various immune system attacks and initiate metastasis formation. Importantly, CTCs are not specifically targeted by the current immunotherapies due to the limited knowledge on specific targets. Proteomic profiling can be a powerful tool for understanding some of the immune evasion mechanisms used by cancer cells and particularly CTCs. These mechanisms are generally linked to the expression of specific surface proteins/peptides (that is the surfaceome). The study of the peptides that bind to class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC‐I) and of the various glycoproteins expressed on CTC surface may open a completely new avenue for the discovery of novel mechanisms of immune evasion. In this review, we discuss how immunopeptidomic and glycoproteomic studies of CTCs that interact with immune cells could help to better understand how metastasis‐initiator CTCs escape the host immune response. We also describe how immunopeptidomic and glycoproteomic studies are carried out.","Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in solid tumors. Despite Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of CTC devices in various cancers, the rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs in lung cancer make them technically challenging to isolate and analyze, hindering their clinical integration. Establishing a consensus through comparative analysis of different CTC systems is warranted. This study aimed to evaluate seven different CTC enrichment methods across five technologies using a standardized spike‐in protocol: the CellMag™ (EpCAM‐dependent enrichment), EasySep™ and RosetteSep™ (blood cell depletion), and the Parsortix® PR1 and the new design Parsortix® Prototype (PP) (size‐ and deformability‐based enrichment). The Parsortix® systems were also evaluated for any differences in recovery rates between cell harvest versus in‐cassette staining. Healthy donor blood (5 mL) was spiked with 100 fluorescently labeled EpCAMhigh H1975 cells, processed through each system, and the isolation efficiency was calculated. The CellMag™ had the highest recovery rate (70 ± 14%), followed by Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining, while the EasySep™ had the lowest recovery (18 ± 8%). Additional spike‐in experiments were performed with EpCAMmoderate A549 and EpCAMlow H1299 cells using the CellMag™ and Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining. The recovery rate of CellMag™ significantly reduced to 35 ± 14% with A549 cells and 1 ± 1% with H1299 cells. However, the Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining showed cell phenotype‐independent and consistent recovery rates among all lung cancer cell lines: H1975 (49 ± 2%), A549 (47 ± 10%), and H1299 (52 ± 10%). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining method is capable of isolating heterogeneous single CTCs and cell clusters from patient samples. The Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining, capable of isolating different phenotypes of CTCs as either single cells or cell clusters with consistent recovery rates, is considered optimal for CTC enrichment for lung cancer, albeit needing further optimization and validation.",1
"Aim: This study investigated the role of lncRNA LINC01232 in ferroptosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials & methods: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blot experiments were performed to examine relevant mRNAs and proteins expression. The kit assays evaluated malondialdehyde, iron, Fe2+ and glutathione levels. ROS levels were verified by flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation analysis monitored the correlation among LINC01232, H3K27ac, p300 and ARNTL2.Results: LINC01232 or ARNTL2 knockdown facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis. The interaction between LINC01232 and p300 resulted in the enhancement of H3K27ac levels at ARNTL2 promoter to promote ARNTL2 transcriptional activity. ARNTL2 overexpression reversed the promoting effect of LINC01232 knockdown on ferroptosis.Conclusion: LINC01232 inhibited the ferroptosis in CRC by epigenetically upregulating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL2.","Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody of VEGF, and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death function independently of the apoptotic machinery, has been accepted as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention; the ferroptosis pathway can enhance cell immune activity of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in HCC. In this study we investigated whether and how bevacizumab regulated ferroptosis and immune activity in liver cancer. Firstly, we performed RNA-sequencing in bevacizumab-treated human liver cancer cell line HepG2 cells, and found that bevacizumab significantly altered the expression of a number of genes including VEGF, PI3K, HAT1, SLC7A11 and IL-9 in liver cancer, bevacizumab upregulated 37 ferroptosis-related drivers, and downregulated 17 ferroptosis-related suppressors in particular. We demonstrated that bevacizumab triggered ferroptosis in liver cancer cells by driving VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/SLC7A11 axis. Clinical data confirmed that the expression levels of VEGF were positively associated with those of PI3K, HAT1 and SLC7A11 in HCC tissues. Meanwhile, we found that bevacizumab enhanced immune cell activity in tumor immune-microenvironment. We identified that HAT1 up-regulated miR-143 targeting IL-9 mRNA 3’UTR in liver cancer cells; bevacizumab treatment resulted in the increase of IL-9 levels and its secretion via VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/miR-143/IL-9 axis, which led to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo through increasing the release of IL-2 and Granzyme B from activated CD8+ T cells. We conclude that in addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer. This study provides new insight into the mechanisms by which bevacizumab synergistically modulates ferroptosis and CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer.",1
"Introduction:No definitive answers currently exist regarding optimal first-line therapy for HER2-mutant NSCLC. Access to rapid tissue sequencing is a major barrier to precision drug development in the first-line setting. ctDNA analysis has the potential to overcome these obstacles and guide treatment.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed patients with metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC who underwent prospective clinical ctDNA sequencing and received systemic therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) from January 2016 to September 2022. HER2 mutations were identified by next-generation sequencing through MSK-IMPACT, MSK-ACCESS or Resolution ctDx LungTM assay. Primary endpoints were time to the next treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS).Results:Sixty-three patients were included in the primary analysis. Chemoimmunotherapy (33/63, 52.4%) was the predominant first-line treatment with a median TTNT of 5.1 months (95%CI 4.1 – 6.1) whereas 55.0% (22/40) of patients who received second-line T-DXd obtained a median TTNT of 9.2m (95% CI, 0–22.2). Plasma ctDNA was tested before first-line therapy in 40 patients with a median OS of 28.0 months (95% CI 21–34), in whom 31 patients (78.0%) had detectable ctDNA. HER2 mutations were detected on ctDNA with a median turnaround time of 13 days, occasionally co-occurred with EGFR and MET alterations and were tracked longitudinally correlating with treatment response. Patients with detectable baseline ctDNA had significantly shorter OS (hazard ratio (HR), 5.25; 95% CI, 1.2–23.9; p = 0.019).Conclusion:Chemoimmunotherapy remains a major treatment option for metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC. ctDNA can rapidly detect HER2 and co-mutations, and it has the potential to guide and monitor optimal first-line therapy. As a negative prognostic biomarker, detectable ctDNA at baseline would need to be taken into account for patient selection in future studies.","PurposeThe importance of targeted therapy and interest in the study of predictive markers in gastric cancer (GC) have increased in recent years with the use of anti-HER2 therapy and immunotherapy with anti-PD1/PD-L1 for microsatellite instability (MSI) and PD-L1 + tumors. However, the behavior of remnant GC (RGC) in this scenario is poorly reported. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of RGC and its association with the expression of current markers for targeted therapy.MethodsAll RGC resections performed in a single center from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. As a comparison group, 53 primary proximal GC (PGC) who underwent total D2-gastrectomy were selected. HER2, MSI status and PD-L1 expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Combined Positive Score (CPS) was used to determine PD-L1 positivity.ResultsA total of 40 RGC were included. RGC patients were older (p = 0.001), had lower BMI (p = 0.001) and number of resected lymph nodes (p < 0.001) compared to the PGC. Regarding markers expression, MSI was higher in RGC than PGC (27.5% vs 9.4%, p = 0.022). The frequency of CPS-positive was 32.5% and 26.4% in RGC and PGC, respectively (p = 0.522). HER2 positivity was 17.5% and 22.6% for RGC and PGC, respectively (p = 0.543). In survival analysis, DFS was better for RGC CPS-positive than RGC CPS-negative (p = 0.039) patients. There was no difference in survival considering MSI status.ConclusionRGC had higher incidence of MSI than PGC, and CPS-positive RGC was associated with better survival. The immunological profile of RGC patients suggests that they would be good candidates for immunotherapy.",1
"Purpose:To assess safety and immune biomarkers after preoperative radiation therapy (RT) and anti-PD1 therapy in breast cancer.Materials and methods:A phase I/IIb trial of pembrolizumab with RT was conducted in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2−) breast cancer. All received pembrolizumab followed by a second cycle + RT (anti-PD1/RT) of 24 Gy/three daily fractions delivered to the breast tumor and then neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Blood and tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline, after anti-PD1, and after anti-PD-RT. Coprimary end points were safety and change in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Secondary end points were pathologic complete response (pCR), residual cancer burden (RCB) rates, and event-free survival (EFS).Results:Sixty-six patients with stage I-III breast cancer (54 TNBC, 12 HR+/HER2−) were enrolled. The median follow-up was 32 months. Safety end point was met. Incidence of grade ≥3 toxicities was 41%. The pCR rate was 59.2%, 33.3%, and 54.5% for the TNBC, HR+/HER2−, and entire cohort, respectively. A total of 77.8% of TNBC and 41.6% of HR+/HER2− had a near pCR (RCB 0–1). The 3-year EFS was 80%. In the entire cohort, PD-L1 expression increased after anti-PD1 (median Combined Positive Score [CPS], 7.49–23.20; 95% CI, −41.88 to −6.30; P = .044) and anti-PD1/RT (median CPS, 7.49–23.41; 95% CI, −41.88 to −6.30; P = .009), compared with baseline. In TNBC, adding RT to anti-PD1 significantly decreased TILs (28.9%–17.1%; 95% CI, 2.46 to 21.09; P = .014). Baseline TILs correlated with PD-L1 expression and TNF-a.Conclusion:Preoperative RT with pembrolizumab is safe and results in high pCR rates and 3-year EFS, despite the lack of pembrolizumab during NAC. PD-L1 and TILs may be predictive biomarkers for preoperative anti-PD1/RT response. Reduction in TILs after adding RT to anti-PD1 highlights the importance of treatment sequencing.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03366844.","PurposeThe benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors’ (ICIs) combination therapy in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remained unclear. We performed a meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of ICIs’ combination therapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC.MethodsA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ICIs’ combination therapy as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC was conducted via searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database. The data for efficacy and safety of ICIs’ combination therapy were subject to meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with different PD-L1 expression status.ResultsA total of 5 RCTs and 3163 patients were included. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) benefit with ICIs’ combination therapy was 0.68 (95% CI 0.62–0.75) compared with chemotherapy alone. The HR for progression-free survival (PFS) benefit and the odds ratio (OR) for overall response rate (ORR) increase were 0.62 (95% CI 0.56–0.68) and 2.01 (95% CI 1.70–2.38), respectively. The OS and PFS benefits with ICIs’ combination therapy over chemotherapy alone were also observed in the subgroup of PD-L1 positive expression, but not in the subgroup of PD-L1 negative expression. The incidence of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events was 60.4% with ICIs’ combination therapy and 56.3% with chemotherapy alone (OR, 1.19; 95% CI 0.90–1.57).ConclusionICIs’ combination therapy showed superior OS, PFS, and ORR over chemotherapy alone with a manageable safety profile. These results suggested that ICIs’ combination therapy can be considered as a new first-line treatment for advanced ESCC.",0
"Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) refers to a broad spectrum of conditions associating fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis) with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and potentially cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). The first stages of these diseases are reversible and the immune system, together with metabolic factors (obesity, insulin resistance, Western diet, etc.), can influence the disease trajectory leading to progression or regression. Dendritic cells are professional antigen‐presenting cells that constantly sense environmental stimuli and orchestrate immune responses. Herein, we discuss the existing literature on the heterogeneity of dendritic cell lineages, states, and functions, to provide a comprehensive overview of how liver dendritic cells influence the onset and evolution of MASLD.","ABSTRACTOver the past years, gene therapeutics have held great promise for treating many inherited and acquired diseases. The increasing number of approved gene therapeutics and developing clinical pipelines demonstrate the potential to treat diseases by modifying their genetic blueprints in vivo. Compared with conventional treatments targeting proteins rather than underlying causes, gene therapeutics can achieve enduring or curative effects via gene activation, inhibition, and editing. However, the delivery of DNA/RNA to the target cell to alter the gene expression is a complex process that involves, crossing numerous barriers in both the extracellular and intracellular environment. Generally, the delivery strategies can be divided into viral-based and non-viral-based vectors. This review summarizes various bioanalysis strategies that support the non-virus-based gene therapeutics research, including pharmacokinetics (PK)/toxicokinetics (TK), biodistribution, immunogenicity evaluations for the gene cargo, vector, and possible expressed protein, and highlights the challenges and future perspectives of bioanalysis strategies in non-virus-based gene therapeutics. This review may provide new insights and directions for the development of emerging bioanalytical methods, offering technical support and a research foundation for innovative gene therapy treatments.",0
"AbstractThe advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented potential for the targeted manipulation of DNA sequences. Advances in the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas9 system allowed potential applicability for the treatment of genetic diseases. CRISPR-Cas9’s mechanism of action involves the use of an RNA guide molecule to target-specific DNA sequences and the Cas9 enzyme to induce precise DNA cleavage. In the context of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, this review covers nonviral delivery methods for gene editing based on peptide internalization. Here, we describe critical areas of discussion such as immunogenicity, emphasizing the importance of safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the context of treating single-mutation genetic diseases using advanced editing techniques genetics as prime editor and base editor. The text discusses the versatility of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) in forming complexes for delivering biomolecules, particularly ribonucleoprotein for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells. In addition, it emphasizes the promise of combining CPPs with DNA base editing and prime editing systems. These systems, known for their simplicity and precision, hold great potential for correcting point mutations in human genetic diseases. In summary, the text provides a clear overview of the advantages of using CPPs for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9, particularly in conjunction with advanced editing systems, highlighting their potential impact on clinical applications in the treatment of single-mutation genetic diseases.","Immune checkpoint blockade has been used to treat breast cancer, but the clinical responses remain relatively poor. We have used the CRISPR-Cas9 kinome knockout library consisting of 763 kinase genes to identify tumor-intrinsic kinases conferring resistance to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. We have identified the CDC42BPB kinase as a potential target to overcome the resistance to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. We found that CDC42BPB is highly expressed in breast cancer patients who are non-responsive to immunotherapy. Furthermore, a small-molecule pharmacological inhibitor, BDP5290, which targets CDC42BPB, synergized with anti-PD-1 and enhanced tumor cell killing by promoting T cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Moreover, anti-PD-1-resistant breast cancer cells showed higher expression of CDC42BPB, and its inhibition rendered the resistant cells more susceptible to T cell killing in the presence of anti-PD-1. We also found that CDC42BPB phosphorylated AURKA, which in turn upregulated PD-L1 through cMYC. Our results have revealed a robust link between tumor-intrinsic kinase and immunotherapy resistance and have provided a rationale for a unique combination therapy of CDC42BPB inhibition and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for breast cancer.",1
"ABSTRACTTreatment of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) has evolved over the last decade. According to studies, the use of targeted therapies has significantly increased the life expectancy of patients. Moreover, ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have improved clinical outcomes. In Lebanon, translating recommendations into clinical practice remains challenging. A Lebanese expert panel of oncologists was convened to describe the management paradigm and the clinical evidence supporting the optimal use of next-generation TKIs in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC and to provide an expert overview of local challenges and recommendations for optimizing the management of advanced NSCLC in Lebanese patients. The experts agreed that these recommendations should be part of a healthcare strategy to be implemented at the national level.","Aim: This cohort study evaluated the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and mortality as well as ICI discontinuation among older adults with NSCLC.Methods: 2007–2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database was used and survival analysis with time-varying exposure of irAEs was applied to estimate the associations.Results & conclusion: A total of 8,175 individuals were included, with 46.8% of whom developed an irAE. Cox regression models showed the occurrence of any irAEs was associated with increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.63–1.82) and treatment discontinuation (HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.78–1.97). Some variability was observed in the effect on the two outcomes depending on the type of irAE.",1
"PurposeAging is closely related to the occurrence of many diseases, including cancer, and involves changes in the immune microenvironment. γδT cells are important components of resident lymphocytes in mucosal tissues. However, little is known about the effects that the aged lung has on γδT cells and their prognostic significance in non-small cell lung cancer.MethodsIn the current study, the expression of γδTCR and IL-17A was measured by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 168 patients with adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 144 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Furthermore, gene transcription patterns in LUAD and LUSC tumors and normal controls were extracted from TCGA and GTEx databases and were analyzed.ResultsHigh frequency of γδT cells was observed in patients with LUAD and LUSC, whereas the levels of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD56 + cells were decreased. Elevated γδT cells in tumors were mainly IL-17A-releasing γδT17 cells, which were found to be enriched in aged patients. High γδT cell levels positively corelated with the overall survival (OS) of patients, especially the 5-year OS in the elderly. Further analysis of gene transcription patterns indicated that increased expression of LTBR, HES1, RORC, CCR6, IL1, and IL23A may contribute to the transformation of the tumor microenvironment in a manner conducive to γδT17 cell development and differentiation. Finally, gene analysis between different age groups revealed that the expression of CCR6 and IL7 in LUAD, as well as Hes1, IL7, and IL23A in LUSC, were remarkably higher in elderly (age ≥ 60 years) than in younger individuals (age < 60 years).ConclusionOur findings suggest that intrinsic alterations in the aging lung lead to γδT17 cell enrichment, which subsequently may exert anti-tumor effects in the elderly.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03742-z.","BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"Despite the notable efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, resistance in most individuals necessitates additional investigation. For this study, we collected tumor tissues from nine HCC patients receiving anti-PD1 monotherapy and conducted RNA sequencing. These findings revealed significant upregulation of GSDME, which is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in anti-PD1-resistant patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated levels of GSDME+ macrophages in HCC tissues presented a poorer prognosis. The analysis of single-cell sequencing data and flow cytometry revealed that the suppression of GSDME expression in nontumor cells resulted in a decrease in the proportion of M2-like macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TIME) of HCC while concurrently augmenting the cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells. The non-N-terminal fragment of GSDME within macrophages combines with PDPK1, thereby activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and facilitating M2-like polarization. The small-molecule Eliprodil inhibited the increase in PDPK1 phosphorylation mediated by GSDME site 1. The combination of Eliprodil and anti-PD1 was effective in the treatment of both spontaneous HCC in c-Myc + /+;Alb-Cre + /+ mice and in a hydrodynamic tail vein injection model, which provides a promising strategy for novel combined immunotherapy.","BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is characterized by abnormally fibrotic mesenchyme, which notably influences on the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Low-dose arsenic trioxide (ATO, 1.0 μM) can inhibit the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and affect fibrosis, which is a potential strategy for enhancing the sensitivity to immunotherapy.MethodsExtracellular matrix (ECM) models were employed to assess the regulatory effects of ATO on ECM and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Orthotopic C57BL/6J models were utilized to evaluate the influence of ATO on CD8+T cell infiltration and immunotherapy in PC. Additionally, nanomaterials loaded with ATO designed to specifically target PSCs (scAbFAP-α-HMSNs-PAA-ATO) were produced to enhance targeting effects of ATO.ResultsLow-dose ATO (1.0 μM) suppressed PSCs activation, exhibiting potential for synergistic immunotherapy. Under low-dose ATO intervention, ECM underwent remodeling, leading to increases in CD8+T cell infiltration, thereby enhancing anti-PD-L1 therapy effect. We further demonstrated that low-dose ATO remodeled ECM by regulating the expression of LOXL3 in PSCs. scAbFAP-α-HMSNs-PAA-ATO exhibited improved targeting capabilities, and enhanced capacity to inhibit fibrosis and sensitize immunotherapy.ConclusionsOur research reveals that low-dose ATO, by regulating LOXL3, remodels the ECM and enhances CD8+T cell infiltration, thus sensitizing the efficacy of immunotherapy, which provides a novel strategy for comprehensive treatment to PC.",1
"Primary melanoma of the oral cavity is extremely rare, accounting for 0.2–8% of all melanomas. Lesions arising from mucosal melanocytes occur most frequently on the gingiva or palate. Mucosal melanomas carry a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanomas. Very few studies have been published due to rarity of disease. 46 year old lady presented with black colored lesion over left side of her tongue for 6 weeks. On examination there was 3 × 2.5 cm black colored patch over left lateral part of tongue in middle 1/3rd, not crossing midline. Tip and base of tongue were free. Biopsy was suggestive of malignant melanoma of tongue. Patient underwent surgery (wide local excision of left lateral border of tongue lesion + left selective neck dissection). Final Histopathological report revealed malignant melanoma of tongue with all margins free, Depth of invasion 3 mm, Lympho-vascular invasion present, and no perineural invasion, left level III cervical lymph node metastases. Patient thus received adjuvant RT. Immunotherapy was also advised in multidisciplinary clinic, but patient was non-compliant. Early diagnosis will be promoted by careful oral examination and early biopsy of pigmented and non-pigmented masses. Early diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis of patients with oral malignant melanoma.","Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine whether MRI radiomic features of key cerebral structures differ between women and men, and whether detection of such differences depends on the image resolution.Materials and Methods:Ultrahigh resolution (UHR) 3D MP2RAGE (magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo) T1-weighted MR images (voxel size, 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm3) of the brain of 30 subjects (18 women and 12 men; mean age, 39.0 ± 14.8 years) without abnormal findings on MRI were retrospectively included. MRI was performed on a whole-body 7 T MR system. A convolutional neural network was used to segment the following structures: frontal cortex, frontal white matter, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and corpus callosum. Eighty-seven radiomic features were extracted respectively: gray-level histogram (n = 18), co-occurrence matrix (n = 24), run-length matrix (n = 16), size-zone matrix (n = 16), and dependence matrix (n = 13). Feature extraction was performed at UHR and, additionally, also after resampling to 1.4 × 1.4 × 1.4 mm3 voxel size (standard clinical resolution). Principal components (PCs) of radiomic features were calculated, and independent samples t tests with Cohen d as effect size measure were used to assess differences in PCs between women and men for the different cerebral structures.Results:At UHR, at least a single PC differed significantly between women and men in 6/7 cerebral structures: frontal cortex (d = −0.79, P = 0.042 and d = −1.01, P = 0.010), frontal white matter (d = −0.81, P = 0.039), thalamus (d = 1.43, P < 0.001), globus pallidus (d = 0.92, P = 0.020), caudate nucleus (d = −0.83, P = 0.039), and corpus callosum (d = −0.97, P = 0.039). At standard clinical resolution, only a single PC extracted from the corpus callosum differed between sexes (d = 1.05, P = 0.009).Conclusions:Nonnegligible differences in radiomic features of several key structures of the brain exist between women and men, and need to be accounted for. Very high spatial resolution may be required to uncover and further investigate the sexual dimorphism of brain structures on MRI.",0
"Frizzled receptors (FZDs) are key contributors intrinsic to the Wnt signaling pathway, activation of FZDs triggering the Wnt signaling cascade is frequently observed in human tumors and intimately associated with an aggressive carcinoma phenotype. It has been shown that the abnormal expression of FZD receptors contributes to the manifestation of malignant characteristics in human tumors such as enhanced cell proliferation, metastasis, chemotherapy resistance as well as the acquisition of cancer stemness. Given the essential roles of FZD receptors in the Wnt signaling in human tumors, this review aims to consolidate the prevailing knowledge on the specific status of FZD receptors (FZD1–10) and elucidate their respective functions in tumor progression. Furthermore, we delineate the structural basis for binding of FZD and its co-receptors to Wnt, and provide a better theoretical foundation for subsequent studies on related mechanisms. Finally, we describe the existing biological classes of small molecule-based FZD inhibitors in detail in the hope that they can provide useful assistance for design and development of novel drug candidates targeted FZDs.","Introduction/ObjectiveThe spread of tumors (48% in men and 51% in women), as well as the protection of malignant tumors by stromal cells and complex blood vessels, pose significant challenges to drug delivery to tumors. Modern chemotherapy, on the other hand, addresses tumor growth suppression by at least 60% through versatile formulation systems and numerous modifications to drug delivery systems. The renewable and naturally occurring polymers present invariably in all living cells form the fundamental foundation for most anticancer drug development. The review aims to discuss in detail the preparations of polysaccharide, lipid, and protein-based drug-loading vehicles for the targeted delivery of prominent anticancer drugs. It also provides an explanation of drug distribution in blood (cumulative releases of nearly 80% drug) and drug accumulation at tumor sites (1–5 mg/kg) due to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR).MethodsSpecific delivery examples for treating colorectal and breast carcinomas have been presented to distinguish the varied drug administration, bioavailability, and tumor internalization mechanisms between sugar, fatty acid, and amino acid polymers. Current therapy possibilities based on cutting-edge literature are provided, along with drug delivery systems tailored to tumor location and invasive properties.ResultsThe unique combinations of the three natural polymers provide unparalleled solutions to minimize the toxicity (<20% drug release) of the chemotherapeutic drugs on normal tissues. Moreover, the development of a consolidated drug delivery system has contributed to a substantial reduction (dose reduction from 10.43 µM to 1.9 µM) in the undesirable consequences of higher dosages of chemotherapeutic drugs.ConclusionThe review extensively covers safe chemotherapeutic systems with significant advantages (tumor volume shrinkage of 4T1 cells from 1000 mm3 to 200 mm3) in clinical applications of carcinoma treatments using natural polymers.",0
"BackgroundDoxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) has been regarded as the standard treatment regimen for classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In recent years, ABVD-like regimens, which emerged due to shortages and the lung toxicity of bleomycin or the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors and antibody–drug conjugates, may be favorable, but have not yet been tested.MethodsWe compared the outcomes of ABVD with ABVD-like regimens, which include bleomycin was completely or partially omitted; meanwhile, etoposide or PD-1 inhibitors were added.Results5-Year progression-free survival (PFS) was higher for ABVD than ABVD-like regimens in young patients (82.1% vs. 67.0%, p = 0.029), patients with serum beta-2 microglobulin (β2-MG) ≥ 1.85 mg/L (75.8% vs. 57.6%, p = 0.046), and advanced-stage patients with IPS score 4–7(63.1%, 18.3%, p = 0.038). For elderly (60.5% vs.76.1%, p = 0.089), patients with β2-MG < 1.85 mg/L (83.1% vs 76.1%, p = 0.282), and advanced-stage patients with IPS score 0–3(84.6% vs. 81.3%, p = 0.476), 5-year PFS for ABVD did not differ from ABVD-like regimens. Elderly patients treated with bleomycin-free regimens showed a better survival trend compared with ABVD (99.3% vs. 61.3%, p = 0.270).ConclusionABVD is superior to ABVD-like regimens in achieving PFS in young patients or patients with poor prognosis including high IPS score and β2-MG level. ABVD-like regimens are as effective as ABVD in elderly or low-risk patients including low IPS score and β2-MG level; elderly patients treated with bleomycin-free regimens exhibit a better survival trend compared with ABVD.","BackgroundThe regulatory mechanisms guiding CD4 T cell differentiation are complex and are further influenced by intrinsic cell variability along with that of microenvironmental cues, such as cytokine and nutrient availability.ObjectiveThis study aims to expand our understanding of CD4 T cell differentiation by examining the influence of intrinsic noise on cell fate.MethodologyA model based on a complex regulatory network of early signaling events involved in CD4 T cell activation and differentiation was described in terms of a set of stochastic differential equation to assess the effect of noise intensity on differentiation efficiency to the Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, and TFH effector phenotypes under defined cytokine and nutrient conditions.ResultsThe increase of noise intensity decreases differentiation efficiencies. In a microenvironment of Th1-inducing cytokines and optimal nutrient conditions, noise levels of 3 % , 5 % and 10 % render Th1 differentiation efficiencies of 0.87, 0.76 and 0.62, respectively, underscoring the sensitivity of the network to random variations. Further increments of noise reveal that the network is relatively stable until noise levels of 20 % , where the resulting cell phenotypes becomes heterogeneous. Notably, Treg differentiation showed the highest robustness to noise perturbations. A combined Th1-Th2 cytokine environment with optimal nutrient levels induces a dominant Th1 phenotype; however, removal of glutamine shifts the balance towards the Th2 phenotype at all noise levels, with an efficiency similar to that obtained under Th2-only cytokine conditions. Similarly, combinations of Th1/Treg and Treg/Th17-inducing cytokines along with the removal of either tryptophan or oxygen shift the dominant Th1 and Treg phenotypes towards Treg and Th17 respectively. Model results are consistent with differentiation efficiency patterns obtained under well-controlled experimental settings reported in the literature.ConclusionThe stochastic CD4 T cell mathematical model presented here demonstrates a noise-dependent modulation of T cell differentiation induced by cytokines and nutrient availability. Modeling results can be explained by the network topology, which assures that the system will arrive at stable states of cell functionality despite variable levels of biological intrinsic noise. Moreover, the model provides insights into the robustness of the T cell differentiation process.",0
"One in six deaths worldwide is caused by cancer, making it a major global health concern. Despite their effectiveness, traditional treatment approaches such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery frequently have negative side effects and high costs. New approaches, such as gene therapy, are promising but are hampered by high costs and accessibility problems. Nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate targeted drug delivery by leveraging passive targeting mechanisms, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and by actively targeting surfaces with ligands for site-specific binding through the functionalization of surfaces. This approach enhances therapeutic results while lowering off-target toxicities. Notably, chemotherapeutic medications, immunotherapeutic agents, and photothermal therapies can now be delivered more precisely to the affected site using NP-based systems. By boosting particularity, reducing side effects, and tackling drug resistance, nanomedicine has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and ultimately advance personalized oncological care. These advancements highlight the possibilities for field growth, and future development regulations are detailed.","PurposeProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression may influence the prognosis of patients with localized esophageal cancer. The current study compared the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression between tumor cells and immune cells.MethodsArchival esophageal tumor tissue samples were collected from patients who received paclitaxel and cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in three prospective phase II trials. PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells was examined immunohistochemically by using the SP142 antibody and scored by two independent pathologists. The association of PD-L1 expression with patient’s outcomes was analyzed using a log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis.ResultsA total of 100 patients were included. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was positive (≥ 1%, TC-positive) in 55 patients; PD-L1 expression on immune cells was high (≥ 5%, IC-high) in 30 patients. TC-positive status was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.63, P = 0.035), whereas IC-high status was associated with improved OS (HR: 0.44, P = 0.0024). Multivariate analysis revealed that TC-positive, IC-high, and performance status were independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival and that IC-high and performance status were independent factors for OS. Furthermore, the combination of IC-high and TC-negative status was associated with the optimal OS, whereas that of TC-positive and IC-low status was associated with the worst OS.ConclusionPD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells may have different prognostic value for patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving neoadjuvant CRT. A combination of these two indexes may further improve the prognostic prediction.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03772-7.",0
"IntroductionThe aim of this study was to investigate the role of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis and to develop a nomogram for predicting HCC prognosis.Method In this study, 1066 HCC patients were enrolled between August 2018 and April 2022. TK1 levels were measured within one week before enrollment, and the relationship with HCC prognosis was evaluated. Next, all patients were randomly assigned to the training set (70%, n = 746) and the validation set (30%, n = 320). We used multivariate Cox analysis to find independent prognostic factors in the training set to construct a nomogram. The predictive power of the nomogram was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The optimal critical value of TK1 was determined as 2.35 U/L using X-tile software.ResultBefore and after propensity score matching (PSM), the median overall survival (mOS) of the low-TK1 group (< 2.35 U/L) remained significantly longer than that of the high-TK1 group (≥ 2.35 U/L) (48.1 vs 16.5 months, p < 0.001; 75.7 vs 19.8 months, p = 0.001). Moreover, multivariate Cox analysis showed that the low TK1 level was an independent positive prognostic indicator. Additionally, the area under the ROC curve for predicting the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates was 0.770, 0.758, and 0.805, respectively.ConclusionsTK1 could serve as a prognostic marker for HCC. In addition, the nomogram showed good predictive capability for HCC prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05089-z.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody are promising treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but lack reliable biomarkers of response. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between pre-treatment body composition measures (muscle, adipose, etc.) and the prognosis of patients with HCC treated with ICIs.MethodsWe measured the total area of all skeletal muscles, total adipose tissue area, subcutaneous adipose tissue area, and visceral adipose tissue area at the level of the third lumbar vertebra using quantitative CT. Then, we calculated the skeletal muscle index, visceral adipose tissue index, subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI), and total adipose tissue index. The Cox regression model was used to determine the independent factors of the patient prognosis and construct a nomogram to predict survival. The consistency index (C-index) and calibration curve were used to determine the predictive accuracy and discrimination ability of the nomogram.ResultsMultivariate analysis revealed that the SATI (high- vs. low SATI; HR 0.251; 95% CI 0.109–0.577; P = 0.001), sarcopenia (sarcopenia vs. no sarcopenia; HR 2.171; 95% CI 1.100–4.284; P = 0.026), and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) (PVTT vs. No PVTT; HR 2.429; 95% CI 1. 197–4. 929; P = 0.014) were indicated as independent prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis indicated that Child–Pugh class (HR 0.477, 95% CI 0.257–0.885, P = 0.019) and sarcopenia (HR 2.376, 95% CI 1.335–4.230, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors of PFS. We established a nomogram using SATI, SA, and PVTT to predict the 12-month and 18-month survival probability of HCC patients treated with ICIs. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.754 (95% CI 0.686–0.823), and the calibration curve confirmed that the predicted results were in good agreement with the actual observations.ConclusionSubcutaneous adipose and sarcopenia are significant prognostic factors of patients with HCC receiving ICIs. A nomogram based on body composition parameters and clinical factors could well predict survival in HCC patients treated with ICIs.",1
"ObjectiveCervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is one of the most relevant influencing factors for the oncological outcome of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Several studies showed that the tumors depth of invasion (DOI) influences the risk for CLNM, however varying across the oral subsites. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of DOI and other risk factors in OSCC of the tongue in relation to the occurrence of occult CLNM.Materials and methodsIn this retrospective study, n = 139 patients with primary OSCC of the tongue, treated by complete surgical resection (R0) with curative intention between 2013 and 2021, were included. For data analysis, epidemiologic data as well as preoperative tumor staging, surgical therapy including neck management, histopathological tumor data and follow-up were considered. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine association between histopathological risk factors and the occurrence of occult CLNM.ResultsThe rate of occult cervical metastasis was 19.4%. T-staging, cervical nodal disease (pN+) and lymphatic invasion were significantly associated with reduced OS and RFS. While DOI had no relevant influence on the OS and RFS (p = 0.88 and p = 0.91 respectively), there was significant correlation between DOI and the occurrence of occult CLNM (OR: 1.17, 95%CI: 1.05–1.30; p < 0.01). The optimal cutoff in predicting occult CLNM was 6 mm (Sensitivity: 84.2%, Specificity: 73.5%, AUC: 0.75).ConclusionsThe DOI is a helpful risk parameter to predict the occurrence of occult nodal disease in OSCC of the tongue. Given the critical decision cutoff between 2 and 4 mm DOI for performing elective neck dissection in the current guidelines, our data suggests that in these cases, surgical de-escalation could be feasible with close follow-up.Clinical relevanceThis study highlights the relevance of DOI as a risk parameter in the prediction of CLNM with the aim to specify the individual patient risk and to deescalate surgical therapy in order to decrease comorbidities while improving the oncological prognosis.","PurposeThe current evaluation methods for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly CD8 + TILs, mainly rely on semiquantitative immunohistochemistry with high variability. We aimed to construct an individualized DNA methylation-based signature for CD8 + TILs (CD8 + MeTIL) that may characterize melanoma immune microenvironment and guide therapeutic selection.MethodsThe transcriptome profiles and DNA methylation data of 457 melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed. Differential methylation analysis between groups with high and low CD8 + TILs was performed to select differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and define CD8 + MeTIL. The prognostic value of CD8 + MeTIL and its predictive value for immunotherapy response were investigated using multiple melanoma cohorts.ResultsWe successfully constructed the CD8 + MeTIL signature based on four DMPs. The survival analyses showed that higher CD8 + MeTIL score was associated with worse survival outcomes in TCGA-SKCM and GSE144487 cohorts. The ROC curve for the predictive analysis revealed that the survival prediction of CD8 + MeTIL score was superior compared with CD8 + TILs (CIBERSORT) and CD8B mRNA expression. Furthermore, we founded that tumors with higher CD8 + MeTIL score were marked with immunosuppressive characteristics, including low immune score and downregulated immune-related pathways. More importantly, the CD8 + MeTIL score showed a potential predictive value for the benefit from immunotherapy in two published cohorts. When combined CD8 + MeTIL with PD-L1 expression, the patient classification showed significantly different immunotherapy response rates and long-term survival outcomes.ConclusionsThe CD8 + MeTIL signature might be as a novel method to evaluate CD8 + TILs and guide immunotherapy approaches.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04566-1.",1
"Background and aimDanggui Buxue Decoction (DBD) has been applied to alleviate chronic heart failure (CHF) in clinics, however, its mechanism is still unclear. This study investigates the potential action mechanism of DBD for rats with CHF combined with liver injury.Experimental procedureFor this purpose, this study established a CHF rat model. The change of proteins in myocardial tissues was identified by proteomics and then further verified using western blotting. Additionally, metabolomics revealed the metabolic pathways associated with liver injury in CHF rats.Results and conclusionAnimal studies demonstrated that DBD could relieve CHF as it significantly reduced serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in CHF rats, and promoted the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), cytochrome oxidase (COX), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in myocardial tissues. Myocardial proteomics analysis revealed that DBD improved myocardial mitochondria and peroxisomes function by regulating the expression of proteins associated with energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Western blotting confirmed that DBD upregulated the expression of proteins in the adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 α)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPAR β) signaling pathway, which also proved the efficacy of DBD in alleviating CHF in rats. Hepatic metabolomics analysis showed that DBD could restore the damaged liver function of CHF rats via metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of lipid, vitamin, and amino acids. In conclusion, this study unveiled a novel action mechanism of DBD in the treating ISO-induced CHF and liver injury based on proteomics and metabolomics. These results lay a scientific basis for the widespread application of DBD in the cardiovascular field.","Background and aimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The mechanisms driving the transition from hepatitis to cirrhosis, and eventually, to HCC are unclear. This study aimed to clarify the metabolic changes that underly the progression of HCC and identify potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers.MethodsThis prospective study collected serum samples from patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC, hospitalized at the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, from December 2022 to December 2023. The samples were analyzed using non-targeted, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis modeling and t-tests were used to identify key differentially expressed metabolites associated with the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the key metabolic pathways involved, while machine learning models were applied to identify the metabolite signatures.ResultsWe identified 153 differentially expressed metabolites in the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC, many of which were involved in ammonia cycling or the metabolism of methylhistidine, alanine, arginine, proline, or betaine. We also identified L-histidine and adenosine as the metabolites that demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing among the hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC stages.ConclusionsOur study comprehensively characterized the metabolic profiles of the different stages of the hepatitis-cirrhosis-HCC transition. We showed that serum metabolite detection is a viable diagnostic tool for identifying and monitoring high-risk individuals, which could potentially be used to halt the development of HCC.",1
"ABSTRACTAn established view in genetic engineering dictates an increase in the discovery of therapeutic peptides to enable the treatment of multiple diseases. The use of hypodermic needle for delivery of proteins and peptides occurs due to the hydrophilic nature, sensitivity toward proteolytic enzymes and high molecular weight. The non-invasive nature of the transdermal delivery technique offers multiple advantages over the invasive route to release drugs directly into the systemic circulation to enhance bioavailability, better patient compliance, reduced toxicity and local irritability. The transdermal route seems highly desirable from the pharmaco-therapeutic and patient compliance point of view, however, the lipophilic barrier of skin restricts the application. The use of several techniques like electrical methods (iontophoresis, sonophoresis etc.), chemical penetration enhancers (for example protease inhibitors, penetration enhancers, etc.) and nanocarriers (dendrimers, lipid nanocapsules, etc.) are utilized to improve the passage of drug molecules across the biomembranes. Additionally, such clinical interventions facilitate the physicochemical characteristics of peptides, to enable effective preservation, conveyance and release of therapeutic agents. Moreover, strategies ensure the attainment of the intended targets and enhance treatment outcomes for multiple diseases. This review article focuses on the techniques of peptide transportation across the skin to advance the delivery approaches and therapeutic efficiency.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a tropical disease that can be fatal if acute and untreated. Diagnosis is difficult, the treatment is toxic and prophylactic vaccines do not exist. Leishmania parasites express hundreds of proteins and several of them are relevant for the host's immune system. In this context, in the present study, 10 specific T-cell epitopes from 5 parasite proteins, which were identified by antibodies in VL patients’ sera, were selected and used to construct a gene codifying the new chimeric protein called rCHI. The rCHI vaccine was developed and thoroughly evaluated for its potential effectiveness against Leishmania infantum infection. We used monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and polymeric micelles (Mic) as adjuvant and/or delivery system. The results demonstrated that both rCHI/MPLA and rCHI/Mic significantly stimulate an antileishmanial Th1-type cellular response, with higher production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12 and nitrite in vaccinated animals, and this response was sustained after challenge. In addition, these mice significantly reduced the parasitism in internal organs and increased the production of IgG2a isotype antibodies. In vivo and in vitro toxicity showed that rCHI is safe for the mammalians, and the recombinant protein also induced in vitro lymphoproliferative response and production of Th1-type cytokines by human cells, which were collected from healthy subjects and treated VL patients. These data suggest rCHI plus MPLA or micelles could be considered as a vaccine candidate against VL.",0
"Hematological cancers, such as lymphomas and leukemias, pose significant challenges in oncology, necessitating a deeper understanding of their molecular landscape to enhance therapeutic strategies. This article critically examines and discusses recent research on the roles of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in myeloma, lymphomas, and leukemias with a particular focus on pediatric acute lymphoblastic (lymphocytic) leukemia (ALL). By utilizing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we analyzed GPCR expression patterns in pediatric ALL samples (aged 3–12 years old), with a further focus on Class A orphan GPCRs. Our analysis revealed distinct GPCR expression profiles in pediatric ALL, identifying several candidates with aberrant upregulated expression compared with healthy counterparts. Among these GPCRs, GPR85, GPR65, and GPR183 have varying numbers of studies in the field of hematological cancers and pediatric ALL. Furthermore, we explored missense mutations of pediatric ALL in relation to the RNA gene expression findings, providing insights into the genetic underpinnings of this disease. By integrating both RNA-seq and missense mutation data, this article aims to provide an insightful and broader perspective on the potential correlations between specific GPCR and their roles in pediatric ALL.","Objective:There are significant disparities in outcomes among Hispanic patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recent studies have demonstrated favorable outcomes of pegaspargase-containing ALL regimens (PEG-CAR) in young adults however, outcomes in Hispanic ethnicity continue to be underreported.Methods:We evaluated outcomes of newly diagnosed, adult B-cell ALL Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients consecutively treated with a PEG-CAR or HyperCVAD between January 2011 and November 2022. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) while secondary endpoints included cumulative incidence of relapse and overall survival (OS).Results:Among 105 included patients, 48 (45.7%) were treated with a PEG-CAR and 57 (54.3%) with HyperCVAD. Median age was 38 years (range, 18–75 years), 61% were Hispanic, and 35.2% had poor-genetic risk. Hispanic patients demonstrated significantly worse 5-year EFS with a PEG-CAR compared to that seen with HyperCVAD (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.32–5.04; p = .006) whereas non-Hispanic patients had better outcomes with PIR (52.4% vs. 42.0%). Hispanic ethnicity (p = .015) and male sex (p = .019) were independent predictors for poor OS.Conclusions:Hispanic patients with B-cell ALL had worse EFS with a PEG-CAR as compared with HyperCVAD. Future studies will aim to confirm these findings and establish a tailored treatment approach for this high-risk population.",1
"P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) is an adenosine-activated G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a central role in platelet function, hemostasis, and thrombosis. P2Y12R activation can promote platelet aggregation and adhesion to cancer cells, promote tumor angiogenesis, and affect the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumor drug resistance, which is conducive to the progression of cancers. Meanwhile, P2Y12R inhibitors can inhibit this effect, suggesting that P2Y12R may be a potential therapeutic target for cancer. P2Y12R is involved in cancer development and metastasis, while P2Y12R inhibitors are effective in inhibiting cancer. However, a new study suggests that long-term use of P2Y12R inhibitors may increase the risk of cancer and the mechanism remains to be explored. In this paper, we reviewed the structural and functional characteristics of P2Y12R and its role in cancer. We explored the role of P2Y12R inhibitors in different tumors and the latest advances by summarizing the basic and clinical studies on the effects of P2Y12R inhibitors on tumors.","BackgroundPreviously, albendazole (ABZ) has been reported as an anti-parasitic drug rather than anti-tumor drug. Our study aim to investigate whether ABZ also has a potential anti-tumor effect by shaping the tumor immune microenvironment and interrogate whether ABZ could synergize with the PD-L1 blockade.MethodsC57BL/6 mice (C57) were intravenously injected with B16F10-luciferase (B16-luc) cells to establish a lung metastatic melanoma model and subcutaneously inoculated with B16-luc cells to establish a subcutaneous tumor model. The tumor volume and tumor metastasis loci of the mice were measured by a vernier caliper and in vivo imaging. RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the different genes and pathways of immune cells in the tumors. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the different subsets of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.ResultsThe results suggested that ABZ significantly inhibited lung melanoma metastasis with decreased fluorescence intensity and nodule score and mediated the regression of subcutaneous melanoma in mice with decreased tumor volume. Moreover, RNA sequencing results showed that ABZ regulated the gene expression levels and pathways of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Meanwhile, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence showed that the number and percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells were enhanced in tumors after ABZ treatment. Furthermore, the combination of ABZ and anti-PD-L1 treatment significantly potentiated anti-tumor efficacy in both lung metastasis and subcutaneous melanoma models and mediated an increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells as compared to the control group.ConclusionABZ inhibits melanoma growth and metastasis. Moreover, ABZ synergized with PD-L1 blockade mediates tumor regression.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05415-5.",1
"ObjectiveSMARCD1 is a part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex family, which consists of transcription factors that are implicated in various types of cancer. Examining SMARCD1 expression in human cancers can provide valuable insights into the development and progression of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM).MethodsOur study comprehensively examined the association between SMARCD1 expression and numerous factors, including prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME), immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) in SKCM. Then we utilized immunohistochemical staining to measure the SMARCD1 expression in both SKCM tissues and normal skin tissues. Furthermore, we conducted in vitro experimentation to evaluate the effects of SMARCD1 knockdown on SKCM cells.ResultsWe found that aberrant expression of SMARCD1 across 16 cancers was strongly correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In addition, our research revealed that SMARCD1 expression is associated with multiple factors in different types of cancer, including immune infiltration, TME, immune-related genes, MSI, TMB, and sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. SMARCD1 is likely involved in various SKCM signaling pathways and biological processes. Additionally, our research revealed that an SMARCD1-based risk factor model accurately predicted OS in SKCM patients. Furthermore, the downregulation of SMARCD1 expression demonstrated a significant inhibition of SKCM cell proliferation and migration, as well as an increase in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.ConclusionWe conclude that SMARCD1 is a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarker for SKCM, and its expression has significant clinical implications for the development of novel treatment strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05064-8.","PurposeSkin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a highly aggressive melanocytic carcinoma whose high heterogeneity and complex etiology make its prognosis difficult to predict. This study aimed to construct a risk subtype typing model for SKCM.MethodsThe study proposes a deep learning framework combining early fusion feature autoencoder (AE) and late fusion feature AE for risk subtype prediction of SKCM. The deep learning framework integrates mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation data of SKCM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and clusters the screened multi-omics features associated with survival prognosis to identify risk subtypes. Differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis were performed between risk subtypes, while SVM classifiers were constructed between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression screening and risk subtype labels inferred from multi-omics data, and the predictive robustness of risk subtypes inferred from the risk subtype classification prediction model was validated using two independent datasets.ResultsThe deep learning framework that combined early fusion feature AE with late fusion feature AE distinguished the two best risk subtypes compared to the multi-omics integration approach with single strategy AE or PCA. A promising C-index (C-index = 0.748) and a significant difference in survival (log-rank P value = 4.61 × 10–9) were found between the identified risk subtypes. The DEGs with the top significance values together with differentially expressed miRNAs provided the biological interpretation of risk subtypes on SKCM. Finally, the framework was applied to predict risk subtypes in two independent test datasets of SKCM patients, all of which showed good predictive power (C-index > 0.680) and significant survival differences (log-rank P value < 0.01).ConclusionThe SKCM risk subtypes identified by integrating multi-omics data based on deep learning can not only improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SKCM, but also provide clinicians with assistance in treatment decisions.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05358-x.",1
"BackgroundCheckpoint inhibitors (CKI) targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 are major therapies for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite numerous studies of biological biomarkers, we currently lack a marker to predict CKI primary resistance. The aim of this study was to isolate clinical markers associated with the absence of efficacy of CKI used as monotherapy in NSCLC.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 172 patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for advanced NSCLC at the Dijon Cancer Center. Baseline characteristics were compared using the Chi squared test between responders and non-responders. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test for univariate analysis. Cox regression models were used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).ResultsAmong 172 patients included, 149 (86.5%) received CKI after platinum chemotherapy. Response rate (RR) was 16%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 months (95% CI 0.7–30 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95% CI 0.7–46.8 months). By univariate analysis, WHO performance status ≥ 1, presence of bone, liver and pleuroperitoneal metastasis were associated with poor PFS and OS. Multivariate analysis showed that only pleuroperitoneal metastasis was independently associated with PFS and OS. Patients with pleuroperitoneal metastasis and WHO performance status ≥ 1 had a < 10% chance of yielding a benefit from CKI.ConclusionsOur data support the hypothesis that pleuroperitoneal metastasis is a major predictive factor affecting CKI efficacy in NSCLC patients and may be used to avoid CKI monotherapy for such patients.","BACKGROUND & AIMS:Single-agent anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors convey outstanding clinical benefits in a small fraction (w20%) of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) but the molecular mechanisms determining response are unknown. To fill this gap, we herein analyze the molecular and immune traits of aHCC in patients treated with anti-PD1.METHODS:Overall, 111 tumor samples from patients with aHCC were obtained from 13 centers before systemic therapies. We performed molecular analysis and immune deconvolution using whole-genome expression data (n = 83), mutational analysis (n = 72), and histologic evaluation with an endpoint of objective response.RESULTS:Among 83 patients with transcriptomic data, 28 were treated in frontline, whereas 55 patients were treated after tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) either in second or third line. Responders treated in frontline showed upregulated interferon-γ signaling and major histocompatibility complex II–related antigen presentation. We generated an 11-gene signature (IFNAP), capturing these molecular features, which predicts response and survival in patients treated with anti-PD1 in frontline. The signature was validated in a separate cohort of aHCC and >240 patients with other solid cancer types where it also predicted response and survival. Of note, the same signature was unable to predict response in archival tissue of patients treated with frontline TKIs, highlighting the need for fresh biopsies before immunotherapy.CONCLUSION:Interferon signaling and major histocompatibility complex–related genes are key molecular features of HCCs responding to anti-PD1. A novel 11-gene signature predicts response in frontline aHCC, but not in patients pretreated with TKIs. These results must be confirmed in prospective studies and highlights the need for biopsies before immunotherapy to identify biomarkers of response.",1
"AbstractObjectivesBreast sensation following autologous breast reconstruction impacts patients’ quality of life. Although spontaneous reinnervation in free flaps was documented by many authors, there are efforts to further improve restoration of breast sensation. Interestingly, animal studies indicated that trastuzumab has several beneficial effects on transected peripheral nerves. Our aim was to compare spontaneous sensory recovery after free TRAM flap breast reconstruction between patients who were and were not treated with trastuzumab.MethodsThe study included 14 subjects who underwent tactile sensation examination in 5-year period after noninnervated free muscle-sparing TRAM flap breast reconstruction at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. Small and large flap skin islands and contralateral healthy breasts were tested with Semmes-Weinstein type monofilaments. Three sensory scores were created to more accurately compare breast sensation.ResultsIn subjects receiving trastuzumab, sensory recovery earlier extended to at least four of five large skin island regions and was always present in the central flap area in comparison with subjects who were not administered trastuzumab (p=0.0476). As indicated by total sensory scores, trastuzumab-treated subjects restored sensation better resembling healthy control breasts (54 vs. 39 % in large skin islands; 95 vs. 71 % in small skin islands).ConclusionsTo the authors’ knowledge, the current study for the first time demonstrated trastuzumab’s potential to improve sensory outcomes in human. Our results support the strategy that accelerated nerve regeneration is a key to more successful reinnervation. HER2 and EGFR inhibitors emerge as new candidates for pharmacological interventions in peripheral nerve injury treatment.","SummaryBackgroundMycobacterium tuberculosis is the main causative agent of tuberculosis. BCG, the only licensed vaccine, provides inadequate protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. Controlled human infection models are useful tools for vaccine development. We aimed to determine a safe dose of aerosol-inhaled live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG as a surrogate for M tuberculosis infection, then compare the safety and tolerability of infection models established using aerosol-inhaled and intradermally administered BCG.MethodsThis phase 1 controlled human infection trial was conducted at two clinical research facilities in the UK. Healthy, immunocompetent adults aged 18–50 years, who were both M tuberculosis-naive and BCG-naive and had no history of asthma or other respiratory diseases, were eligible for the trial. Participants were initially enrolled into group 1 (receiving the BCG Danish strain); the trial was subsequently paused because of a worldwide shortage of BCG Danish and, after protocol amendment, was restarted using the BCG Bulgaria strain (group 2). After a dose-escalation study, during which participants were sequentially allocated to receive either 1 × 103, 1 × 104, 1 × 105, 1 × 106, or 1 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) of aerosol BCG, the maximum tolerated dose was selected for the randomised controlled trial. Participants in this trial were randomly assigned (9:12), by variable block randomisation and using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes, to receive aerosol BCG (1 × 107 CFU) and intradermal saline or intradermal BCG (1 × 106 CFU) and aerosol saline. Participants were masked to treatment allocation until day 14. The primary outcome was to compare the safety of a controlled human infection model based on aerosol-inhaled BCG versus one based on intradermally administered BCG, and the secondary outcome was to evaluate BCG recovery in the airways of participants who received aerosol BCG or skin biopsies of participants who received intradermal BCG. BCG was detected by culture and by PCR. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02709278, and is complete.FindingsParticipants were assessed for eligibility between April 7, 2016, and Sept 29, 2018. For group 1, 15 participants were screened, of whom 13 were enrolled and ten completed the study; for group 2, 60 were screened and 33 enrolled, all of whom completed the study. Doses up to 1 × 107 CFU aerosol-inhaled BCG were sufficiently well tolerated. No significant difference was observed in the frequency of adverse events between aerosol and intradermal groups (median percentage of solicited adverse events per participant, post-aerosol vs post-intradermal BCG: systemic 7% [IQR 2–11] vs 4% [1–13], p=0·62; respiratory 7% [1–19] vs 4% [1–9], p=0·56). More severe systemic adverse events occurred in the 2 weeks after aerosol BCG (15 [12%] of 122 reported systemic adverse events) than after intradermal BCG (one [1%] of 94; difference 11% [95% CI 5–17]; p=0·0013), but no difference was observed in the severity of respiratory adverse events (two [1%] of 144 vs zero [0%] of 97; 1% [−1 to 3]; p=0·52). All adverse events after aerosol BCG resolved spontaneously. One serious adverse event was reported—a participant in group 2 was admitted to hospital to receive analgesia for a pre-existing ovarian cyst, which was deemed unrelated to BCG infection. On day 14, BCG was cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage samples after aerosol infection and from skin biopsy samples after intradermal infection.InterpretationThis first-in-human aerosol BCG controlled human infection model was sufficiently well tolerated. Further work will evaluate the utility of this model in assessing vaccine efficacy and identifying potential correlates of protection.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley Clinical Research Network, and TBVAC2020.",0
"PurposeEwing sarcoma (ES) is one of the most common malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents. The immune microenvironment plays an important role in the development of ES. Here, we developed an optimal signature for determining ES patient prognosis based on immune-related genes (IRGs).MethodsWe analyzed the ES gene expression profile dataset, GSE17679, from the GEO database and extracted differential expressed IRGs (DEIRGs). Then, we conducted functional correlation and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses of the DEIRGs and used the machine learning algorithm-iterative Lasso Cox regression analysis to build an optimal DEIRG signature. In addition, we applied ES samples from the ICGC database to test the optimal gene signature. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regressions on clinicopathological characteristics and optimal gene signature to evaluate whether signature is an important prognostic factor. Finally, we calculated the infiltration of 24 immune cells in ES using the ssGSEA algorithm, and analyzed the correlation between the DEIRGs in the optimal gene signature and immune cells.ResultsA total of 249 DEIRGs were screened and an 11-gene signature with the strongest correlation with patient prognoses was analyzed using a machine learning algorithm. The 11-gene signature also had a high prognostic value in the ES external verification set. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that 11-gene signature is an independent prognostic factor. We found that macrophages and cytotoxic, CD8 T, NK, mast, B, NK CD56bright, TEM, TCM, and Th2 cells were significantly related to patient prognoses; the infiltration of cytotoxic and CD8 T cells in ES was significantly different. By correlating prognostic biomarkers with immune cell infiltration, we found that FABP4 and macrophages, and NDRG1 and Th2 cells had the strongest correlation.ConclusionOverall, the IRG-related 11-gene signature can be used as a reliable ES prognostic biomarker and can provide guidance for personalized ES therapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03396-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","AbstractThe advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented potential for the targeted manipulation of DNA sequences.

"AbstractBackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in China. Most HCC patients have the complications of chronic liver disease and need overall consideration and whole-course management, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. To develop a reasonable, long-term, and complete management plan, multiple factors need to be considered, including the patient’s general condition, basic liver diseases, tumor stage, tumor biological characteristics, treatment requirements, and economic cost.SummaryTo better guide the whole-course management of HCC patients, the Chinese Association of Liver Cancer and the Chinese Medical Doctor Association has gathered multidisciplinary experts and scholars in relevant fields to formulate the “Chinese Expert Consensus on The Whole-Course Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma .”Key MessagesThis expert consensus, based on the current clinical evidence and experience, proposes surgical and nonsurgical HCC management pathways and involves 18 recommendations, including perioperative treatment, systematic treatment combined with local treatment, conversion treatment, special population management, symptomatic support treatment, and follow-up management.","Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) limits therapeutic effectiveness by interacting with the PD-1 receptor on host immune cells. Targeting the secretion of sEV PD-L1 has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy. However, the lack of small-molecule inhibitors poses a challenge for clinical translation. In this study, we developed a target and phenotype dual-driven high-throughput screening strategy that combined virtual screening with nanoflow-based experimental verification. We identified ibuprofen (IBP) as a novel inhibitor that effectively targeted sEV PD-L1 secretion. IBP disrupted the biogenesis and secretion of PD-L1+ sEVs in tumor cells by physically interacting with a critical regulator of sEV biogenesis, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate. Notably, the mechanism of action of IBP is distinct from its commonly known targets, cyclooxygenases. Administration of IBP stimulated antitumor immunity and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma mouse models. To address potential adverse effects, we further developed an IBP gel for topical application, which demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy when combined with anti-PD-1 treatment. The discovery of this specific small inhibitor provides a promising avenue for establishing durable, systemic antitumor immunity.",0
"Herein, we performed a virtual screening study to discover new scaffolds for small molecule-based ligands of the immune checkpoint lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the LAG-3 structure revealed two putative binding sites for small molecules: the antibody interface and the lipophilic canyon. A 3D pharmacophore screening resulted in the identification of potential ligands for these binding sites and afforded a library of 25 compounds. We then evaluated the screening hits for LAG-3 binding via microscale thermophoresis (MST) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Our biophysical screening identified two binders with KD values in the low micromolar range, compounds 3 (antibody interface) and 25 (lipophilic canyon). Furthermore, we investigated the ability of LAG-3 hits to engage LAG-3 on a cellular level using a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). In summary, compound 3 shows potential as a lead but is not yet a development candidate.","BackgroundQingre huazhuo tang (QRHZT) is a traditional Chinese medicine decoction that has been used clinically by traditional Chinese medicine masters for more than 50 years with good results. However, its mechanism is unknown, and further elucidation is necessary.Aim of the studyTo verify the mechanism by which QRHZT regulates IgA nephropathy through immune checkpoints and ferroptosis by combining network pharmacology, single-cell sequencing and experimental studies.Materials and methodsThe single-cell sequencing data obtained from podocytes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) patients were screened, and the QRHZT target information was obtained from the ETCM database. Moreover, the KEGG, GSEA, immune checkpoint and ferroptosis data were analyzed and plotted using R language.

"BackgroundLow-grade glioma (LGG) is a crucial pathological type of glioma. The present study aimed to explore multiple RNA methylation regulator-related AS events and investigate their prognostic values in LGG.MethodsThe prognostic model for low-grade glioma was established using the LASSO regression analysis. To validate prognostic value, we performed Kaplan–Maier survival analysis, ROC curves and nomograms. The ESTIMATE algorithm, the CIBERSORT algorithm and the ssGSEA algorithm were utilized to explore the role of the immune microenvironment in LGG. Subsequently, we then used GO, KEGG and GSEA enrichment analysis to explore the functional roles of these genes. In addition, we employed the GDSC database to screen potential chemotherapeutic agents.ResultsEight RNA methylation related AS events were involved in construct a survival and prognosis model, which had good ability of independent prediction for patients with LGG. Patients in the high-risk group had shorter life expectancy and higher mortality, while patients in the low-risk group had a better prognosis. We constructed a nomogram which showed an excellent predictive performance for individual OS. The risk score exhibited a close correlation with some immune cells and expression of immune checkpoints. Patients in high-risk group were characterized by immunosuppressive microenvironment and poor response to immunotherapy, and were sensitive to more chemotherapeutic drugs. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses further confirmed that significant differences existed in immune landscape between the two subgroups.ConclusionThe prognostic RNA methylation-related alternative splicing signature constructed could constitute a promising prognostic biomarker, which could serve to optimize treatment regimens.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04431-1.","IntroductionCharacterized by vast heterogeneity, gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. A specific prognostic model is necessary for the improvement of clinical treatment strategies. Hypoxia is a common feature in the tumor microenvironment that promotes tumor progression. However, the current evaluation of the hypoxic tumor immune microenvironment in GC is still inadequate.Material and methodsWith sequence data and single nucleotide variants data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas-STAD dataset as well as hypoxia- and immune-related genes acquired from MsigDB and ImmPort, a hypoxia-immune-based gene signature of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) was built by Cox regression analysis. The risk score could be used as an independent prognostic factor.ResultsThe receiver operating characteristic curve and survival curve showed the accuracy of the model. Pearson correlation analysis showed that DUSP1, one of the hypoxia- and immune-related feature genes, was positively correlated with immune cell scores and immune-related function scores. In addition, low-risk group peers were found to be in higher immune infiltration status and had a higher immunophenoscore as demonstrated by single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), indicating a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment among the low-risk group. q-PCR results showed that DUSP1, IGFBP1, CGB5, GPC3 and EGF were significantly highly expressed in STAD cells, while FAM3D and FGF8 were significantly down-regulated.ConclusionsOverall, our study not only paves the way for future studies focusing on hypoxia and the immune microenvironment but also improves STAD patients’ prognosis and their response to immunotherapy.",0

It is alternatively referred to as mSWI/SNF and has been suggested to be imbalanced in human disease compared with human health. Three types of BAF assemblies associated with it have been described, including  canonical BAF (cBAF),  polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), and  non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complexes. Each of these BAF assemblies plays a role, either functional or dysfunctional, in governing gene expression patterns, cellular processes, epigenetic mechanisms, and biological processes. Recent evidence increasingly links the dysregulation of mSWI/SNF complexes to various human non-malignant lung chronic disorders and lung malignant diseases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive general state-of-the-art and a profound examination of the current understanding of mSWI/SNF assembly processes, as well as the structural and functional organization of mSWI/SNF complexes and their subunits. In addition, it explores their intricate functional connections with potentially dysregulated transcription factors, placing particular emphasis on molecular and cellular pathogenic processes in lung diseases. These processes are reflected in human epigenome aberrations that impact clinical and therapeutic levels, suggesting novel perspectives on the diagnosis and molecular therapies for human respiratory diseases.",1
"PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity.

In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.","BackgroundAccumulating evidence suggests that anoikis resistance is a key process in cancer cell metastasis, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Therefore, anoikis may become a new treatment for gastric cancer.MethodsWe used the univariate Cox regression method to screen gastric cancer-related anoikis genes, and a prognostic risk model was established. We analyzed differences between high- and low-risk groups in terms of tumor infiltrating immune cells, gene mutation signatures, and treatment of gastric cancer. Analysis of model associated genes at single-cell resolution was performed.ResultsWe filtered to 12 anoikis-related genes and built a prognostic risk model using seven of them, which performed well in multiple datasets. Patients with CCDC178 mutations had a worse prognosis. We also found that patients at low risk were more likely to benefit from chemotherapy and immunotherapy. ERBB2 was found to be highly expressed in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Our analysis also indicated that gastric cancer samples with high infiltration of iCAFs had a worse prognosis.ConclusionSeven anoikis-related genes were selected to establish a risk model. The model can be used to predict the prognosis of patients and guide the drug treatment, which provides a new idea for the evaluation and treatment of gastric cancer patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05157-4.",0
"AbstractSuperficial cancers typically refer to cancers confined to the surface layers of tissue. Low-targeting therapies or side effects prompt exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), due to their unique optical properties, serve as effective photosensitizers, enabling tumor ablation through photothermal therapy (PTT). PTT induced by AuNPs can be achieved through light sources externally applied to the skin. Near-infrared radiation is the main light candidate due to its deep tissue penetration capability. This review explores recent advancements in AuNP-based PTT for superficial cancers, specifically breast, head and neck, thyroid, bladder and prostate cancers. Additionally, challenges and future directions in utilizing AuNPs for cancer treatment are discussed, emphasizing the importance of balancing efficacy with safety in clinical applications.","Antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapy has become one of the most promising approaches in cancer immunotherapy. Bispecific targeting could enhance the efficacy and safety of ADC by improving its specificity, affinity and internalization. In this study we constructed a HER2/HER3-targeting bispecific ADC (BsADC) and characterized its physiochemical properties, target specificity and internalization in vitro, and assessed its anti-tumor activities in breast cancer cell lines and in animal models. The HER2/HER3-targeting BsADC had a drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of 2.89, displayed a high selectivity against the target JIMT-1 breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as a slightly higher level of internalization than HER2- or HER3-monospecific ADCs. More importantly, the bispecific ADC potently inhibited the viability of MCF7, JIMT-1, BT474, BxPC-3 and SKOV-3 cancer cells in vitro. In JIMT-1 breast cancer xenograft mice, a single injection of bispecific ADC (3 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly inhibited the tumor growth with an efficacy comparable to that caused by combined injection of HER2 and HER3-monospecific ADCs (3 mg/kg for each). Our study demonstrates that the bispecific ADC concept can be applied to development of more potent new cancer therapeutics than the monospecific ADCs.",1
"PurposeTo compare the toxicity and clinical efficacy of TL (docetaxel + lobaplatin) induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy and TPF (docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Methods and patientsIn total, 128 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled between August 2016 and April 2021. They were randomly divided into trial group and control group, all using chronological dosage mode. The trial group used TL regimen induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy; the control group used TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The endpoints were adverse events and survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years.ResultsMedian follow-up was 42 months (20–71 months).  Adverse events: During induction chemotherapy, compared with TPF group, grade 3–4 leukocytes and neutrophils, diarrhea, 1–2 hyperbilirubinemia, nausea / vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, hyponatremia were significantly lower in TL group (p<0. 05): 6% vs. 35%, 14% vs. 53%, 0% vs. 6%, 15% vs. 40%, 9% vs. 56%, 0% vs. 10%, 3% vs. 13%, 2% vs. 23%, 15% vs. 74%. During chemoradiotherapy, the incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalaemia and grade 1–2 nausea was significantly lower in the TL group (p<0. 05), with 24% vs. 69%, 20% vs. 65% and 24% vs. 44%, respectively. However, more grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia were observed in the TL group (15% vs. 3%, p<0. 05).  There was no significant difference in the recent objective response rate (ORR) between patients with TL group and TPF group (p=0.961).  There was no statistical difference in 1, 3 and 5 years OS between TL group and TPF group, respectively, (71.0% vs. 67.5%, p=0.573), (56.6% vs. 56.9%, p=0.814), (52.5% vs. 52.9%, p=0.841); 1, 3 and 5 years PFS are: (63.4% vs. 64.0%, p=0.883), (51.1% vs. 54.0%, p=0.705) and (47.3% vs. 45.9%, p=0.887), None of them were significantly different. Multivariate analysis of COX regression showed that T stage (p=0.01) and surgery (p=0.046) were independent factors affecting PFS and OS, respectively. OS subgroup analysis shows that people receiving the TL regimen in postoperative and nodal stage N1 and N2 patients tended to survive longer than those receiving the TPF regimen.ConclusionPatients with postoperative, N1 or N2 stage locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may have more significant clinical benefits when treated with TL regimen. TL regimen has advantages in reducing toxic side effects and can be used as one of the first-line treatment options.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03117257).","PurposeAlthough immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to be effective in many clinical trials, real-world data remain limited. We investigated the outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received nivolumab, with an emphasis on hyper-progressive disease (HPD).MethodsThis retrospective study enrolled stage IV NSCLC patients who received nivolumab after progression on prior chemotherapy between July 2016 and June 2018 at a single center in Korea. HPD was defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors as progression at the first evaluation, with a ≥ two-fold increase in the tumor growth rate during nivolumab treatment.ResultsA total of 83 patients with a median age of 60 years were enrolled [squamous, 25(30%) and non-squamous, 58(70%)]. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82–4.31] and 8.6 months (95% CI 5.56–11.59), respectively. HPD developed in 16 (19.2%). The median OS of HPD patients was 2.2 months (95% CI 0.92–3.75) compared with 4.1 months for progressive disease (PD) patients without HPD (95% CI 1.54–6.67). Among patients with pleura or pericardium metastasis, increased effusion was seen more frequently in HPD patients compared with PD patients without HPD [90% (9/10) vs. 28.6% (4/14); p = 0.005]. HPD patients also showed a significant decrease in circulating albumin after treatment with nivolumab (p = 0.030).ConclusionAlthough the efficacy of nivolumab in real-world patients was comparable to that seen in clinical trials, clinicians should be aware of HPD because it is not uncommon and represents a worse prognosis.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03293-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"Objectives:We previously reported that palbociclib, a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, given with cetuximab, resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 19% in cetuximab-resistant human papillomavirus (HPV)-unrelated head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study, we aimed to determine the proportion of patients with cetuximab-resistant HPV-related oropharynx (OP)SCC who achieved an objective response to palbociclib and cetuximab.Materials and Methods:We performed a multicenter phase 2 trial. Key eligibility requirements included measurable HPV-related OPSCC that progressed on a cetuximab-containing regimen. Palbociclib 125 mg po was administered on Days 1–21 of 28 day cycles, with weekly cetuximab. The primary endpoint was objective response (RECIST1.1). The study design had a probability of 0.70 of accepting the alternative hypothesis (ORR ≥ 20%) and rejecting the null hypothesis (ORR ≤ 5%). Two or more tumor responses among 24 patients were needed to accept the alternative hypothesis.Results:Twenty-four patients enrolled. The median interval from prior cetuximab to study enrollment was 0.7 months (IQR 0.2–6.1). Disease progression on a platinum agent occurred in 23 patients (96%). An objective response occurred in one patient (ORR 4%). The duration of response was 4 months. Stable disease with ≥ 10% decrease in target lesions occurred in 2 patients (8%). Median follow-up was 8.9 (IQR 3.7–16.8) months. The median progression-free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI 1.8–2.1) and the median overall survival was 17.1 months (95%CI: 5.8–21.5).Conclusion:The trial did not meet its primary endpoint. Further investigation of palbociclib and cetuximab in cetuximab-resistant HPV-related OPSCC is not warranted.","In locally advanced head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC), clinical complete response (cCR) at the primary site, assessed by clinical examination, after induction chemotherapy predicts for a low relapse risk after subsequent chemoradiotherapy. Prior studies showed a cCR rate of 77% with induction nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel given with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (APF). The primary aims of this non-randomized phase 2 trial were to determine the cCR rate after induction nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin (Arm 1) and after nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (Arm 2). Eligibility required LA-HNSCC, T2-T4 stage classification, and suitable (Arm 1) or unsuitable (Arm 2) candidates for cisplatin. Arm 1 patients received nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin, then cisplatin with radiation. Arm 2 patients received nab-paclitaxel, then cetuximab with radiation. The primary endpoint was cCR after two cycles of induction chemotherapy. Each arm enrolled forty patients. cCR at the primary site occurred in 28 patients (70%) after nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin and in 8 patients (20%) after nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. The overall clinical response rate was 98% after nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin and 90% after nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. In subset analyses, cCR rates by T stage classifications (T2, T3, T4) were 54, 86, and 69% after nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin, and 14, 11, and 26% after nab-paclitaxel. cCR rates by human papillomavirus status (p16 positive oropharynx vs other) were 72 and 64% after nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin and 35 and 9% after nab-paclitaxel. The cCR rate after nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin was similar to APF; however, the cCR rate after nab-paclitaxel monotherapy was lower. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02573493 on October 9, 2015.",1
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematologic malignancy. Chemotherapy resistance results in a dismal survival rate of 1–2 years in older adults with AML. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently required. In this context, microRNA (miRNA)-based treatments remain an untapped strategy in AML. Using patient-derived specimens, we found increased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of older adults with AML, and decreased miR-497-5p in CD34+ leukemic blasts. Target prediction revealed that miR-497-5p could directly target mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAP2K1) mRNA to indirectly target cytokines and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway through the p38-MAPK signaling pathway, potentially inhibiting leukemic growth and overcoming chemoresistance from venetoclax. To improve miRNA delivery and minimize off-target effects, which represent key barriers to clinical translation, we developed liposomes for co-delivery of miR-497-5p and venetoclax. We decorated our liposomes with a peptide targeting CLL1, which is present on 92% of leukemia blasts while being absent in normal hematopoietic cells. This targeted approach demonstrated high efficacy in inhibiting AML growth in mice with minimal toxicity, as well as reduced exposure to chemoresistance. Our findings suggested that anti-CLL1-decorated, miR-497-5p, and venetoclax-loaded liposomes represent a promising novel miRNA-based therapeutic, which should be investigated further as a strategy to reduce venetoclax resistance in AML.","IntroductionNanotechnology has shown potential in treating different types of cancers. In particular, nano-drug delivery systems (DDSs) offer a promising strategy for treating oral cancer. By customizing therapy and improving drug delivery, these systems can improve outcomes for patients. Hence, a review was conducted to assess the current evidence and explore the use of DDSs for treating oral cancer.AimTo comprehensively explore the nano-drug carriers and target delivery for oral cancer therapy and to discuss the benefits, challenges, and potential to guide future research and clinical practice.MethodologyA systematic search of articles archived in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane using keywords such as Nano, drug carrier, target drug delivery, and oral cancer was performed to fulfill the objectives from inception till February 2, 2024. Articles providing insights into nano-drug carriers in oral cancer were included.ResultsThe results revealed a total of 156 articles. After duplicate removal, 136 articles were screened for title and abstract as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 113 articles were excluded with reasons. Out of the remaining 23 articles, only 11 were included for qualitative data synthesis.ConclusionThe literature revealed scarcity of oral cancer-related work using DDSs. Qualitative synthesis of data revealed that nano-drug carriers demonstrated a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic approaches in oral cancer, despite the challenges and their potential benefits. Continued research and development in this field are crucial to overcoming these challenges and fully realizing the potential of nano-drug carriers in revolutionizing oral cancer therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12663-024-02251-z.",0
"AbstractIntroductionAdjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluated the effects of adjuvant ICI treatment duration on RFS and overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence.MethodsThe RFS and OS of patients from three centers who received either adjuvant ICI therapy or active surveillance after curative hepatic resection between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, were analyzed. Further analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of ICI treatment duration on RFS and OS.ResultsA total of 1,271 patients were included, of whom 1,032 (81.2%) received active surveillance and 239 (18.8%) received adjuvant ICI therapy. The median RFS in the adjuvant therapy cohort was 22.6 months (95% CI 18.3–26.9), significantly higher than the RFS of 19.1 months (95% CI 16.4–21.4) in the active surveillance cohort (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66–0.95; p = 0.019). The median OS was not reached for either group, but OS tended to be better in the adjuvant therapy cohort than in the active surveillance group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.94; p = 0.010). Similar results were obtained after propensity score matching. Among patients who received adjuvant ICI therapy, those who received it for longer than 6 months had slightly higher RFS (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42–1.04; p = 0.071) and OS (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.30–1.17; p = 0.128) than those who received it for up to 6 months.ConclusionsAdjuvant ICI therapy significantly improves the prognosis of patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after curative resection. Six months of adjuvant ICI treatment may be insufficient.","IntroductionThe benefits of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for heterogeneous pathological N2 (pN2) diseases remain unclear in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate suitable pN2 patients for adjuvant CRT.Material and methodsThis study retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with pN2 NSCLC in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital from January 2012 to December 2016. Included cases were subdivided as highest mediastinal lymph node (HM) (n = 732) metastasis and non-HM metastasis (n = 677) groups according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). Furthermore, the Kaplan–Meier and Cox models were used to evaluate the prognostic benefits of adjuvant CRT in heterogeneous pN2 subgroups.ResultsA total of 1409 patients were enrolled in this study, with a median follow-up time of 63.8 months. Patients with HM involvement had worse prognoses (p < 0.001 for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)). Furthermore, the survival improvement of adjuvant CRT was significant for these patients (p < 0.001 for RFS and p = 0.032 for OS), regardless of whether it was single (p < 0.001 for RFS and p = 0.029 for OS) or multiple pN2 (p < 0.001 for RFS and p = 0.026 for OS) diseases. According to multivariable cox analysis, the long-term RFS and OS in the cancerous HM group were independently predicted by pathological N stage (p = 0.002 for RFS and p < 0.001 for OS) and adjuvant CRT (p < 0.001 for RFS and p = 0.011 for OS).ConclusionMetastatic HM was associated with a worse prognosis in pN2 disease. Our analysis supported that adjuvant CRT significantly improved both RFS and OS for these patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05101-6.",1

Here we retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third- or further-line treatment in patients with refractory SCLC.Patients and methodsA total of 40 patients with refractory SCLC treated with anlotinib monotherapy were included in this study. The clinicopathological data, treatment information, survival data and safety data were retrospectively collected. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed by log-rank testing.ResultsAltogether, 40 patients of extensive-stage SCLC or progressive limited-stage SCLC received anlotinib monotherapy as third- or further-line treatment from July 2018 to June 2020. Four patients achieved partial response (PR), 14 patients achieved stable disease (SD), no complete response (CR) was recorded, and 22 patients experienced progressive disease (PD). The disease control rate (DCR) was 45.0%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.241–3.759), and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.8 months (95% CI 3.190–12.410). The common adverse effects (AEs) included hypertension, fatigue, anorexia, cough, rash and nausea. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 3 (7.5%) patients. One patient interrupted anlotinib treatment due to repeated grade 1 epistaxis. Univariate analysis revealed that patients without liver metastases, previously treated with radiotherapy or with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0 or 1 had longer OS with anlotinib treatment. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients without liver metastases and patients with ECOG score ≤ 1 had longer PFS, while patients without liver metastases had longer OS.ConclusionAnlotinib is beneficial to refractory SCLC as third- or further-line treatment, especially in patients without liver metastasis and with better physical status. Related adverse effects are tolerable and manageable.",1
"AbstractExosomes are extracellular vesicles that are released from most cell types encapsulating specific molecular cargo. Exosomes serve as mediators of cell‐to‐cell and tissue‐to‐tissue communications under normal and pathological conditions. It has been shown that exosomes carrying muscle‐specific miRNAs, myomiRs, are secreted from skeletal muscle cells in vitro and are elevated in the blood of muscle disease patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the secretion of exosomes encapsulating the four myomiRs from skeletal muscle tissues and to assess their role in inter‐tissue communication between neighboring skeletal muscles in vivo. We demonstrate, for the first time, that isolated, intact skeletal muscle tissues secrete exosomes encapsulating the four myomiRs, miR‐1, miR‐133a, miR‐133b, and miR‐206. Notably, we show that the sorting of the four myomiRs within exosomes varies between skeletal muscles of different muscle fiber‐type composition. miR‐133a and miR‐133b downregulation in TA muscles caused a reduction of their levels in neighboring skeletal muscles and in serum exosomes. In conclusion, our results reveal that skeletal muscle‐derived exosomes encapsulate the four myomiRs, some of which enter the blood, while a portion is used for the local communication between proximal muscle tissues. These findings provide important evidence regarding novel pathways implicated in skeletal muscle function.","There is a critical need for biomarkers of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in organ transplantation. We hypothesized that ACR leads to changes in donor-reactive T cell small extracellular vesicle (sEV) profiles in transplant recipient circulation that match the kinetics of alloreactive T cell activation. In rodent heart transplantation, circulating T cell sEV quantities (P < .0001) and their protein and mRNA cargoes showed time-specific expression of alloreactive and regulatory markers heralding early ACR in allogeneic transplant recipients but not in syngeneic transplant recipients. Next generation sequencing of their microRNA cargoes identified novel candidate biomarkers of ACR, which were validated by stem loop quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (n = 10). Circulating T cell sEVs enriched from allogeneic transplant recipients mediated targeted cytotoxicity of donor cardiomyocytes by apoptosis assay (P < .0001). Translation of the concept and EV methodologies to clinical heart transplantation demonstrated similar upregulation of circulating T cell sEV profiles at time points of grade 2 ACR (n = 3 patients). Furthermore, T cell receptor sequencing of T cell sEV mRNA cargo demonstrated expression of T cell clones with intact complementarity determining region 3 signals. These data support the diagnostic potential of T cell sEVs as noninvasive biomarker of ACR and suggest their potential functional roles.",1
"AbstractAIMSThe QUARTZ trial  reported that corticosteroid therapy was non-inferior to whole brain radiotherapy(WBRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with regards overall survival(OS). This is a single centre experience of WBRT for NSCLC in the post-QUARTZ era and in the context of the changes in clinical practice over the past 8 years.METHODSingle centre retrospective observational study. Patients included with NSCLC treated with WBRT for radiologically conﬁrmed intracranial (IC) metastatic disease January 2018 to December 2022. OS, baseline tumour/patient characteristics and lines of treatment were recorded from medical records. Data compiled using Excel and statistical analysis using the R language for statistical programming.RESULTS62 patients were included, median age 64 (37 -82). 29(46.8%) were Performance status 0-1. 50(80.6%) received 20Gy in 5 fractions, 12(19.4%) received 30Gy in 10 fractions. PDL1 >50% in 14(22.6%), EGFR mutation positive in 10(16.1%), 0(0%) ALK/ROS mutations. 9(14.5%) had received prior radiotherapy(RT) for IC disease (SRS:8, partial brain VMAT:1). 20(32.3%) had IC disease at presentation. Median OS 68 days (95%CI:58-111;range12-777) in keeping with QUARTZ results (median OS 65 days, 95%CI:50- 78). Univariate analyses demonstrated: subsequent systemic therapy (p=0.0022), receiving immunotherapy (p=0.002) and baseline performance status (p=0.0017) associated with improved OS. PDL1 >50%, EGFR mutation positive, RT dose, prior systemic therapy, histological subtype, presence of a targetable mutation, ﬁrst or subsequent IC treatment did not predict survival. The chi-squared test was used to compare differences in the groups with OS>100days(n=22) and OS<100days(n=40). Systemic therapy after WBRT(p=0.0011) and immunotherapy treatment(p=0.0092) were signiﬁcant differences between the cohorts and associated with improved survival.CONCLUSIONThis data supports conclusions of QUARTZ study and it remains diﬃcult to deﬁne a role for WBRT in the management of IC disease in NSCLC. There is a cohort who have better OS, though we believe this may be related to systemic therapy (particularly immunotherapy) exposure.","We describe diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in this rare entity of CD20-negative B cell lymphomas. They comprise only 1 to 2% of all B cell lymphoma with four subcategories. However, with an increasing understanding of these cases, novel entities have been recognized. Workup, treatment, and follow-up of two CD20-negative B cell lymphoma cases, including a novel entity, have been described. A novel case of triple expresser CD20-negative B cell lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma has been diagnosed. The absence of CD20 leads to the abolishment of the targeted drug (rituximab) from the treatment regimen. These cases render the importance of extensive immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization workup for diagnosis of this rare entity. Treatment also remains a challenge as immunotherapy with CD20-targeted drugs cannot be given.",0
"AbstractBackgroundEarly‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in adults is commonly treated with combined modality treatment of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The role of radiotherapy has been questioned due to potential long‐term adverse effects.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.Search methodsWe updated all previous searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, MEDLINE and Embase, in trial registries and in relevant conference proceedings until November 2023.Selection criteriaWe included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and excluded trials with more than 20% of participants with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. We considered immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy eligible if both were applied similarly in the comparator groups, but did not identify such trials. For our comparisons, we separated RCTs with the same number of chemotherapy cycles in both arms and RCTs with a different number of cycles, when the chemotherapy regimens were the same. We separated RCTs which compared participants with a favourable, mixed or unfavourable risk profile.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of included trials. A third review author resolved discrepancies. We analysed time‐to‐event outcomes (overall survival, progression‐free survival) as hazard ratios (HR) and binary outcomes (adverse events) as risk ratios (RR). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.Main resultsWe included nine comparisons of eight RCTs involving 3840 participants in this updated review.Same number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseFor overall survival in individuals with favourable Hodgkin's lymphoma, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 7.92; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). Additional radiotherapy to chemotherapy is likely to improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.01 to 74.24; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and substantial imprecision) and suggests little to no difference in cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.16; 1 RCT, 667 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality or infertility.Mixed populationFor a population of mixed risk profile, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.80; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). It indicates that additional radiotherapy may lead to an improvement in progression‐free survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 10.87; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) and second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) (both very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but suggests that additional radiotherapy may increase cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.92; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with unfavourable disease, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.44; 2 RCTs, 688 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but additional radiotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.60; 1 RCT, 651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to imprecision). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.12 to 65.74; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality, second‐cancer related mortality or infertility.Different number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseThe evidence for overall survival in individuals with favourable disease treated with different numbers of chemotherapy cycles in both arms is uncertain and inclusive (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.38; 1 RCT, 357 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), yet it suggests a likely improvement in progression‐free survival with additional radiotherapy (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 RCT, 357 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). For second‐cancer‐related mortality, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.34; 1 RCT, 465 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality and infertility and data for cardiac disease‐related mortality were not estimable (no events in either group).Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with an unfavourable risk profile, additional radiotherapy may decrease overall survival slightly (HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.90; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision), but may slightly improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 6.90, 95% CI 0.36 to 132.34; 1 RCT, 276 participants), second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.77 to 6.19; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) and cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 8.22; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) (all very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Authors' conclusionsThe chemotherapy regimens in the trials differed and data for regimens commonly used today were limited. Additional radiotherapy may slightly improve progression‐free survival. The available data for overall survival and adverse events were of low and very low certainty, and we were unable to draw conclusions about the effects of additional radiotherapy on these outcomes. No studies evaluated infertility. High‐quality, longer‐term follow‐up data are required and data on fertility are needed.","AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.",1
"The utilization of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, specifically anti-PD-1/L1 agents, prior to radical cystectomy is an emerging paradigm in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). In situ vaccination represents a strategy to manipulate the tumor in order to augment the immune response toward improved local and distant cancer control. The authors describe the study rationale, design and objectives for RAD VACCINE MIBC, a single-arm, single-institution, phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of combination neoadjuvant sasanlimab (humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1) with stereotactic body radiotherapy as an in situ vaccine in cisplatin-ineligible patients with MIBC. The results from this trial will establish the safety profile of this combination strategy and evaluate pathologic complete response rates.","AbstractMost patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have limited treatment options following standard-of-care therapy. VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05425940 (ClinicalTrials.gov)",1
"PurposeAnlotinib is an oral small-molecule multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor that hampers neovascularization thus providing antitumor effect. The ALTER 0303 trial was a multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The ALTER 0303 results showed that patients in the anlotinib group had a median progression-free survival of 5.4 months, a significant improvement compared with 1.4 months in the placebo group; however, median overall survival was only extended by 3.3 months (9.6 vs 6.3 months). The problem of anlotinib resistance cannot be ignored, and an in-depth exploration of biomarkers of anlotinib treatment response is urgently needed to further improve the efficacy of anlotinib in the treatment of NSCLC. This study aimed to identify plasma exosome markers that could be used to monitor the efficacy of anlotinib.MethodsWe enrolled 5 patients with advanced NSCLC, and 15 blood samples were collected before anlotinib treatment, when the treatment was effective, and when the treatment was ineffective. The plasma exosomal RNA profiles were analyzed by whole-transcriptome sequencing at three different stages. The expression of dysregulated exosomal RNAs in 43 additional patients was also verified by real-time quantitative PCR.ResultsIn the plasma exosomal RNA profiles of the 5 patients with advanced NSCLC during treatment with anlotinib, 7 miRNAs, 3 lncRNAs, and 83 mRNAs were significantly dysregulated. The regulation trend was opposite when the treatment was effective and ineffective, showing dynamic changes. After validation, we finally found that plasma exosomal lnc-SNAPC5-3:4 was significantly upregulated when anlotinib treatment was effective, and it was significantly downregulated when the treatment failed (p < 0.05). Thus, it can be used as a potential biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of anlotinib.ConclusionOur results demonstrate the potential of plasma exosomal lnc-SNAPC5-3:4 as a biomarker for monitoring anlotinib efficacy.","BackgroundAn increasing number of studies have focused on the early diagnostic value of the methylation of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer. However, the intricate cellular events related to RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer are still a mystery. For researchers and clinicians aiming to more profoundly understand the diagnostic value of methylated RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, this review will provide deeper insights into the molecular events of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer.MethodologyWe searched for relevant publications in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using the keywords “RASSF1A”, “SHOX2” and “lung cancer” etc. First, we reviewed the RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes, from their family structures to the functions of their basic structural domains. Then we mainly focused on the roles of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, especially on their molecular events in recent decades. Finally, we compared the value of measuring RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation with that of the common methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer patients.ResultsThe RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes were confirmed to be regulators or effectors of multiple cancer signaling pathways, driving tumorigenesis and lung cancer progression. The detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation has higher sensitivity and specificity than other commonly used methods for diagnosing lung cancer, especially in the early stage.ConclusionsThe RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes are critical for the processes of tumorigenesis, development, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence in lung cancer. The combined detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation was identified as an excellent method for the screening and surveillance of lung cancer that exhibits high sensitivity and specificity.",0
"PurposeTo enhance the antitumor effects of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibodies, it is important to reverse cancer-induced immunosuppression. We previously reported that a localized renin–angiotensin system in the tumor microenvironment inhibited tumor immunity via macrophages. In this study, we analyzed the underlying mechanism through which fibroblasts express tumor immunity influenced by the angiotensin receptor.MethodsWe used an angiotensin receptor inhibitor (ARB) to inhibit renin–angiotensin system. Furthermore, angiotensin receptors were knocked out from mice fibroblasts, which were then collected. The fibroblasts and a malignant melanoma were then transfused into a mouse model and tumor immunity response was analyzed.ResultsFibroblasts produced CC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) on renin–angiotensin system stimulation, and this production decreased after ARB administration. In mice with transplanted malignant melanoma, ARB administration resulted in decreased CCL5 concentration in the blood, increase in tumor-infiltrating T cells, decrease in regulatory T cells, as well as an increase in tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. The mice in which the angiotensin receptor knockout fibroblasts and malignant melanoma were transplanted showed a similar decrease in CCL5 concentration and increased tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. Furthermore, ARB and anti-PD-1 antibody were administered in combination, which resulted in significantly better tumor growth inhibition over monotherapy.ConclusionInhibiting renin–angiotensin system restored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibited anti-PD-1 antibodies. Thus, this could be considered a valid approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Geographic accessibility predicts pediatric preventive care utilization, including vaccine uptake. However, spatial inequities in the pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination rollout remain underexplored. We assessed the spatial accessibility of vaccination sites and analyzed predictors of vaccine uptake.METHODS:In this cross-sectional study of pediatric COVID-19 vaccinations from the US Vaccine Tracking System as of July 29, 2022, we described spatial accessibility by geocoding vaccination sites, measuring travel times from each Census tract population center to the nearest site, and weighting tracts by their population demographics to obtain nationally representative estimates. We used quasi-Poisson regressions to calculate incidence rate ratios, comparing vaccine uptake between counties with highest and lowest quartile Social Vulnerability Index scores: socioeconomic status (SES), household composition and disability (HCD), minority status and language (MSL), and housing type and transportation.RESULTS:We analyzed 15 233 956 doses administered across 27 526 sites. Rural, uninsured, white, and Native American populations experienced longer travel times to the nearest site than urban, insured, Hispanic, Black, and Asian American populations. Overall Social Vulnerability Index, SES, and HCD were associated with decreased vaccine uptake among children aged 6 months to 4 years (overall: incidence rate ratio 0.70 [95% confidence interval 0.60–0.81]; SES: 0.66 [0.58–0.75]; HCD: 0.38 [0.33–0.44]) and 5 years to 11 years (overall: 0.85 [0.77–0.95]; SES: 0.71 [0.65–0.78]; HCD: 0.67 [0.61–0.74]), whereas social vulnerability by MSL was associated with increased uptake (6 months–4 years: 5.16 [3.59–7.42]; 5 years–11 years: 1.73 [1.44–2.08]).CONCLUSIONS:Pediatric COVID-19 vaccine uptake and accessibility differed by race, rurality, and social vulnerability. National supply data, spatial accessibility measurement, and place-based vulnerability indices can be applied throughout public health resource allocation, surveillance, and research.",0
"Currently, there are two approved vaccine regimens designed to prevent Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD). Both are virus-vectored, and concerns about cold-chain storage and pre-existing immunity to the vectors warrant investigating additional vaccine strategies. Here, we have explored the utility of adjuvanted recombinant glycoproteins (GPs) from ebolaviruses Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and Bundibugyo (BDBV) for inducing antibody (Ab) and T cell cross-reactivity. Glycoproteins expressed in insect cells were administered to C57BL/6 mice as free protein or bound to the surface of liposomes, and formulated with toll-like receptor agonists CpG and MPLA (agonists for TLR 9 and 4, respectively), with or without the emulsions AddaVax or TiterMax. The magnitude of Ab cross-reactivity in binding and neutralization assays, and T cell cross-reactivity in antigen recall assays, correlated with phylogenetic relatedness. While most adjuvants screened induced IgG responses, a combination of CpG, MPLA and AddaVax emulsion (“IVAX-1”) was the most potent and polarized in an IgG2c (Th1) direction. Breadth was also achieved by combining GPs into a trivalent (Tri-GP) cocktail with IVAX-1, which did not compromise antibody responses to individual components in binding and neutralizing assays. Th1 signature cytokines in T cell recall assays were undetectable after Tri-GP/IVAX-1 administration, despite a robust IgG2c response, although administration of Tri-GP on lipid nanoparticles in IVAX-1 elevated Th1 cytokines to detectable levels. Overall, the data indicate an adjuvanted trivalent recombinant GP approach may represent a path toward a broadly reactive, deployable vaccine against EVD.","PurposeThe treatment options for metastatic soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are limited. In most cases, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has not been successful so far. Macrophages dominate the immune landscape of STSs; thus, combinatorial strategies aiming at both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages may represent a particularly relevant treatment approach for metastatic or recurrent STSs.MethodsIn this cohort study, 66 patients who underwent surgery for STSs were enrolled. Tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In cell suspensions obtained from surgical resections, human T cells were activated by superparamagnetic polymer beads and cultured at a concentration of 0.3 × 106/µl in the absence or presence of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (anti-PD-1, anti-CD47, and anti-PD-1 + anti-CD47). Supernatants from cell suspensions were analyzed using multiplex Luminex cytokine bead-based immunoassays.ResultsThe most profound response to anti-CD47 therapy was observed in an undifferentiated pleiomorphic sarcoma which also displayed high expression of CD47 in the tumor microenvironment. Both anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 therapies drastically increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment of STSs, but co-administration of both agents did not further increase cytokine secretion. Furthermore, all patient samples treated with a combination of both anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 antibodies showed a dramatic reduction in cytokine secretion.ConclusionOur findings suggest that anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 therapies do not enhance each other, and the combined application of anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 agents in vitro limits rather than potentiates their efficacy.",0
"The rising prevalence of complementary alternative medicine (CAM), including for example, dietary supplements, massage, and acupuncture, among patients with cancer underscores the necessity of integrating open dialogue about complementary alternative medicine (OD-CAM) into oncology treatment and care.PURPOSEThis randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the impact of OD-CAM on patients' quality of life (QoL), emotional well-being, decision regret, and survival. Patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment were randomly allocated to receive standard care (SC) plus OD-CAM or SC alone. The primary end point was patient-reported QoL 8 weeks after enrollment. Secondary end points included patient-reported QoL, anxiety, depression, and decision regret at 12 and 24 weeks after enrollment and overall survival at 52 weeks after enrollment.MATERIALS AND METHODSPatient-reported outcomes were evaluated using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Computer Adaptive Test Core questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire, and the Decision Regret Scale.RESULTSA total of 210 patients were equally randomly assigned, leaving 105 patients in each group. No significant differences were observed in QoL, well-being, decision regret, or survival between the groups.CONCLUSIONOD-CAM did not demonstrate superiority over SC in enhancing the QoL and well-being of patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment. Increased levels of anxiety and fatigue might result from OD-CAM, underscoring the importance of the person-oriented approach inherent in OD-CAM. OD-CAM may hold clinical significance, especially for those already inclined toward CAM; however, further investigation into the essential components of OD-CAM and the characteristics of patients who are most likely to experience significant improvements of OD-CAM is recommended.","PurposeOlder patients with cancer are underrepresented in pivotal trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This study aimed to investigate immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that occur in older patients with lung cancer treated with ICIs, and explore predictors of the occurrence of irAEs.MethodsA prospective analysis was performed on older patients with lung cancer aged ≥ 65 years who were treated with anti-programmed cell death-1/-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors in Beijing Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. The incidence and risk factors of irAEs were estimated by the Chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The predictive power of Geriatric-8 (G-8) for irAEs was tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Lymphocyte counts were measured by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels were tested by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculated progression-free survival (PFS) curves, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences.ResultsA total of 201 older patients aged ≥ 65 years with lung cancer were enrolled in this study. The most common irAEs were interstitial pneumonia, dermatological toxicity and hypothyroidism, with rates of 17.2%, 16.1% and 5.6%, respectively. ROC showed that G-8 could predict the occurrence of irAEs in patients aged 65–71 years (≥ G2 irAEs: AUC = 0.757, p < 0.001; ≥ G3 irAEs: AUC = 0.862, p < 0.001), but not for patients aged ≥ 71 years. NLR, LMR, PNI, hypertension and diabetes were associated with irAEs. Lower CD4 + T cells and B cells, and lower levels of IL-10 were associated with the development of irAEs.ConclusionOur study confirmed the accuracy of G-8 for predicting irAEs in older patients. We also identified several predictors of irAEs in older patients with lung cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04792-1.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become an indispensable part of clinical practice; however, off-label use of these agents is unknown. We aimed to define the patterns of off-label use of ICIs in a nationwide sample of patients.MethodsThe online database (Reçetem) was retrospectively searched for off-label use cases related to ICIs approved during a 6-month period. Adult patients with metastatic solid tumors were included. Ethics approval was obtained. Reasons for off-label use were recorded in eight categories and cases were assessed for adherence to current guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed with GNU PSPP version 1.5.3.ResultsFive hundred seventy-seven reasons for use were recorded for 538 cases related to 527 patients (67.5% male). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (35.9%) was the most common cancer type. Nivolumab (49%), pembrolizumab (25.5%), and atezolizumab (25%) were commonly used. The top reason for off-label use was lack of approval for the cancer type (37.1%), followed by use beyond the approved treatment line (21%). Nivolumab was more frequently used than atezolizumab and/or pembrolizumab in patients with malignant melanoma, kidney cancer, head and neck cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, p < 0.001). The guideline adherence rate was 60.5%.ConclusionOff-label use of ICIs was primarily related to (NSCLC), and most patients were treatment-naïve in contrast to the acceptance that off-label use results from exhausted treatment options. Lack of approval is a significant reason for the off-label use of ICIs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04803-1.","PurposeDrug resistance inevitably occurs despite the encouraging results of immunotherapy. This study attempted to investigate immunotherapy rechallenge treatment regimens and factors associated with outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) according to resistance status.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted on patients with advanced NSCLC who received immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy and immune rechallenge between March 2016 and December 2022. Primary resistance (RR) was defined by an absence of response after treatment administered for less than 6 months before progression. Acquired resistance (AR) was defined as a response to immunotherapy treatment administered for more than 6 months before progression. Disease progression in as many as three lesions was defined as systemic progression, whereas disease progression in fewer than three lesions was defined as oligo-progression.ResultsOf 40 patients, 18 (45%) had primary resistance, and 22 (55%) developed AR. Overall survival (OS) was not reached. A significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was observed in individuals rechallenged with ICIs after AR and RR (7.0 months vs. 2.1 months, P = 0.003). Patients receiving interval treatment before rechallenge achieved longer PFS than those who did not (6.2 months vs. 4.0 months, P = 0.027). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that systemic progression was a risk factor significantly associated with PFS after ICI rechallenge (P = 0.006). After AR, ICI rechallenge prolonged the duration of PFS if patients developed oligo-progression (5.4 months vs. 1.1 months, P < 0.001).ConclusionICI rechallenge is likely to be an option for patients with oligo-progression during rechallenge, particularly after AR.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05490-8.",1
"BackgroundCancer stem cells (CSCs) were linked to cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MethodsWe integrated two external HCC cohorts to develop the stem cell subtypes according to unsupervised clustering with 26 stem cell gene sets. Between the subtypes, differences in prognosis, clinical characteristics, recognized HCC subtypes, metabolic profile, immune-related features, somatic mutation, and drug sensitivity were examined. The prognostic signature was created, and validated by numerous cohorts, and used to assess the efficacy of immunotherapy and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment. The nomogram was developed based on the signature and clinical features. We further examined the function of KIF20A in HCC and proved that KIF20A had the potential to regulate the stemness of HCC cells through western blot.ResultsLow stem cell patterns, a good prognosis, positive clinical features, specific molecular subtypes, low metastatic characteristics, and an abundance of metabolic and immunological aspects were associated with Cluster 1, whereas Cluster 2 was the reverse. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy were more effective in Cluster 1. Cluster 1 and CTNNB1 and ALB mutation were more closely. Additionally, the prognosis, immunotherapeutic, and TACE therapy responses were all worse in the high-risk group. The nomogram could predict the survival probability of HCC patients. KIF20A was discovered to be overexpressed in HCC and was revealed to be connected to the stemness of the HepG2 cell line.ConclusionsTwo stem cell subgroups with different prognoses, metabolic, and immunological characteristics in HCC patients were identified. We also created a 7-gene prognostic signature and a nomogram to estimate the survival probability. The function of KIF20A in HCC stemness was initially examined.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05239-3.","BackgroundT cells have been proven to play important roles in anti-tumor and tumor microenvironment shaping, while these roles have not been explained in bladder cancer (BLCA).MethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to screen T-cell marker genes. Bulk RNA-sequencing data and clinical information from BLCA patients were downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database to develop a prognosis signature. We analyzed the association of different risk groups with survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and immunotherapy response.ResultsBased on 192 T-cell marker genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis, we constructed a prognostic signature containing 7 genes in the training cohort, which was further validated in the testing cohort and GEO cohort. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 1-, 3-, and 5 years were 0.734, 0.742 and 0.726 in the training cohort, 0.697, 0.671 and 0.670 in the testing cohort, 0.702, 0.665 and 0.629 in the GEO cohort, respectively. In addition, we constructed a nomogram based on clinical factors and the risk score of the signature. The low-risk group exhibited higher immune-related pathways, immune cell infiltration and TMB levels. Importantly, immunophenotype score and immunotherapy cohort (IMvigor210) analyses showed that the low-risk group had better immunotherapy response and prognosis.ConclusionsOur study reveals a novel prognostic signature based on T-cell marker genes, which provides a new target and theoretical support for BLCA patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04881-1.",1
"AbstractIntroductionEven in the absence of inflammation, persistent symptoms in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) are prevalent and worsen quality of life. We previously demonstrated enrichment in sulfidogenic microbes in quiescent Crohn’s disease patients with (qCD + S) vs without persistent GI symptoms (qCD-S). Thus, we hypothesized that sulfur metabolic pathways would be enriched in stool while differentially abundant microbes would be associated with important sulfur metabolic pathways in qCD + S.MethodsWe performed a multicenter observational study nested within SPARC IBD. Quiescent inflammation was defined by fecal calprotectin level < 150 mcg/g. Persistent symptoms were defined by CD-PRO2. Active CD (aCD) and non-IBD diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) were included as controls.ResultsThirty-nine patients with qCD + S, 274 qCD-S, 21 aCD, and 40 IBS-D underwent paired shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic profiling. The fecal metabolome in qCD + S was significantly different relative to qCD-S and IBS-D but not aCD. Patients with qCD + S were enriched in sulfur-containing amino acid pathways, including cysteine and methionine, as well as serine, glycine, and threonine. Glutathione and nicotinate/nicotinamide pathways were also enriched in qCD + S relative to qCD-S, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction, a downstream target of H2S signaling. Multi-omic integration demonstrated that enriched microbes in qCD + S were associated with important sulfur metabolic pathways. Bacterial sulfur metabolic genes, including CTH, isfD, sarD, and asrC, were dysregulated in qCD + S. Finally, sulfur metabolites with and without sulfidogenic microbes showed good accuracy in predicting the presence of qCD + S.DiscussionMicrobial-derived sulfur pathways and downstream mitochondrial function are perturbed in qCD + S, which implicate H2S signaling in the pathogenesis of this condition. Future studies will determine whether targeting H2S pathways results in improved quality of life in qCD + S.","ABSTRACTPeople living with cancer have a profound need to understand any potential negative impacts of treatment on their everyday lives and whether the treatment itself could cause other long-term health challenges. This podcast brings together the perspectives of a patient, patient advocates and an oncologist, to highlight opportunities to better support people in understanding the possible side effects of a treatment and potential impact on quality of life. In addition to bridging gaps between the perspectives of healthcare providers and patients, it may be helpful to support people in interpreting relevant clinical trial findings. With this in mind, two accompanying visual guides use patient-friendly language to help people understand how safety and quality of life are measured in clinical trials.",1
"ABSTRACTOvarian cancer remains one of the main causes of human mortality, accounting for millions of deaths every year. Despite of several clinical options such as chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), hormonal treatment, radiation therapy, and surgery to manage this disease, the mortality rate is still very high. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for innovative approaches to improve both diagnosis and treatment. Success stories of iron oxide nanoparticles, that is Ferucarbotran (Resovist®) and Ferrixan (Cliavist®) for liver imaging, CNS (Central nervous system) imaging, cell labeling, etc. have motivated researchers to explore these nanocarriers for treatment and diagnosis of different diseases. Iron oxide nanoparticles have improved the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs through targeted delivery, heat/ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation on application of external energy and have also shown great potential as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their unique magnetic properties enable sensitive imaging, and surface modification allows the attachment of specific biomolecules for targeted detection of ovarian cancer cells. Their unique properties, viz. magnetic responsiveness and surface functionalization, make them versatile tools for enhancing both imaging and therapeutic outcomes. Present article reviews the literature on the synthesis, functionalization, and applications of iron oxide nanoparticles in management of ovarian cancer.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have prolonged the survival of patients with various carcinomas, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and have caused a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. Although programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells is a predictive marker of therapeutic efficacy, additional predictive markers are required. This study aimed to explore the role of immunological and nutritional parameters in the prediction of treatment response.MethodsPatients diagnosed with NSCLC and treated with pembrolizumab were examined retrospectively. Body weight was measured 4–6 weeks before the start of the first treatment, immediately before treatment, and 4–6 weeks after the start of the first treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start of pembrolizumab treatment to the last follow-up date or until disease progression. Statistical analyses were performed to confirm the association between various factors and association between these factors and PFS.ResultsThirty-eight patients with advanced NSCLC were included. We observed a significant association of weight loss and PD-L1 expression with PFS in the multivariate analysis. A significant correlation was found between the advanced lung cancer inflammation index and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. A weight loss of > 5% after the start of treatment was significantly associated with worse PFS.ConclusionsWeight loss is an important negative prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC receiving immunotherapy. Weight maintenance may be important for good ICI treatment efficacy, and future interventions in cancer cachexia are expected to further enhance the treatment efficacy of ICIs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03941-2.",0
"AbstractBackgroundRacial and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in gynecologic cancer clinical trials despite disproportionately worse oncologic outcomes. Research shows differential racial enrollment patterns because of comorbidity-based exclusion criteria. Our objective was to evaluate contemporary trends in comorbidity-based exclusion criteria among National Cancer Institute–sponsored gynecologic cancer clinical trials and protocol adherence to broadened eligibility criteria guidelines as an assessment of equitable enrollment access.MethodsThe ClinicalTrials.gov registry was queried for National Cancer Institute–sponsored gynecologic cancer clinical trials (1994-2021). Study characteristics and comorbidity-based exclusion criteria were abstracted from protocols. Descriptive statistics and temporal trends were calculated using χ2 testing with STATA v17 software.ResultsAmong 279 clinical trials identified, 65% completed enrollment, 53% were phase II, and 48% focused on ovarian cancer. Pharmaceutical agents (85%) were the primary therapeutic interventions. Several inequitably restrictive exclusion criteria increased over time such as hepatitis infection (17% in 1994-2000 vs 49% in 2015-2021, P < .001) and cardiovascular disease (47% in 1994-2000 vs 66% in 2015-2021, P = .002). A previously rare exclusion, “mental illness and/or social situations,” dramatically increased from 5% to 51% (P < .001) over 3 decades. Adherence to broadened eligibility criteria recommendations was mixed. Renal function, cardiovascular disease, and performance status criteria were not broadened, but HIV, prior or concurrent malignancies, and brain metastasis criteria were.ConclusionsSome, but not all, of the known restrictive comorbidity-based exclusion criteria have increased in gynecologic cancer clinical trial design, despite calls for improving racial and ethnic minority representation. Exclusion criteria are critical for trial safety, however, they must be carefully considered given the differential racial impact on eligibility.","In this retrospective study, MET inhibitor therapy demonstrated better survival outcomes compared with other treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Furthermore, MET ex14 skipping mutations and/or MET amplification typically occurred in the absence of other oncogenic driver mutations. With recent approvals of METi for patients with MET ex14 NSCLC, there is a need to identify more patients for treatment with METi to improve survival outcomes.Background:We evaluated the disease and patient characteristics, treatment, and MET testing patterns, predictive biomarkers and survival outcomes in patients with MET-dysregulated metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting.Patients and Methods:This was a multinational, retrospective, noninterventional chart review study. Data from medical records of patients with advanced/metastatic EGFR wild-type, MET-dysregulated NSCLC (December 2017-September 2018) were abstracted into electronic data collection forms.Results:Overall, 211 patient charts were included in this analysis; 157 patients had MET exon 14 skipping mutations (MET ex14; with or without concomitant MET amplification) and 54 had MET amplification only. All patients were tested for MET ex14, whereas MET amplification was evaluated in 168 patients. No overlap was reported between MET dysregulation and ALK, ROS1 or RET rearrangements, or HER2 exon 20 insertions. Overall, 56 of 211 patients (26.5%) received MET inhibitor (METi) therapy in any treatment-line setting (31.2% in the MET ex14 cohort; 13% in the MET-amplified only cohort). In the MET ex14 cohort, median OS in patients receiving METi was 25.4 months versus 10.7 months in patients who did not (HR [95% CI]: 0.532 [0.340–0.832]; P = .0055). In the MET-amplified only cohort, median OS was 20.6 months in patients treated with METi compared with 7.6 months in those without METi (HR [95% CI]: 0.388 [0.152–0.991]; P = .0479).Conclusions:MET alterations in NSCLC typically occur in the absence of other oncogenic driver mutations and are associated with poor survival outcomes. Notably, METi therapies are associated with improved survival outcomes in patients with MET-dysregulated NSCLC.",0
"ABSTRACTRegenerative therapy, a key area of tissue engineering, holds promise for restoring damaged organs, especially in bone regeneration. Bone healing is natural to the body but becomes complex under stress and disease. Large bone deformities pose significant challenges in tissue engineering. Among various methods, scaffolds are attractive as they provide structural support and essential nutrients for cell adhesion and growth. Collagen and hydroxyapatite (HA) are widely used due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Collagen and nano-scale HA enhance cell adhesion and development. Thus, nano HA/collagen scaffolds offer potential solutions for bone regeneration. This review focuses on the use and production of nano-sized HA/collagen composites in bone regeneration.","Adolescents are a growing population of people living with HIV. The period between weaning and sexual debut presents a low-risk window for HIV acquisition, making early childhood an ideal time for implementing an immunization regimen. Because the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is critical for an effective HIV vaccine, our goal was to assess the ability of a bnAb B cell lineage-designed HIV envelope SOSIP (protein stabilized by a disulfide bond between gp120-gp41—named “SOS”—and an isoleucine-to-proline point mutation—named “IP”—at residue 559) to induce precursor CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-targeting bnAbs in early life. Infant rhesus macaques received either a BG505 SOSIP, based on the infant BG505 transmitted/founder virus, or the CD4bs germ line-targeting BG505 SOSIP GT1.1 (n = 5 per group). Although both strategies induced durable, high-magnitude plasma autologous virus neutralization responses, only GT1.1-immunized infants (n = 3 of 5) exhibited VRC01-like CD4bs bnAb precursor development. Thus, a multidose immunization regimen with bnAb lineage-designed SOSIPs shows promise for inducing early B cell responses with the potential to mature into protective HIV bnAbs before sexual debut.",0
"AimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. Expression defects and turnover of basement membrane (BM) proteins are key pathogenic factors in cancer. It is still uncertain how the expression of BM-related genes (BMGs) in HCC relates to prognosis.MethodsAll of the HCC cohort's RNA-seq and clinical information came from TCGA datasets. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm was utilized to filter down the candidate genes and construct the prognostic model. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were run to examine if the risk score may serve as a standalone prognostic indicator. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was utilized to analyze examine immune cell infiltration and pathway activity.ResultsFive genes and their risk coefficients were eventually identified and patients with HCC were classified as either high or low risk based on the median of risk scores. Multivariate Cox regression analysis found a significant correlation between risk score and OS (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that BMGs signature had good prediction ability for HCC patients in age, gender, T stage, and AJCC stage (all p < 0.05). According to the ssGSEA, the high-risk subgroup showed higher levels of immune cell infiltration and immune-related pathways were more engaged in the high-risk group.ConclusionsOur research systematically built a prognostic model using risk score based on BMGs signature in HCC patients. The immune feature analysis of the BMGs signature indicated a potential regulation between tumor immunity and BM in HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04549-2.","BackgroundWith the update and release of the newest version of WHO classification  for neuroendocrine neoplasm, the clinical features, risk factors of prognosis and the effect of surgical treatment on newly classified pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (pNEC) patients with liver metastasis were not deeply analyzed. In the present study, we tried to reveal the clinical features, and prognostic factors of pNEC patients with liver metastasis with the newest definition of WHO 2019, and explore whether primary tumor resection (PTR), chemotherapy and radiotherapy affect overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in those patients.MethodsWe collected data from pNEC patients with liver metastasis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2019. We strictly selected pNEC patients according to the 2019 WHO classification criteria. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to determine independent predictors of the survival of these patients. The forest plots map was drawn by R-4.2.2 software to display the results of the multivariate analysis visually. Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the OS and CSS. Based on the multivariate analysis outcomes, we established the predictable nomogram model to predict the prognosis of pNEC patients with liver metastasis. The calibration plots were shown to prove the predictive value of the nomogram predictable model.ResultsWe identified 205 eligible pNEC patients with liver metastasis. According to the multivariable Cox regression analysis in this study, we found that PTR, chemotherapy, primary tumor size and diagnosis to treatment time were independent prognostic factors for both OS and CSS. Kaplan–Meier survival curves demonstrated that PTR and chemotherapy were correlated with increased survival for pNEC patients with liver metastasis. The accuracy of the nomogram model was visually proved by the calibration plot with acceptable predictive performance.ConclusionFour independent predictors of prognosis in pNEC patients with liver metastasis were identified in this study, including PTR, chemotherapy, tumor size and diagnosis to treatment time. PTR and chemotherapy for pNEC with liver metastasis could lead to a better prognosis, which may provide inspiration for practical clinical guidelines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04847-3.",0
"The differential diagnosis for multiple intracranial lesions in a young adult is broad and includes demyelinating, neoplastic, and infectious etiologies. In this report, we describe the case of a 19-year-old immunocompetent woman presenting with progressive headaches and aphasia. MRI of the brain revealed multiple, large supratentorial lesions with concentric bands of alternating T2 signal intensities and peripheral contrast enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was overall bland with negative oligoclonal bands. Serum antibody testing for neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and myelin-oligodendrocyte associated disease (MOGAD) were negative. A broad infectious work-up was also unrevealing. A definitive diagnosis was ultimately obtained after brain biopsy and the patient was started on appropriate therapy. This case highlights a diagnostic framework in evaluating immunocompetent patients presenting with multiple intracranial lesions and progressive neurological decline. The main differential diagnoses for this constellation of radiological and clinical findings are discussed and a literature review is performed on the revealed diagnosis. Lastly, both acute and long-term therapeutic approaches are reviewed.","AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.",0
"PurposeThe aim of the study was to construct a risk score model based on m6A-related targets to predict overall survival and immunotherapy response in ovarian cancer.MethodsThe gene expression profiles of 24 m6A regulators were extracted. Survival analysis screened 9 prognostic m6A regulators. Next, consensus clustering analysis was applied to identify clusters of ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, 47 phenotype-related differentially expressed genes, strongly correlated with 9 prognostic m6A regulators, were screened and subjected to univariate and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. Ultimately, a nomogram was constructed which presented a strong ability to predict overall survival in ovarian cancer.ResultsCBLL1, FTO, HNRNPC, METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, ZC3H13, RBM15B and YTHDC2 were associated with worse overall survival (OS) in ovarian cancer. Three m6A clusters were identified, which were highly consistent with the three immune phenotypes. What is more, a risk model based on seven m6A-related targets was constructed with distinct prognosis. In addition, the low-risk group is the best candidate population for immunotherapy.ConclusionWe comprehensively analyzed the m6A modification landscape of ovarian cancer and detected seven m6A-related targets as an independent prognostic biomarker for predicting survival. Furthermore, we divided patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct prognosis and select the optimum population which may benefit from immunotherapy and constructed a nomogram to precisely predict ovarian cancer patients’ survival time and visualize the prediction results.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04162-3.","Innate immunity, cell death and inflammation underpin many aspects of health and disease. Upon sensing pathogens, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or alarmins, the innate immune system activates inflammatory cell death, such as pyroptosis and PANoptosis. These genetically-defined, regulated cell death pathways not only contribute to the host defense against infectious disease, but also promote pathological manifestations leading to cancer and inflammatory diseases. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms has grown rapidly in recent years. However, how dying cells, cell corpses, and their liberated cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory signalling molecules are further sensed by innate immune cells, and their contribution to further amplify inflammation, trigger antigen presentation, and activate adaptive immunity, is less clear. Here, we discuss how pattern-recognition and PANoptosome sensors in innate immune cells recognize and respond to cell-death signatures. We also highlight molecular targets of the innate immune response for potential therapeutic development.",0
"BackgroundCutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) has the worst prognosis among skin cancers, especially metastatic CMM. Predicting its prognosis accurately could direct clinical decisions.MethodsThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was screened to collect CMM patients’ data. According to diagnosed time, patients were subdivided into three cohorts, train cohort (diagnosed between 2010 and 2013), validation cohort (diagnosed in 2014), and test cohort (diagnosed in 2015). Train cohort was used to train deep learning survival model for cutaneous malignant melanoma (DeepCMM). DeepCMM was then evaluated in train cohort and validation cohort internally, and validated in test cohort externally.ResultsDeepCMM showed 0.8270 (95% CI, confidence interval, CI 0.8260–0.8280) as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in train cohort, 0.8274 (95% CI 0.8286–0.8298) AUC in validation cohort, and 0.8303 (95% CI 0.8289–0.8316) AUC in test cohort. Then DeepCMM was packaged into a Windows 64-bit software for doctors to use.ConclusionDeep learning survival model for cutaneous malignant melanoma (DeepCMM) can offer a reliable prediction on cutaneous malignant melanoma patients’ overall survival.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05421-7.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in India. This review explores the epidemiological trends and the landscape of systemic therapy for HCC in the Indian context, acknowledging the recent shift in etiology from viral hepatitis to lifestyle-associated factors.A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, including data from the Global Cancer Observatory and the Indian Council of Medical Research, along with a critical analysis of various clinical trials. The article investigates systemic therapies in-depth, discussing their mechanisms, efficacy, and adaptation to Indian healthcare framework.Progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of ≤0.6 compared to sorafenib, overall survival of ∼16–19 months, and objective response rate of 20–30% are the defining thresholds for systemic therapy clinical trials. Systemic therapy for advanced HCC in India primarily involves the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, and cabozantinib, with sorafenib being the most commonly used drug for a long time. Monoclonal antibodies such as ramucirumab and bevacizumab and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, are expanding treatment horizons. Lenvatinib has emerged as a cost-effective alternative, and the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. Despite these advances, late-stage diagnosis and limited healthcare accessibility pose significant challenges, often relegating patients to palliative care.Addressing HCC in India demands an integrative approach that not only encompasses advancements in systemic therapy but also targets early detection and comprehensive care models. Future strategies should focus on enhancing awareness, screening for high-risk populations, and overcoming infrastructural disparities. Ensuring the judicious use of systemic therapies within the constraints of the Indian healthcare economy is crucial. Ultimately, a nuanced understanding of systemic therapeutic options and their optimal utilization will be pivotal in elevating the standard of HCC care in India.",0
"Aging is a complex and universal process marked by gradual functional declines at the cellular and tissue levels, often leading to a range of aging-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Delaying the aging process can help prevent, slow down, and alleviate the severity of these various conditions, enhancing overall health and well-being. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are a class of widely used antidiabetic drugs that inhibit alpha-glucosidase in the small intestinal mucosa, delaying carbohydrate absorption and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. Beyond their roles in diabetes treatment, AGIs have shown potential in extending lifespan and effectively treating aging-related diseases by modulating oxidative stress, gut microbiota, inflammatory responses, and nutrient-sensing pathways. This review summarizes recent advancements in the application of AGIs for preventing and treating aging and aging-related diseases, with a focus on their mechanisms and roles in these processes.","Aim: Wilms’ tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP), plays a part in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, it is not yet known how WTAP affects cancer progression by influencing leukocyte rich repeat containing proteins (NLR) – family members 3 (NLRP3) – related inflammasomes.Materials & methods: We first validated the expression of WTAP in CRC at the tissue and cellular levels. Subsequently, by transfecting si-NC and si-WTAP into cells, we verified functions of WTAP in proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of CRC cells. Finally, we analyzed the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of NLRP3 by WTAP using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR technology, confirming that WTAP mediated the repression of NLRP3 inflammasome and the malignant progression of tumor cells.Results: WTAP was substantially upregulated in CRC tissues and cells. WTAP reinforced the migration, proliferation and invasion ability of CRC cells, and repressed apoptosis. Mechanistically, WTAP mediated the m6A modification of NLRP3, which suppressed the expression of NLRP3 and dampened the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis activation as well as pyroptosis, thereby facilitating the malignant progression of CRC.Conclusion: WTAP mediates m6A modification to modulate the repression of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis in pyroptosis, reinforcing the malignant progression of CRC.",0
"IntroductionGround glass opacity featured lung adenocarcinomas (GGO-LUAD) display more indolent biological behavior than solid nodule featured lung adenocarcinomas (SN-LUAD) and have an excellent prognosis. However, the cellular immune characteristics of GGO-LUAD remain poorly understood.MethodsImmunohistochemistry technique was performed to stain related immune markers (CD8, CD103, CD20, CD138, CD4, FOXP3, CD68, CD163, PD-1 and PD-L1) and TGF-β from 15 patients with pure GGO-LUAD and 15 patients with SN-LUAD tissue sections (Paired cohort), and then, the related markers with significant differences were verified on 10 patients (Verified cohort) with both pure GGO-LUAD and SN-LUAD. For localization analysis of CD68 + tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and FOXP3 + Terg cells in tumor areas, pure GGO-LUAD and SN-LUAD were also stained for simultaneous detection of pan-CK, CD68 and FOXP3 by multiplex immunofluorescence.ResultsIn the Paired cohort, compared with SN-LUAD, only the infiltration of TAMs and Treg cells was significantly lower in GGO-LUAD. The infiltration of the remaining immune cells including CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, CD103 + T cells, CD20 + B cells and CD138 + Plasma cells in GGO-LUAD, although relatively low, was not significantly different. Meanwhile, the expression of TGF-β was significantly higher in SN-LUAD. And the above results have also been confirmed in the Verified cohort. Moreover, there was no significantly difference in PD-L1 expression in GGO-LUAD compared to SN-LUAD both in the Paired cohort and Verified cohort.ConclusionsGGO-LUAD demonstrates an overall less active immune landscape as compared with SN-LUAD. TAMs and TGF-β may play an important role in the progression of GGO-LUAD. More importantly, PD-L1 expression in GGO-LUAD is comparable to that in SN-LUAD, indicating that there may be other reasons for the insensitivity of GGO-LUAD to immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04289-3.","AbstractInvasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) of lung is a unique subset of adenocarcinomas characterized by an intrapulmonary aerogenous spread resulting in multicentric, multilobar, and bilateral lesions with a low frequency of distant metastasis. The treatment options for IMA are limited, and advanced IMA has a poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than a year. Lung transplantation performed in a handful of selected patients showed improved survival outcomes and clinical improvement. However, high postoperative recurrence rates have been observed and recurrence appeared to originate from the primary tumor in many cases. Techniques, such as non-sequential double lung transplantation utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass, have been performed to reduce recurrence. Here, we present the first case of bilateral lung transplantation employing cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient with stage ⅣA lung-limited IMA without lymph node or distant metastasis. At 15 months post-transplantation, the patient remains stable with no evidence of disease recurrence or organ rejection. Additionally, we describe the classification, clinical outcomes, protein expression, and genetic characteristics of IMA. IMA was previously classified as a subset of bronchioalveolar carcinoma (BAC), which is invasive and mucinous with goblet or columnar cells secreting mucin. We reviewed and summarized the lung transplantation cases reported to date for BAC. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival have been reported approximately 50% (range, 39-100) and 50% (range, 35–100), respectively. The literature shows these outcomes are comparable to bilateral lung transplantation performed for non-cancerous pulmonary disease.",0
"PurposeEwing sarcoma (ES) is one of the most common malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents. The immune microenvironment plays an important role in the development of ES. Here, we developed an optimal signature for determining ES patient prognosis based on immune-related genes (IRGs).MethodsWe analyzed the ES gene expression profile dataset, GSE17679, from the GEO database and extracted differential expressed IRGs (DEIRGs). Then, we conducted functional correlation and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses of the DEIRGs and used the machine learning algorithm-iterative Lasso Cox regression analysis to build an optimal DEIRG signature. In addition, we applied ES samples from the ICGC database to test the optimal gene signature. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regressions on clinicopathological characteristics and optimal gene signature to evaluate whether signature is an important prognostic factor. Finally, we calculated the infiltration of 24 immune cells in ES using the ssGSEA algorithm, and analyzed the correlation between the DEIRGs in the optimal gene signature and immune cells.ResultsA total of 249 DEIRGs were screened and an 11-gene signature with the strongest correlation with patient prognoses was analyzed using a machine learning algorithm. The 11-gene signature also had a high prognostic value in the ES external verification set. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that 11-gene signature is an independent prognostic factor. We found that macrophages and cytotoxic, CD8 T, NK, mast, B, NK CD56bright, TEM, TCM, and Th2 cells were significantly related to patient prognoses; the infiltration of cytotoxic and CD8 T cells in ES was significantly different. By correlating prognostic biomarkers with immune cell infiltration, we found that FABP4 and macrophages, and NDRG1 and Th2 cells had the strongest correlation.ConclusionOverall, the IRG-related 11-gene signature can be used as a reliable ES prognostic biomarker and can provide guidance for personalized ES therapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03396-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeTo explore interpretable machine learning (ML) methods, with the hope of adding more prognosis value, for predicting survival for patients with Oropharyngeal-Cancer (OPC).MethodsA cohort of 427 OPC patients (Training 341, Test 86) from TCIA database was analyzed. Radiomic features of gross-tumor-volume (GTV) extracted from planning CT using Pyradiomics, and HPV p16 status, etc. patient characteristics were considered as potential predictors. A multi-level dimension reduction algorithm consisting of Least-Absolute-Selection-Operator (Lasso) and Sequential-Floating-Backward-Selection (SFBS) was proposed to effectively remove redundant/irrelevant features. The interpretable model was constructed by quantifying the contribution of each feature to the Extreme-Gradient-Boosting (XGBoost) decision by Shapley-Additive-exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm.ResultsThe Lasso-SFBS algorithm proposed in this study finally selected 14 features, and our prediction model achieved an area-under-ROC-curve (AUC) of 0.85 on the test dataset based on this feature set. The ranking of the contribution values calculated by SHAP shows that the top predictors that were most correlated with survival were ECOG performance status, wavelet-LLH_firstorder_Mean, chemotherapy, wavelet-LHL_glcm_InverseVariance, tumor size. Those patients who had chemotherapy, with positive HPV p16 status, and lower ECOG performance status, tended to have higher SHAP scores and longer survival; who had an older age at diagnosis, heavy drinking and smoking pack year history, tended to lower SHAP scores and shorter survival.ConclusionWe demonstrated predictive values of combined patient characteristics and imaging features for the overall survival of OPC patients. The multi-level dimension reduction algorithm can reliably identify the most plausible predictors that are mostly associated with overall survival. The interpretable patient-specific survival prediction model, capturing correlations of each predictor and clinical outcome, was developed to facilitate clinical decision-making for personalized treatment.",1
"ObjectivesThe aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with recurrent and metastatic sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and evaluate the current treatment strategies to help guide future management.DesignThis is a retrospective cohort study.SettingThe study was conducted at six international tertiary treatment centers.ParticipantsPatients with documented diagnoses of recurrent or metastatic SNUC since 1983 were included in the study.Main Outcome MeasuresPatient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected. Primary outcome measures included disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), and time to recurrence (TTR) following initial treatment. Further univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess for prognostic factors.Results A total of 97 patients with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 52.4 (15.6) were identified, 15 of whom presented with metastatic SNUC and 90 of whom developed recurrence. Management in both populations was widely variable. For patients with metastatic disease, the 1-year DSS probability was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8–100%). For patients with recurrent SNUC, the 1- and 5-year DSS probabilities were 45.7% (95% CI, 31.9–65.6%) and 8.6% (95% CI, 2.9–25.3%), respectively. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) TTR was 8 months (3–18.5 months). Multivariable analyses revealed a significant association between orbital involvement on initial presentation and TTR (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.28; 95% CI, 1.45–7.42; p = 0.004). ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study addressing metastatic and recurrent SNUC based on a large patient cohort. Orbital extension of the primary SNUC may predict a higher probability of recurrence following treatment, suggesting the possible utility of a more aggressive treatment in this subgroup of patients. A heterogenous patient population and wide variability in management emphasize the challenges in standardizing care; however, dismal survival rates demonstrate the necessity for further evaluation of current approaches to improve evidence-based recommendations.","BackgroundCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an essential component of the tumor immune microenvironment that are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We aim to investigate the characteristics of CAFs in prostate cancer and develop a biochemical recurrence (BCR)-related CAF signature for predicting the prognosis of PCa patients.MethodsThe bulk RNA-seq and relevant clinical information were obtained from the TCGA and GEO databases, respectively. The infiltration scores of CAFs in prostate cancer patients were calculated using the MCP counter and EPIC algorithms. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was downloaded from the GEO database. Subsequently, univariate Cox regression analysis was employed to identify prognostic genes associated with CAFs. We identified two subtypes (C1 and C2) of prostate cancer that were associated with CAFs via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. In addition, the BCR-related CAF signatures were constructed using Lasso regression analysis. Finally, a nomogram model was established based on the risk score and clinical characteristics of the patients.ResultsInitially, we found that patients with high CAF infiltration scores had shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) times. Subsequently, CAFs in four pairs of tumors and paracancerous tissues were identified. We discovered 253 significantly differentially expressed genes, of which 13 had prognostic significance. Using NMF clustering, we divided PCa patients into C1 and C2 subgroups, with the C1 subgroup having a worse prognosis and substantially enriched cell cycle, homologous recombination, and mismatch repair pathways. Furthermore, a BCR-related CAFs signature was established. Multivariate COX regression analysis confirmed that the BCR-related CAFs signature was an independent prognostic factor for BCR in PCa. In addition, the nomogram was based on the clinical characteristics and risk scores of the patient and demonstrated high accuracy and reliability for predicting BCR. Lastly, our findings indicate that the risk score may be a useful tool for predicting PCa patients’ sensitivity to immunotherapy and drug treatment.ConclusionNMF clustering based on CAF-related genes revealed distinct TME immune characteristics between groups. The BCR-related CAF signature accurately predicted prognosis and immunotherapy response in prostate cancer patients, offering a promising new approach to cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05011-7.",0
"With advances in high-throughput technology, molecular disease subtyping by high-dimensional omics data has been recognized as an effective approach for identifying subtypes of complex diseases with distinct disease mechanisms and prognoses. Conventional cluster analysis takes omics data as input and generates patient clusters with similar gene expression pattern. The omics data, however, usually contain multi-faceted cluster structures that can be defined by different sets of gene. If the gene set associated with irrelevant clinical variables (for example, sex or age) dominates the clustering process, the resulting clusters may not capture clinically meaningful disease subtypes. This motivates the development of a clustering framework with guidance from a pre-specified disease outcome, such as lung function measurement or survival, in this paper. We propose two disease subtyping methods by omics data with outcome guidance using a generative model or a weighted joint likelihood. Both methods connect an outcome association model and a disease subtyping model by a latent variable of cluster labels. Compared to the generative model, weighted joint likelihood contains a data-driven weight parameter to balance the likelihood contributions from outcome association and gene cluster separation, which improves generalizability in independent validation but requires heavier computing. Extensive simulations and two real applications in lung disease and triple-negative breast cancer demonstrate superior disease subtyping performance of the outcome-guided clustering methods in terms of disease subtyping accuracy, gene selection and outcome association. Unlike existing clustering methods, the outcome-guided disease subtyping framework creates a new precision medicine paradigm to directly identify patient subgroups with clinical association.","PurposeThe prognosis of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma is rather poor. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have revolutionized anti-tumor therapy, especially for melanoma. In this study, we retrospectively summarized the real-world experience of systematic treatment for NRAS-mutant melanoma patients in this new era.Patients and methodsThe respective cohort included NRAS-mutant melanoma patients with metastatic or unresectable disease of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) from January 2018 to July 2022. The data about the clinical features and impact for systemic therapy of NRAS-mutant patients were collected and analyzed.ResultsAt data cutoff, 44 patients (19, 11, and 14 for acral, cutaneous, and mucosal ones, respectively) with NRAS-mutant were assessed. In addition, the median time of follow-up was 22.0 months. The immunotherapy-based combined treatment not only significantly improved the progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.006, HR 0.322), but was also accompanied by a higher objective response rate (ORR) (18.2%), disease control rate (DCR) (72.7%) than those of cytotoxic therapy or immunotherapy alone for advanced patients as first-line treatment. Nab-paclitaxel combined with anti-PD-1 inhibitor tended to produce better clinical benefit for the first-line treatment, especially for patients with acral melanoma. In addition, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) combined with anti-PD-1 inhibitor also seemed to provide longer duration of response (DOR) for some patients. But combined therapy did not prolong the overall survival (OS) of NRAS-mutant patients. The combined therapy was well tolerated. Most adverse events were moderate and controllable.ConclusionIn conclusion, PD-1 inhibitor-based combined therapy increased clinical benefit for advanced patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma.",0
"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment that kills cancer cells selectively by stimulating reactive oxygen species generation with photosensitizers exposed to specific light wavelengths. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a widely used photosensitizer. However, its limited tumour penetration and targeting reduce its therapeutic efficacy. Scholars have investigated nano-delivery techniques to improve 5-ALA administration and efficacy in PDT. This review summarises recent advances in biological host biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms for 5-ALA production. The review also highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of various 5-ALA nano-delivery modalities, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and gels, in treating various cancers. Although promising, 5-ALA nano-delivery methods face challenges that could impair targeting and efficacy. To determine their safety and biocompatibility, extensive preclinical and clinical studies are required. This study highlights the potential of 5-ALA-NDSs to improve PDT for cancer treatment, as well as the need for additional research to overcome barriers and improve medical outcomes.Graphical abstract","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies with a dismal survival rate. Few strategies can effectively prevent the occurrence of HCC. Although immunotherapy has significantly improved HCC-related survival in recent years, this systemic therapy is very expensive and lays a heavy burden on most HCC patients. Aspirin, which is currently one of the most widely used medications in analgesic and cardiovascular diseases, is reported to have anti-tumor effects on HCC. Most importantly, long-term administration of low-dose aspirin does not significantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Owing to its cost-effectiveness and wide use, aspirin can be easily applied as an HCC treatment and is affordable for a wide range of patients. Therefore, deeper understanding and more attention are needed to extend the frontline of aspirin's preventive and therapeutic potential into cancer research and management. In this review, we discuss the preventive effect of aspirin on HCC in the context of different etiological factors, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcohol-associated liver disease. The therapeutic role of aspirin in resectable or unresectable HCC management is also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of aspirin on HCC are fully reviewed and discussed in the following two aspects: the effect of aspirin on multi-oncogenic signaling pathways in HCC (for example, AMPK, Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB) and aspirin-mediated immunometabolic responses in liver diseases. These findings indicate aspirin is a promising agent for populations at risk and HCC patients to prevent or treat HCC.",1
"Recombinant human type 5 adenovirus (H101) is an oncolytic virus used to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Owing to the deletion of the E1B-55kD and E3 regions, H101 is believed to selectively inhibit nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Whether H101 inhibits other type of tumors via different mechanisms remains unclear. In this study we investigated the effects of H101 on melanomas. We established B16F10 melanoma xenograft mouse model, and treated the mice with H101 (1 × 108 TCID50) via intratumoral injection for five consecutive days. We found that H101 treatment significantly inhibited B16F10 melanoma growth in the mice. H101 treatment significantly increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and reduced the proportion of M2-type macrophages. We demonstrated that H101 exhibited low cytotoxicity against B16F10 cells, but the endothelial cells were more sensitive to H101 treatment. H101 induced endothelial cell pyroptosis in a caspase-1/GSDMD-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of H101 with the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 antibody (10 mg/kg, i.p., every three days for three times) exerted synergic suppression on B16F10 tumor growth in the mice. This study demonstrates that, in addition to oncolysis, H101 inhibits melanoma growth by promoting anti-tumor immunity and inducing pyroptosis of vascular endothelial cells.","Background:To improve patient selection for sentinel node (SN) biopsy, the Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA) created a predictive model based on readily available clinicopathologic factors.Objectives:Validation of the MIA nomogram using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), a nationwide oncology outcomes database for >1500 Commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States.Methods:A total of 60,165 patients were included in the validation. The probability of SN positivity was calculated for each patient. Using calculated probabilities, a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to assess the model’s discrimination ability.Results:At baseline, the NCDB cohort had different clinicopathologic characteristics compared with the original MIA data set. Despite these differences, the MIA nomogram retained high-predictive accuracy within the NCDB dataset (C-statistic, 0.733 [95% CI, 0.726–0.739]), although calibration weakened for the highest risk decile.Limitations:The NCDB collects data from hospital registries accredited by the Commission on Cancer.Conclusions:In conclusion, this study validated the use of the MIA nomogram in a nationwide oncology outcomes database collected from >1500 Commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States, demonstrating the potential for this nomogram to predict SN positivity and reduce the number of negative SN biopsies.",1
"The following case describes a constellation of progressive cognitive and motor deficits in a 73-year-old man with cirrhosis and history of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma confined to his liver. He had deficits in calculation, language, and writing, as well as subtle right-sided weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated non-enhancing white matter lesions without mass effect in the bilateral parietal and left occipitotemporal regions, correlating with neurologic exam findings. The patient’s basic blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were within normal limits. Our differential included inflammatory and demyelinating conditions, hepatic encephalopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. He did not improve with an empiric course of high-dose steroids or adequate hepatic encephalopathy treatment. A repeat lumbar puncture sent for additional CSF studies revealed a positive John Cunningham (JC) virus PCR test, confirming diagnosis of PML. Although the patient did not have any known overt immunosuppressive condition or treatment, the patient’s cirrhosis and age placed him at higher risk for developing JC virus CNS reactivation. In a published case series of patients with PML and no classic immunosuppressive condition that includes several patients with concomitant cirrhosis, prognosis is much worse compared to those with known, reversible causes of immunosuppression.","BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare solid malignancy with a poor prognosis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in tumorigenesis and progression. However, little is known about the role of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC.Methodsm6A-related lncRNAs were extracted by Pearson analysis, and then prognosis-related lncRNAs were filtered from the m6A-related lncRNAs by univariate Cox regression analysis. Based on the expression patterns of the prognosis-related lncRNAs, samples were classified into distinct clusters. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used to construct a m6A-lncRNA-related prognostic signature for PC patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate the prognostic ability of the model.ResultsA total of 178 tumor and 4 normal samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database in our study. Based on the expression of 12 filtered prognosis-related lncRNAs, two distinct clusters were eventually identified; these clusters were characterized by differences in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and prognosis. A risk model comprising ten m6A-related lncRNAs was identified as an independent predictor of prognosis. ROC analysis revealed that this model had an acceptable prognostic value for PC patients. The prognostic signature was related to the TIME and the expression of critical immune checkpoint molecules.ConclusionThis study comprehensively assessed the expression pattern and prognostic value of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC. The different clusters correlated with distinct TIMEs and prognoses. The study also constructed a ten-gene signature prognostic model based on m6A-related lncRNAs, which showed good accuracy in predicting overall survival.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03985-4.",0
"Introduction/ObjectiveThe spread of tumors (48% in men and 51% in women), as well as the protection of malignant tumors by stromal cells and complex blood vessels, pose significant challenges to drug delivery to tumors. Modern chemotherapy, on the other hand, addresses tumor growth suppression by at least 60% through versatile formulation systems and numerous modifications to drug delivery systems. The renewable and naturally occurring polymers present invariably in all living cells form the fundamental foundation for most anticancer drug development. The review aims to discuss in detail the preparations of polysaccharide, lipid, and protein-based drug-loading vehicles for the targeted delivery of prominent anticancer drugs. It also provides an explanation of drug distribution in blood (cumulative releases of nearly 80% drug) and drug accumulation at tumor sites (1–5 mg/kg) due to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR).MethodsSpecific delivery examples for treating colorectal and breast carcinomas have been presented to distinguish the varied drug administration, bioavailability, and tumor internalization mechanisms between sugar, fatty acid, and amino acid polymers. Current therapy possibilities based on cutting-edge literature are provided, along with drug delivery systems tailored to tumor location and invasive properties.ResultsThe unique combinations of the three natural polymers provide unparalleled solutions to minimize the toxicity (<20% drug release) of the chemotherapeutic drugs on normal tissues. Moreover, the development of a consolidated drug delivery system has contributed to a substantial reduction (dose reduction from 10.43 µM to 1.9 µM) in the undesirable consequences of higher dosages of chemotherapeutic drugs.ConclusionThe review extensively covers safe chemotherapeutic systems with significant advantages (tumor volume shrinkage of 4T1 cells from 1000 mm3 to 200 mm3) in clinical applications of carcinoma treatments using natural polymers.","PurposeCuproptosis, a novel programmed cell death, plays an important role in glioma growth, angiogenesis, and immune response. Nonetheless, the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the prognosis and tumor microenvironment (TME) of gliomas remains unknown.MethodsBy non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering, 1286 glioma patients were classified based on the mRNA expression levels of 27 CRGs and investigated the association of immune infiltration and clinical characteristics with cuproptosis subtypes. A CRG-score system was constructed using LASSO and multivariate Cox regression methods and validated in independent cohorts to predict the prognosis of glioma patients.ResultsGlioma patients were divided into two cuproptosis subtypes. Cluster C2 was enriched in immune-related pathways, had higher macrophage M2, neutrophils, and CD8 + T cells, and poorer prognosis compared with cluster C1 which was enriched in metabolism-related pathways. We further constructed and validated the ten-gene CRG risk scores. Glioma patients in the high CRG-score group had higher tumor mutation burden, higher TME scores, and poorer prognoses compared with the low CRG-score group. Additionally, the AUC value of the CRG-score was 0.778 in predicting the prognosis of gliomas. WHO grading, IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT methylation were significant differences between high and low CRG-score groups.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that CRG-score was related to immune cell infiltration and could accurately predict gliomas’ prognosis. Our findings may provide a novel understanding of the potential role of cuproptosis molecular pattern and TME in the immune response and prognosis of glioma patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05021-5.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are of great success in cancer therapy. This study aimed to identify adrenal insufficiency (AI) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment in cancer patients receiving steroid replacement therapy and report the clinical characteristics of ICI-associated AI and concurrent immune-associated adverse events (irAEs).MethodsPatients prescribed cortisone acetate between January 2020 and March 2022 were reviewed to identify AI associated with ICI treatment. Data collected included indication of ICI (cancer type), drug characteristics, and outcomes.ResultsA total of 101 patients were diagnosed with AI following treatment with ICIs. The median age was 64 years (range 22-83 years); 73.3% of the patients were male. Median time to develop primary AI and secondary AI after starting ICI therapy was 200.5 (35-280) days and 178 (16-562) days, respectively. Concurrent irAEs occurred in 67 (66.3%) patients and included 63 (62.4%) endocrine irAEs. Log-rank test showed that there was a trend toward higher likelihood of death at 120-day follow-up in patients initially receiving intravenous hydrocortisone compared with those receiving oral cortisone acetate after diagnosis of AI (p = 0.029).ConclusionThis retrospective study comprehensively documented the clinical characterization of ICI-associated AI. Those initially receiving intravenous hydrocortisone after diagnosis of AI were associated with higher likelihood of death. Physicians should be aware of the variability of ICI-associated irAEs early in the treatment, early diagnoses, and timely management should be made.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world and is one of the leading indications for liver transplantation, liver transplantation is the gold standard treatment for end stage liver disease. Diagnosis is based up on radiological characteristics and rarely biopsy results. However treatment must be individualized to each patient to improve recurrences and outcomes. In this article, we focus on the different selection criteria for liver transplantation. This study aimed to investigate the distribution laws and research frontiers of international literature, so as to present holistic bibliometric evaluation of the studies on 5-year survival and disease-free recurrence in 5 years, according to hepatocarcinoma criteria for liver transplantation. The paper aims to review and analyze 5-year survival and disease-free recurrence based on hepatocarcinoma criteria for liver transplantation. It systematically examines and summarizes distribution characteristics and research frontiers through bibliometric analysis. A bibliographic search was implemented in PubMed/Medline, Clinical Key, Science Direct and Index Medicus with MESH terms, from the year 1996–2022. Patients selected for transplantation using the Metroticket 2.0 (MT2) criteria had the highest overall survival along with patients selected for transplantation using the Milan Criteria had the best 5-year disease-free recurrence. The Metroticket 2.0 criteria (MT2) and Milan Criteria (MC) have shown the most favorable post-transplant outcomes for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, MC demonstrated the best 5-year disease-free recurrence rate, underscoring the significance of taking into account tumor morphology and biology when determining the eligibility of HCC patients for liver transplantation. The distribution characteristics and research frontiers by bibliometrics concerning prognostic role of selection criteria for liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma the collaborations are sufficient to reach a consensus that the Milan criteria are the best criteria.",1
"AbstractBackgroundPreclinical cancer studies ascribe promising anticancer properties to metformin. Yet, clinical findings vary, casting uncertainty on its therapeutic value for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We hypothesized that metformin could benefit obese and overweight patients with NSCLC.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 2 clinical cohorts and employed complementary mouse models to test our hypothesis. One cohort included NSCLC patients with overweight body mass index (≥25 kg/m2, n = 511) and nonoverweight body mass index (<25 kg/m2, n = 232) who underwent lobectomy, evaluating metformin’s impact on clinical outcomes. Another cohort examined metformin’s effect on progression-free survival after immune checkpoint inhibitors in overweight (n = 284) vs nonoverweight (n = 184) NSCLC patients. Metformin’s effects on tumor progression, antitumor immunity, and immune checkpoint inhibitor response in obese and normal-weight mice were assessed with lung cancer models.ResultsMetformin is associated with increased recurrence-free survival in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.94; P = .035) after lobectomy. It also corrected accelerated tumor growth in diet-induced obese mouse models in a lymphocyte-specific manner while reversing several mechanisms of immune suppression potentiated by obesity. Programmed cell death 1 blockade coupled with metformin was more effective at limiting tumor burden in obese mice and correlated with progression-free survival only in overweight patients on immunotherapy (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.93; P = .024).ConclusionsMetformin may improve lung cancer–specific clinical outcomes in obese and overweight lung cancer patients and enhance immunotherapy efficacy in this growing population. This work identifies obesity as a potential predictive biomarker of metformin’s anticancer and immunotherapy-enhancing properties in lung cancer while shedding light on the underlying immunological phenomena.","AbstractBackgroundBiliary tract cancer (BTC) is an aggressive biliary tract cancer, arising from the bile ducts and gallbladder, with a poor prognosis. The TOPAZ-1 trial of durvalumab plus first-line chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) showed improved survival vs chemotherapy alone. This real-world study aimed to confirm the effectiveness of this regimen.MethodsThis retrospective, multicenter study included patients with advanced BTC treated with first-line durvalumab plus platinum chemotherapy at the Linkou, Taoyuan, and Tucheng branches of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital as well as at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between August 2021 and June 2023.ResultsAmong the 45 patients with advanced biliary tree cancer treated with durvalumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine as first-line treatment, the objective response rate was 31.1% (14 partial responses). An additional 40% (18 patients) had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95%CI, 4.4-6.9) and median overall survival was 15.8 months (95%CI, 7.9-23.8). Responders had significantly longer survival than non-responders (15.8 vs 3.3 months). Although higher durvalumab doses (1000-1500 mg) appeared to have improved efficacy compared to lower doses (<1000 mg), the difference was not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, poor ECOG performance status (≥2) and a high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio were independent prognostic factors for shorter overall survival.ConclusionThis real-world study demonstrated the comparable efficacy of durvalumab plus chemotherapy to the TOPAZ-1 trial for patients with advanced BTC and identified prognostic factors. There was a trend toward improved efficacy with higher durvalumab dosing (1000-1500 mg) vs lower dosing, though further research is needed to confirm this relationship.",0
"With expansion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and broader utilization of anti-cytokine directed therapeutics for toxicity mitigation, the routine assessment of cytokines may enhance understanding of toxicity profiles, guide therapeutic interventions, and facilitate cross-trial comparisons. As specific cytokine elevations can correlate with and provide insights into CAR T cell toxicity, mitigation strategies, and response, we explored the reporting of cytokine detection methods and assessed for the correlation of cytokines to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) across clinical trials. In this analysis, we reviewed 21 clinical trials across 60 manuscripts that featured a US Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR T cell construct or one of its predecessors. We highlight substantial variability and limited reporting of cytokine measurement platforms and panels used across CAR T cell clinical trials. Specifically, across 60 publications, 28 (46.7%) did not report any cytokine data, representing 6 of 21 (28.6%) clinical trials. In the 15 trials reporting cytokine data, at least 4 different platforms were used. Furthermore, correlation of cytokines with ICANS, CRS, and CRS severity was limited. Considering the fundamental role of cytokines in CAR T cell toxicity, our manuscript supports the need to establish standardization of cytokine measurements as a key biomarker essential to improving outcomes of CAR T cell therapy.","Background and Aims:Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of liver-related mortality worldwide, with limited treatment options beyond abstinence and liver transplantation. Chronic alcohol consumption has been linked to magnesium (Mg2+) deficiency, which can influence liver disease progression. The mechanisms underlying Mg2+ homeostasis dysregulation in ALD remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the role of the Mg2+ transporter Cyclin M4 (CNNM4) in ALD by analyzing its expression patterns in patients with ALD and preclinical animal models.Approach and Results:In this study, CNNM4 is upregulated in the liver of both patients with ALD and animal models. CNNM4 overexpression triggers Mg2+ homeostasis dysregulation, linked to ALD progression. We propose a novel therapeutic approach for ALD treatment using N-acetylgalactosamine silencing RNA technology to specifically modulate Cnnm4 expression in the liver, improving mitochondrial function and alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress. Notably, silencing Cnnm4 restores protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PCMT1) activity, essential for repairing ethanol-induced protein damage. Enhancing mitochondrial activity through Cnnm4-dependent mechanisms increases S-adenosylmethionine levels, crucial for PCMT1 function, highlighting the interconnected roles of mitochondrial health and protein homeostasis in ALD treatment.Conclusions:These findings shed light on the dysregulation of Mg2+ homeostasis in ALD, providing a promising therapeutic approach targeting CNNM4. N-acetylgalactosamine siCnnm4 therapy boosts the repair processes of ethanol-damaged proteins through the upregulation of PCMT1 activity.",0
"Immunoglobulin G 3 (IgG3) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are high-value scaffolds for developing novel therapies. Despite their wide-ranging therapeutic potential, IgG3 physicochemical properties and developability characteristics remain largely under-characterized. Protein–protein interactions elevate solution viscosity in high-concentration formulations, impacting physicochemical stability, manufacturability, and the injectability of mAbs. Therefore, in this manuscript, the key molecular descriptors and biophysical properties of a model anti-IL-8 IgG1 and its IgG3 ortholog are characterized. A computational and experimental framework was applied to measure molecular descriptors impacting their downstream developability. Findings from this approach underpin a detailed understanding of the molecular characteristics of IgG3 mAbs as potential therapeutic entities. This work is the first report examining the manufacturability of IgG3 for high-concentration mAb formulations. While poorer conformational and colloidal stability and elevated solution viscosity were observed for IgG3, future efforts controlling surface potential through sequence-engineering of solvent-accessible patches can be used to improve biophysical parameters that dictate mAb developability.","BackgroundFew data are available on the impact of venous thrombotic events (VTE) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) treated with immunotherapy.MethodsThis is a secondary analysis of the ESKEYP study, a national, retrospective, multicenter study that consecutively included all PD-L1 ≥ 50% mNSCLC patients who initiated first-line treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy. From May 2017 to November 2019, 845 patients were included (from availability of pembrolizumab in this indication in France to the authorization of the combination with chemotherapy). Impact of VTE and patient characteristics were analyzed.ResultsOf the 748 patients (88.5%) with available data, the incidence of VTE was 14.8% (111/748). At pembrolizumab initiation, Khorana score was ≥ 2 for 55.0% (61/111) of them. Recurrence of VTE was reported for 4 of the 111 patients and 5 had bleeding complications. Patients with VTE were significantly younger, had more frequently long-term corticosteroids treatment and more often liver metastases. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly shorter in patients with VTE compared to patients without VTE: 6.1 (95% CI 4.1–9.0) months vs. 8.3 (6.9–10.3) months (p = 0.03). VTE did not significantly impact overall survival (OS): 15.2 (10.0–24.7) months with VTE and 22.6 (18.4–29.8) months without VTE (p = 0.07). In multivariate analysis for PFS and OS, HRs for VTE were 1.3 (0.99–1.71), p = 0.06 and 1.32 (0.99–1.76), p = 0.05.ConclusionThe incidence of VTE appears to be as high with in first-line immunotherapy as with chemotherapy in patients with mNSCLC, with in patient with VTE, a no significant trend for lower PFS and OS in multivariate analysis. more marked impact on PFS than on OS.",0
"BackgroundThe current progressive increase in the cancer burden of prostate cancer requires the exploration of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Nanobodies are single-domain antibodies with the advantages of small size, high stability, easy processing and modification, which are increasingly used in the treatment of many types of cancer.MethodsThis review analyzed the relevant literature in PubMed and other databases.ResultIn the retrieved literature, nanobodies are widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer. The preparation of nanobodies targeting PSA or PSMA is straightforward. For diagnostic purposes, nanobodies can be used in the preparation of biosensors for more sensitive identification of prostate cancer; for therapeutic purposes, nanobodies are used in the preparation of immunotoxic and ADC drugs. Preclinical in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that this therapeutic approach is feasible. This article is a review of the above to provide new ideas for the treatment of prostate cancer.ConclusionCompared with traditional antibodies, nano-antibodies have the advantages of small size, high stability, and high penetration. These advantages make nano-antibodies worthy to be widely used. Current studies have shown that nanobodies have advantages and future in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.","Patients receiving chemotherapy by intravenous (i.v.) or oral administration of anticancer drugs often experience side effects. In this study, an electro-osmotic flow (EO) pump was used for the direct administration of an anticancer drug with minimum side effects. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DXR) was used as an anticancer drug, and its antitumor effect and toxicity were evaluated in comparison with i.v. administration. Balb/c female mice were subcutaneously transplanted with a breast cancer cell line (4T1/Luc) stably expressing luciferase, and 20 μL of DXR solution (1.0 mg/mL) was administered intratumorally (i.t.) at a slow rate (0.6 µL/min) using an EO pump or rapidly using a syringe. For comparison, 100 μL of DXR solution was injected through the tail vein at the same dose and a 5-times higher dose. A tumor growth inhibitory effect without significant weight loss was observed with direct i.t. administration of DXR using an EO pump. On the other hand, no suppressive tumor growth effect was observed with i.v. administration of DXR at the same dose. Although there was no significant difference in the suppression effect on tumor growth between i.t. administration with EO pump and syringe, the peripheral skin concentration of DXR were decreased after slow administration with EO pump compared with that after rapidly administration with a syringe. These results indicated that direct i.t. administration of DXR with lower dosing using an EO pump at slower administration rate may be useful for exhibiting antitumor effects and suppressing systemic side effects. In addition, the blood concentration and the peripheral skin concentration of DXR after administration at lower rate with EO pump were decreased compared with those after the rapidly administration with a syringe.",0
"AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.","AbstractRationaleHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.Eligibility criteriaParallel‐group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross‐over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi‐randomised trials for analysis.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non‐serious.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta‐analysed the outcome data at the longest follow‐up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random‐effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.Included studiesWe included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single‐centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia‐Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co‐interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information.The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow‐up was three months to five years.Synthesis of resultsTen trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions.Eight trials evaluated all‐cause mortality at varied follow‐up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow‐up periods taken together.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one‐year follow‐up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events.One trial measured health‐related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow‐up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health‐related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health‐related quality of life scores. No further data were provided.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non‐serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non‐serious.We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.We identified no ongoing trials.Authors' conclusionsBased on the low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all‐cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events considered non‐serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationProtocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014869.",1
"Blockade of the TGFβ signaling pathway has emerged from preclinical studies as a potential treatment to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and several other types of cancer. However, clinical translation of first-generation inhibitors has shown little success. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of HYL001, a potent inhibitor of TGFβ receptor 1 (ALK5), that is approximately 9 times more efficacious than the structurally related compound galunisertib, while maintaining a favorable safety profile. HYL001 in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1) eradicates liver metastases generated in mice by microsatellite stable, aggressive colorectal cancer tumors at doses where galunisertib is ineffective.","Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex, non-linear, dynamic multistep process that plays an integral role in the development of metastatic cancers. A diverse range of signaling molecules, along with their associated pathways, were observed to be involved in promoting EMT and cancer metastasis. Transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ), through its SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent signaling, orchestrates numerous regulators that converge on key EMT transcription factors (TFs). These TFs further govern the phenotypic transition of cancer cells from epithelial to mesenchymal states. This study explores the TGFβ signaling pathway and its unique network architecture to understand their information processing roles in EMT. Two coherent type 1 feed forward network motifs regulating the expression of SNAIL and N-cadherin were observed. SNAIL, which is one of the crucial regulators of EMT, links both the coherent type 1 feed forward loops (C1FFLs) leading to hypermotif-like structure (Adler and Medzhitov, 2022). Systems modeling and analysis of these motifs and hypermotifs illustrated several interesting emergent information processing roles of the regulators involved. The known roles of these regulators, as described in the literature, were highly correlated with the emergent properties observed. The motifs illustrated persistence detection and noise filtration in regulating the expression of SNAIL and N-cadherin. Along with these system-level properties, the hypermotif architecture also exhibited temporal expression of GLI, SNAIL, ZEB, and N-cadherin. Furthermore, a hypothetical three-layered C1FFL hypermotif was postulated and analyzed. The analysis revealed various interesting system-level properties. However, possible existence of such real biological networks needs further exploration both theoretically and experimentally. Deciphering these network motifs and hypermotifs has provided an additional understanding of the complex biological phenomenon, such as EMT in cancer metastasis.",1
"BackgroundNecroptosis has been linked to the development of tumors. Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been identified as having a major role in numerous biological and pathological procedures. Despite this, the precise role that necroptosis-related lncRNAs (NRLs) have in cervical cancer (CC) and their potential for predicting its prognosis is still to a large extent unclear.MethodsGene expression RNA-sequencing data, mutational data, and clinical profiles for 309 CC patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The NRLs were then identified with Pearson correlation analysis followed by splitting of the patients into training and validation sets in a 3:2 ratio. Cox and LASSO regression models were performed to construct a cervical cancer prognostic signature based on NRLs. This 5-NRLs signature was then verified by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and nomogram for prognostic prediction. Further, a correlation study between the risk score (RS) and immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint molecules, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and the sensitivity of chemotherapy drug was conducted. To validate the 5-NRLs, a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was finally performed.ResultsThe 5-NRLs signature was designed to accurately predict the prognosis of CC. It consists of AC092153.1, AC007686.3, LINC01281, AC009097.2, and RUSC1-AS1 and was found to be highly predictive using ROC and Kaplan–Meier curves. Furthermore, when analyzed through stratified survival analysis, it was confirmed to be an independent risk factor for prognosis. The nomogram and calibration curves further validated its clinical utility. Moreover, distinct differences between two risk groups were observed when examining immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint molecules, somatic gene alterations and half-inhibitory concentration of anticancer drug.ConclusionsThe 5-NRLs signature is a novel and valuable tool for evaluating the prognosis of CC patients, providing clinicians with an informed decision-making framework to formulate tailored treatment plans for their patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05158-3.","AbstractBACKGROUNDThe paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are an uncommon phenomenon with diverse clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of PNS is often challenging because of the broad range of clinical manifestations and the difficulties in the detection of antibodies (AB) that are confirmatory for the diagnosis. Recently published Updated Diagnostic Criteria for PNS improved the efficacy and accuracy of clinical practice but leaves a “gray zone”. The utilization of immunotherapy is rapidly expanding, but the safety and the efficacy of the immunotherapy in PNS patients are unclear as well. Managing PNS is challenging, as there is no consensus on the type of immunomodulatory therapy and the indications for advanced treatment lines. MATERIAL AND METHODSWe retrospectively evaluated the data about the case of PNS treated in the neurology department and Neuro-oncology unit at Sheba MC Israel. RESULTS68 years old male was hospitalized at July 2022 with C7-T3 myelopathy syndrome. The evaluation was negative excluding protein 75 mg/dl and mild pleocytosis, but negative cytology. There was clinical improvement after Methylprednisolon treatment. At March 2023 the patient admitted with acute onset of Lt. hemiparesis and Lt. hemihypoesthesia that developed three weeks after COVID-19 infection. PNS panels of high-risk and low-risk AB in serum and CSF were negative. The Brain MRI showed Rt. thalamic and internal capsule lesion that was hyperintense in FLAIR sequence and homogeneously enhanced by contrast in T1 sequence. The lesion was diagnosed as TUMEFACTIVE demyelinating lesion. Transient clinical and radiological response on steroids treatment was reached. The systemic evaluation revealed the Rt. axillary mass that was diagnosed as BRAF V600E mutated melanoma and case was diagnose as probable PNS. The treatment by BRAF and MEK inhibitors was started and sustained clinical and radiological neurological improvement and oncological complete response were reached.CONCLUSIONMany questions arise while making therapeutic decisions that relate to PNS. One of those is the question of if cancer therapy alone is sufficient and if it is possible to skip the advanced immunomodulatory treatment lines, because immunosuppression constitutes an aggravating prognostic factor for oncological outcome. New targeted oncological therapies have a short time to response which makes this therapeutic approach possible and our case illustrates the concept.",0
"ABSTRACTCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique class of covalently closed single-stranded RNA molecules that play diverse roles in normal physiology and pathology. Among the major types of circRNA, exon-intron circRNA (EIciRNA) distinguishes itself by its sequence composition and nuclear localization. Recent RNA-seq technologies and computational methods have facilitated the detection and characterization of EIciRNAs, with features like circRNA intron retention (CIR) and tissue-specificity being characterized. EIciRNAs have been identified to exert their functions via mechanisms such as regulating gene transcription, and the physiological relevance of EIciRNAs has been reported. Within this review, we present a summary of the current understanding of EIciRNAs, delving into their identification and molecular functions. Additionally, we emphasize factors regulating EIciRNA biogenesis and the physiological roles of EIciRNAs based on recent research. We also discuss the future challenges in EIciRNA exploration, underscoring the potential for novel functions and functional mechanisms of EIciRNAs for further investigation.","abstractOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a highly unpredictable disease with devastating mortality rates that have not changed over the past decades, in the face of advancements in treatments and biomarkers, which have improved survival for other cancers. Delays in diagnosis are frequent, leading to more disfiguring treatments and poor outcomes for patients. The clinical challenge lies in identifying those patients at the highest risk of developing OSCC. Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a precursor of OSCC with highly variable behavior across patients. There is no reliable clinical, pathological, histological, or molecular biomarker to determine individual risk in OED patients. Similarly, there are no robust biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes or mortality in OSCC patients. This review aims to highlight advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to develop predictive biomarkers of OED transformation to OSCC or predictive biomarkers of OSCC mortality and treatment response. Biomarkers such as S100A7 demonstrate promising appraisal for the risk of malignant transformation of OED. Machine learning-enhanced multiplex immunohistochemistry workflows examine immune cell patterns and organization within the tumor immune microenvironment to generate outcome predictions in immunotherapy. Deep learning (DL) is an AI-based method using an extended neural network or related architecture with multiple “hidden” layers of simulated neurons to combine simple visual features into complex patterns. DL-based digital pathology is currently being developed to assess OED and OSCC outcomes. The integration of machine learning in epigenomics aims to examine the epigenetic modification of diseases and improve our ability to detect, classify, and predict outcomes associated with epigenetic marks. Collectively, these tools showcase promising advancements in discovery and technology, which may provide a potential solution to addressing the current limitations in predicting OED transformation and OSCC behavior, both of which are clinical challenges that must be addressed in order to improve OSCC survival.Impact StatementOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a highly unpredictable and deadly disease. Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) represents a precursor to OSCC, also with a highly variable malignant transformation risk. There is no reliable clinical, pathological, histological, or molecular biomarker to determine individual cancer risk in OED patients. Similarly, there are no robust biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes or mortality in OSCC patients.

"ABSTRACTKirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation is prognostic of poor survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS G12C mutations occur in 13% of NSCLC cases and despite the frequency of this mutation, advances in drug development against KRAS have historically been impeded due to the extremely high affinity of KRAS for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and the lack of a binding pocket on the surface of KRAS that is suitable for drug binding. Sotorasib, a first-in-class, highly selective KRAS G12C inhibitor overcomes this issue by irreversibly binding in the switch-II pocket. Sotorasib was granted accelerated FDA approval for the treatment of KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This review summarizes the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and clinical considerations of sotorasib.","Lung cancer is among the most common instances of cancer subtypes and is associated with high mortality rates. Due to the availability of fewer therapies and delayed clinical investigations, the number of cancer incidences is rising dramatically. This is possibly an effect of immune modulations and chemotherapeutic drugs that raises cancer resistance. Among the list, IL-6 and IL-17 are host-derived paradoxical effectors that attune immune responses in malignant lung cells. Their excessive release in the cytokine milieu stabilizes immunosuppressive phenotypes, resulting in cellular perturbations. During tumor development, the significance of these molecules is reflected in their potential to regulate oncogenesis by initiating a myriad of signaling events that influence tumor growth and the metastatic ability of benign cancer cells. Moreover, their transactivation contributes to antiapoptotic mechanisms and favors cancer cell survival via constitutive expression of immunoregulatory molecules. Co-evolution and gene duplication events could be the major drivers behind cytokine evolution, which have prompted generic changes and, hence, the additive effect. The evolutionary model and statistical analysis provide evidence about the cytokines ancestral relationships and site-specific conservation, which is more convincing as both cytokines share cysteine-knot-like structures important in maintaining structural integrity. Funneling through the findings could help find residues that serve a catalytic role in immune functioning. Designing peptides or subunit vaccine formulations against those conserved residues could aid in combating lung cancer pathogenesis.",1
"Metabolic adaptation serves as a significant driving force for cancer growth and poses a substantial obstacle for cancer therapies. Herein, we unraveled the role of m6A-mediated serine synthesis pathway (SSP) regulation in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrated that treatment of highly specific m6A inhibitor (STM2457) effectively inhibited HCC cell line growth and suppressed spontaneous HCC formation in mice driven by liver-specific Tp53 knockout and Myc overexpression. Using GLORI-seq, we delineated a single-base-resolution m6A landscape in human HCC cell lines. Interestingly, we identified three core enzymes in the SSP (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) as novel targets of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In these SSP genes, m6A modification recruited m6A reader IGF2BP3 to stabilize their mRNA transcripts, thereby enhancing their mRNA and protein expression in HCC cells. Most importantly, our GLORI-seq data revealed that sorafenib-resistant HCC cells elevated m6A modification in SSP genes to promote protein expression and antioxidant production. STM2457 treatment attenuated the serine synthesis pathway, induced oxidative stress, and sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib treatments. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting m6A could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","PurposeThis study aimed to investigate whether N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related long non-coding RNAs (m6ARelncRNAs) could provide novel tools to predict overall survival of renal clear cell carcinoma.MethodsThe transcriptomic data and clinical information of patients with renal clear cell carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed. Distinct m6A modification patterns were systemically analysed via consensus clustering analysis. An m6ARelncRNA signature was constructed in the training cohort using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis and validated in the test cohort. Potential predictive accuracy of the signature was further assessed via Kaplan–Meier survival, univariate and multivariate Cox regression and subgroup analyses. The Tumour Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm was used to investigate the role of m6ARelncRNAs in guiding immunotherapy for patients with renal carcinoma.ResultsAn m6ARelncRNA signature based on only six lncRNAs was successfully constructed. The high-risk group derived from this signature had significantly poorer overall survival in both training and test cohorts (p < 0.001). Independent prognostic analysis further revealed that m6ARelncRNA risk (p < 0.01) was an independent risk factor for survival outcomes of renal carcinoma. TIDE algorithm revealed that immunotherapy response was poorer in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity analysis based on IC50 revealed that high-risk patients were potentially sensitive to various anti-tumour drugs, including bortezomib, cisplatin, docetaxel, etoposide and sunitinib.Conclusionm6ARelncRNAs provide novel tools that can be used to predict overall survival and examine the immune microenvironment of renal clear cell carcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04389-0.",1
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), resulting in poor clinical outcomes and high mortality. The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Punicalagin (PCG), a polyphenol obtained from the Punica granatum, against TNBC. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of PCG in TNBC (MDA-MB-231, BT-20) and ER + (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. A dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was observed with PCG (12.5–100 μM). However, only 50 and 100 μM doses of PCG inhibited the growth of BT-20 and MCF-7 cells. PCG significantly increased mitochondrial ROS in TNBC cells and induced autophagy across all cell lines, as evidenced by an increase in autophagic vacuoles and a decrease in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. PCG suppressed PI3K/Akt and activated phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) signaling. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that PCG is capable of significantly inhibiting the proliferation of TNBC cells through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway as well as the initiation of the JNK pathway. PCG could thus be potentially useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of TNBC.Graphical abstract","PurposeThere is not much progress in the treatment for lung squamous cell carcinoma LSCC in the past few years. Rapamycin Rapa, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR, has exhibited antitumor efficacy in a variety of malignant tumors. It has recently been reported that Rapamycin can induce autophagy signaling pathway in lung cancer and Glypican-3GPC3 can promote the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by stimulating canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of rapamycin’s antitumor efficacy in relation to GPC3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy in LSCC.MethodsSK-MES-1 cells, a LSCC cell line, were treated with various concentrations of rapamycin with or without Glypican-3 GPC3-targeting siRNA. SK-MES-1 cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Protein expression levels of GPC3, β-catenin, Beclin-1 were checked via western blotting. We established the xenograft mice model to investigate the suppression effect of rapamycin on LSCC. In addition, we further testified the metabolism protein of autophagy process using the xenograft tumor tissue. ResultsRapamycin could inhibit the SK-MES-1 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the GPC3 expression and downregulating the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we found that GPC3 silencing can activate the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy, which contribute to the suppression of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionRapamycin suppresses the growth of lung cancer through down-regulating glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which mediates with activation of autophagy. This study suggests GPC3 is a new promising target for rapamycin in the treatment of lung cancer.",1
"BackgroundSeveral translational animal models have been described assessing intra-arterial (IA) treatments for malignant gliomas. We describe the first endovascular animal model that allows testing of IA drug delivery as a first-line treatment, which is difficult to do in actual patients. We report a unique protocol for vascular access and IA delivery in the rat model that, unlike prior reports, does not require direct puncture and opening of proximal cerebrovasculature which carries risk of ischemia in the animal brain post-delivery.MethodsWistar rats underwent left femoral artery catherization with a Balt Magic 1.2F catheter or Marathon Flow directed 1.5F Microcatheter with an Asahi Chikai 0.008 micro-guidewire which was navigated to the left internal carotid artery under x-ray. 25% mannitol was administered to test blood brain barrier breakdown (BBBB). Additional rats were implanted with C6 glioma cells in the left frontal lobe. C6 Glioma-Implanted Rats (C6GRs) were monitored for overall survival and tumor growth. Tumor volumes from MRI images were calculated utilizing 3D slicer. Additional rats underwent femoral artery catheterization with Bevacizumab, carboplatin, or irinotecan injected into the left internal carotid artery to test feasibility and safety.ResultsA successful endovascular access and BBBB protocol was established. BBBB was confirmed with positive Evans blue staining. 10 rats were successfully implanted with C6 gliomas with confirmed growths on MRI. Overall survival was 19.75 ± 2.21 days. 5 rats were utilized for the development of our femoral catheterization protocol and BBBB testing. With regards to IA chemotherapy dosage testing, control rats tolerated targeted 10 mg/kg of bevascizumab, 2.4 mg/kg of carboplatin, and 15 mg/kg of irinotecan IA ICA injections without any complications.ConclusionsWe present the first endovascular IA rat glioma model that allows selective catheterization of the intracranial vasculature and assessment of IA therapies for gliomas without need for access and sacrifice of proximal cerebrovasculature.","PurposeThe advent of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies this year has changed the way glioblastoma (GBM) is treated. Meanwhile, some patients with strong PD-L1 expression remain immune checkpoint resistant. To better understand the molecular processes that influence the immune environment, there is an urgent need to characterize the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and identify biomarkers to predict patient survival outcomes.Patients and methodsOur study analyzed RNA-sequencing data from 178 GBM samples. Their unique gene expression patterns in the tumor microenvironment were analyzed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Through these expression patterns, a panel of T-cell exhaustion signatures, immunosuppressive cells, and clinical features correlates with immunotherapy response. The presence or absence of immune status and prognostic signatures was then validated with the test dataset.Results38.2% of GBM patients showed increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, significant enrichment of T cell exhaustion signals, higher proportion of immunosuppressive cells (macrophages and CD4 regulatory T cells) and nine inhibitory checkpoints (CTLA4, PDCD1, LAG3, BTLA, TIGIT, HAVCR2, IDO1, SIGLEC7, and VISTA). The immunodepleted class (IDC) was used to classify these immunocompromised individuals. Despite the high density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes shown by IDC, such patients have a poor prognosis. Although PD-L1 was highly expressed in IDC, it suggested that there might be ICB resistance. There are many IDC predictive signatures to discover.ConclusionPD-1 is strongly expressed in a novel immunosuppressive class of GBM, but this cluster may be resistant to ICB therapy. A comprehensive description of this drug-resistant tumor microenvironment could provide new insights into drug resistance mechanisms and improved immunotherapy techniques.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05173-4.",1
"Background:In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) revolution is rapidly moving from metastatic to early-stage, however, the impact of clinicopathological variables and optimal treatment sequencing remain unclear.Methods:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with ICI as single agent or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (PCT) were included. Primary outcomes were pathological complete response (pCR), event free survival (EFS) (neoadjuvant/perioperative), and disease-free survival (DFS) (adjuvant). Secondary outcomes were major pathological response (MPR), overall survival (OS), toxicity, surgical outcomes (neoadjuvant/perioperative); OS and toxicity (adjuvant). An additional secondary endpoint was to compare EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative strategies.Results:8 RCTs (2 neoadjuvant, 4 perioperative, 2 adjuvant) (4661 participants) were included. Neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI+PCT significantly improved pCR, EFS, OS, MPR and R0 resection compared to PCT. Adjuvant ICI significantly improved DFS compared to placebo. There was a significant subgroup interaction by PD-L1 status (χ2 = 10.72, P = 0.005), pCR (χ2 = 17.80, P < 0.0001), and stage (χ2 = 4.46, P = 0.003) for EFS. No difference according to PD-L1 status was found for pCR, with 14% of patients having PD-L1 negative tumors still experiencing a pCR. No interaction by PD-L1 status was found for DFS upon adjuvant ICI. Indirect comparison showed no difference in EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative ICI+PCT.Conclusions:PD-L1 status, pCR and stage impact on survival upon neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI. The restriction of neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI to PD-L1 + patients could preclude pCR and long-term benefit in the PD-L1-subgroup. Neoadjuvant and perioperative could be equivalent strategies.","AbstractBackground:Durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) failed to bring survival benefits to patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in PACIFIC study (evaluating durvalumab in patients with stage III, unresectable NSCLC who did not have disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy). We aimed to explore whether locally advanced inoperable patients with EGFR mutations benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the optimal treatment regimen.Methods:We searched the PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to December 31, 2022 and performed a meta-analysis based on a Bayesian framework, with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoints.Results:A total of 1156 patients were identified in 16 studies that included 6 treatment measures, including CRT, CRT followed by durvalumab (CRT-Durva), TKI monotherapy, radiotherapy combined with TKI (RT-TKI), CRT combined with TKI (CRT-TKI), and TKI combined with durvalumab (TKI-Durva). The PFS of patients treated with TKI-containing regimens was significantly longer than that of patients treated with TKI-free regimens (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20–0.66). The PFS of TKI monotherapy was significantly longer than that of CRT (HR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.50–0.87) but shorter than RT-TKI (HR = 1.78, 95% CI, 1.17–2.67). Furthermore, the PFS of RT-TKI or CRT-TKI were both significantly longer than that of CRT or CRT-Durva. RT-TKI ranked first in the Bayesian ranking, with the longest OS (60.8 months, 95% CI = 37.2–84.3 months) and the longest PFS (21.5 months, 95% CI, 15.4–27.5 months) in integrated analysis.Conclusions:For unresectable stage III EGFR mutant NSCLC, RT and TKI are both essential. Based on the current evidence, RT-TKI brings a superior survival advantage, while CRT-TKI needs further estimation. Large randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to explore the appropriate application sequences of TKI, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.Registration:PROSPERO;  No. CRD42022298490.",1
"BackgroundGlioma is the most common primary intracranial tumor. It is notorious for its high degree of malignancy, strong invasion, and poor prognosis. The transmembrane emp24 trafficking protein 3 (TMED3) belongs to the TMED family, which is responsible for intracellular protein transport and innate immune signal transmission. More and more evidence shows that TMED3 plays a key role in the tumor progression of human cancer. However, the role and potential molecular mechanism of TMED3 in glioma have not been clarified.MethodsTMED3 expression levels, clinical data, survival prognosis, prediction of upstream miRNA, and immune-related analyses were all analyzed utilizing relevant databases. Finally, a molecular cell experiment confirmed TMED3 expression in glioma.ResultsWe discovered that TMED3 is overexpressed in most tumors, including gliomas, and is associated with tumor staging and prognosis. Subsequently, a combination of a series of bioinformatics analyses, including correlation and survival analyses, identified miR-1296-5p as the most potent upstream miRNA of TMED3 in gliomas.Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between TMED3 level and tumor immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression.ConclusionTMED3 is highly expressed in gliomas and is associated with tumor staging and affects the prognosis of patients. Therefore, the TMED3 gene may be a potential immunotherapy target and prognostic marker for gliomas.","BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.",1
"AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.","AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.",1

The incidence of musculoskeletal immune-related adverse events (MSK irAEs) remains unclear.ObjectiveTo estimate the relative risk of MSK irAEs in melanoma patients treated with ICIs targeting programmed cell death-1 or its ligand PD-(L)1 as compared to placebo.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature review including phase III randomized controlled trials of adult melanoma patients comparing a PD-(L)1 inhibitor to a placebo arm. Outcomes of interest included arthralgias, arthritis, back pain and myalgias. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled relative risk of MSK irAEs over the treatment course.ResultsFour RCTs met the inclusion criteria (n = 3,041 subjects). Use of PD-(L)1 inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of developing arthralgias (RR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.13–1.49]) and myalgias (RR 1.48 [95% CI: 1.17–1.87]) as compared to placebo. Back pain and arthritis were not reported.ConclusionsUse of PD-(L)1 inhibitors is associated with a significantly increased risk of arthralgias and myalgias in melanoma patients. The risk of back pain and arthritis is unknown.Implications for practiceMSK irAEs can impact quality of life and should be considered, particularly in the adjuvant setting when risks and benefits are carefully weighed.",0
"Purpose:There are few markers to identify those likely to recur or progress after treatment with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). We developed and validated artificial intelligence (AI)–based histologic assays that extract interpretable features from transurethral resection of bladder tumor digitized pathology images to predict risk of recurrence, progression, development of BCG-unresponsive disease, and cystectomy.Materials and Methods:Pre-BCG resection-derived whole-slide images and clinical data were obtained for high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer cases treated with BCG from 12 centers and were analyzed through a segmentation and feature extraction pipeline. Features associated with clinical outcomes were defined and tested on independent development and validation cohorts. Cases were classified into high or low risk for recurrence, progression, BCG-unresponsive disease, and cystectomy.Results:Nine hundred forty-four cases (development: 303, validation: 641, median follow-up: 36 months) representative of the intended use population were included (high-grade Ta: 34.1%, high-grade T1: 54.8%; carcinoma in situ only: 11.1%, any carcinoma in situ: 31.4%). In the validation cohort, “high recurrence risk” cases had inferior high-grade recurrence-free survival vs “low recurrence risk” cases (HR, 2.08, P < .0001). “High progression risk” patients had poorer progression-free survival (HR, 3.87, P < .001) and higher risk of cystectomy (HR, 3.35, P < .001) than “low progression risk” patients. Cases harboring the BCG-unresponsive disease signature had a shorter time to development of BCG-unresponsive disease than cases without the signature (HR, 2.31, P < .0001). AI assays provided predictive information beyond clinicopathologic factors.Conclusions:We developed and validated AI-based histologic assays that identify high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer cases at higher risk of recurrence, progression, BCG-unresponsive disease, and cystectomy, potentially aiding clinical decision making.","ABSTRACTPoly(amino acid) nanomedicines hold significant promise for cancer therapy.

"IntroductionOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent malignant condition. This study aimed to investigate the role of mTORC1 signaling and develop a prognostic model for OSCC.Materials and MethodsThe single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was utilized to calculate the Z-Score of Hallmarks in OSCC, followed by univariate Cox regression analysis to identify processes associated with prognosis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed using transcriptomic data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) cohort to identify genes correlated with mTORC1 signaling. A six-gene prognostic model was constructed using multifactorial Cox regression analysis and validated using an external dataset.ResultsThe study uncovered a strong linkage between mTORC1, glycolysis, hypoxia, and the prognosis of OSCC. mTORC1 signaling emerged as the most significant risk factor, negatively impacting patient survival. Additionally, a six-gene prognostic risk score model was developed which provided a quantitative measure of patients' survival probabilities. Interestingly, within the context of these findings, TP53 gene mutations were predominantly observed in the high-risk group, potentially underlining the genetic complexity of this patient subgroup. Additionally, differential immune cell infiltration and an integrated nomogram were also reported.ConclusionThis study highlights the importance of mTORC1 signaling in OSCC prognosis and presents a robust prognostic model for predicting patient outcomes.","ABSTRACTTetrandrine (Tet), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid from Stephania tetrandra, is noted for its diverse pharmacological effects but faces limitations in clinical use due to toxicity, poor solubility, and low bioavailability. Researchers are working to address these issues by developing Tet derivatives with greater therapeutic potential through structural modification. Generally, key modifications include: 1) introducing an aromatic heterocycle or a hydrophobic alkyne unit at the C-5 position can enhance its antitumor activity; 2) adding an amide, sulfonamide, or electron-withdrawing group at the C-14 position can enhance its antitumor activity; 3) changing its structure to a quaternary ammonium salt can alter its solubility and greatly boost its antibacterial activity; 4) structural modification of the C-12-methoxybenzyl motif can enhance its metabolic stability and thus change the activity of the analogs; 5) Tet structural simplification may result in the identification of anticancer lead compounds with novel mechanisms of action. This review systematically summarizes these modification strategies and evaluates the biological activities of Tet derivatives, aiming to guide further optimization and facilitate the discovery of lead analogs with improved efficacy. The future direction and possibility of Tet structural optimization are also considered.",0
"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). This review specifically aims to investigate the role of latent microbial infections-such as those caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Chlamydia pneumoniae, and others-in contributing to myelin and axon damage in MS. Methods: We evaluated recent studies from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases that focus on the relationship between latent microbial infections and MS pathogenesis. Results: In MS, emerging evidence suggests that latent microbial infections play a significant role in triggering and perpetuating the inflammatory processes associated with the disease. The potential mechanisms by which these infections contribute to the pathogenesis of MS, highlighting the interplay between the immune system, microbial agents, and the CNS are evaluated. These include molecular mimicry, where similarities in sequence or structure between viral, bacterial, or self-peptides can activate autoreactive T or B cells through cross activation by pathogen-derived peptides, chronic inflammation triggered by persistent infection, leading to immune-mediated damage, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, allowing microbial agents or immune cells to infiltrate the CNS. Conclusion: This review underscores the critical role of latent microbial infections in MS pathogenesis. By elucidating these mechanisms, we provide new insights that could inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions and preventive strategies for MS.","ABSTRACTGraves disease (GD) is the primary cause of hyperthyroidism in children. The standard management options—namely, antithyroid drugs (ATD), radioactive iodine, and surgery—have not changed for many years. Although ATD therapy is often the first-line treatment for pediatric patients, the low likelihood of spontaneous remission means that most children will require a more permanent solution. Recent clinical trials and systematic reviews have shed light on the long-term outcomes of ATD therapy, radioactive iodine, and surgical interventions in managing pediatric GD. Additionally, novel therapies aimed at B-cells or the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, both implicated in the pathogenesis of GD, are under investigation. However, their definitive role in treating childhood GD has yet to be established. This review will cover the latest developments in the treatment of childhood GD, including information on emerging targeted therapies.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown limited success in patients with solid tumors. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have shown that adrenoceptor beta-2 (ADRB2) is a novel checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. To inhibit ADRB2-mediated inhibitory signaling, we downregulated ADRB2 in CAR-T (shβ2-CAR-T) cells via RNA interference, assessed different parameters, and compared them with conventional second-generation CAR-T cells. ADRB2 knockdown CAR-T cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, by increasing CD69, CD107a, GzmB, IFN-γ, T-bet, and GLUT-1. In addition, ADRB2 deficiency led to improved proliferation, increased CD8/CD4 T cell ratio, and decreased apoptosis in CAR-T cells. shβ2-CAR-T cells expressed more Bcl-2 and led to the generation of more significant proportions of T central memory cells. Finally, the ZAP-70/NF-κB signaling axis was shown to be responsible for the improved functions of novel CAR-T cells. In tumor-bearing mice, shβ2-CAR-T cells performed better than conventional CAR-T cells in eradicating prostate tumors. The study provides the basis for future clinical and translational CAR-T cell research to focus on adrenergic stress-mediated challenges in the tumor microenvironment of stressed tumors.","Background and Aims:Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a promising target for T-cell therapy in HCC. While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting GPC3 have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy, their effectiveness is limited by challenges such as low persistence and shedding of surface GPC3. Natural T-cell receptors (TCRs) may serve as an alternative, though identifying GPC3-specific TCRs within the endogenous repertoire is difficult.Approach and Results:We immunized human leucocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2) transgenic mice with an adenovirus expressing human GPC3, identifying a panel of TCRs that recognize the GPC3(522-530) epitope. We cloned 3 murine GPC3-TCRs (TCR-A, TCR-B, and TCR-C) and engineered primary human T cells (TCR-T). TCR-T cells effectively recognized GPC3+HLA-A2+ human HCC cells, with recognition diminished by GPC3 silencing and HLA-A2 blockade. TCR-B-T and TCR-C-T cells showed the highest reactivity, with TCR-B-T cells exhibiting superior effector functions, proliferative capacity, and therapeutic efficacy in xenograft HCC models. Notable, TCR-B-T cells outperformed second-generation 41BB GPC3-specific CAR-T cells, attributed to lower exhaustion, enhanced proliferation, greater effector function, and improved resilience. Furthermore, mixed dosing of CAR-T and TCR-B-T cells was significantly more effective than staggered dosing of the same cell type, suggesting potential synergistic effects.Conclusions:Transgenic TCRs join forces with CARs, expanding the arsenal of GPC3-targeting receptors for HCC T-cell therapy.",1
"BackgroundT cells have been proven to play important roles in anti-tumor and tumor microenvironment shaping, while these roles have not been explained in bladder cancer (BLCA).MethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to screen T-cell marker genes. Bulk RNA-sequencing data and clinical information from BLCA patients were downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database to develop a prognosis signature. We analyzed the association of different risk groups with survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and immunotherapy response.ResultsBased on 192 T-cell marker genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis, we constructed a prognostic signature containing 7 genes in the training cohort, which was further validated in the testing cohort and GEO cohort. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 1-, 3-, and 5 years were 0.734, 0.742 and 0.726 in the training cohort, 0.697, 0.671 and 0.670 in the testing cohort, 0.702, 0.665 and 0.629 in the GEO cohort, respectively. In addition, we constructed a nomogram based on clinical factors and the risk score of the signature. The low-risk group exhibited higher immune-related pathways, immune cell infiltration and TMB levels. Importantly, immunophenotype score and immunotherapy cohort (IMvigor210) analyses showed that the low-risk group had better immunotherapy response and prognosis.ConclusionsOur study reveals a novel prognostic signature based on T-cell marker genes, which provides a new target and theoretical support for BLCA patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04881-1.","Background:To improve patient selection for sentinel node (SN) biopsy, the Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA) created a predictive model based on readily available clinicopathologic factors.Objectives:Validation of the MIA nomogram using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), a nationwide oncology outcomes database for >1500 Commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States.Methods:A total of 60,165 patients were included in the validation. The probability of SN positivity was calculated for each patient. Using calculated probabilities, a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to assess the model’s discrimination ability.Results:At baseline, the NCDB cohort had different clinicopathologic characteristics compared with the original MIA data set. Despite these differences, the MIA nomogram retained high-predictive accuracy within the NCDB dataset (C-statistic, 0.733 [95% CI, 0.726–0.739]), although calibration weakened for the highest risk decile.Limitations:The NCDB collects data from hospital registries accredited by the Commission on Cancer.Conclusions:In conclusion, this study validated the use of the MIA nomogram in a nationwide oncology outcomes database collected from >1500 Commission-accredited cancer programs in the United States, demonstrating the potential for this nomogram to predict SN positivity and reduce the number of negative SN biopsies.",0
"BackgroundNon-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) makes up about 85% of lung cancer cases, mainly adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Recently, PD-1 inhibitors have become crucial in NSCLC treatment, significantly enhancing survival for some. However, side effects, like skin reactions and hematotoxicity, limit their use, with drug-induced TEN and immunotherapy-induced agranulocytosis as severe adverse effects.Case PresentationHerein, we have reported the case of a 75-year-old male diagnosed with metastatic Lung Squamous cell Carcinoma (LUSC) in the left lung. He received first-line treatment with one cycle of tislelizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, after which he developed Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and granulocytopenia. To address these two serious immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs), the patient was administered methylprednisolone in combination with gamma globulin for TEN and dexamethasone in combination with G-CSF for agranulocytosis. Antibiotics were also administered according to the patient’s medication regimen. After treatment, the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital. It was also noted that the lung tumor condition improved.ConclusionEffective management of severe immune-related side effects from tislelizumab, including TEN and agranulocytosis, can be partly achieved through steroids, gamma globulin, G-CSF, and antibiotics. This strategy not only alleviates these adverse effects, but also potentially improves tumor conditions, highlighting the crucial role of vigilant monitoring and management in immunotherapy.","AbstractMicrosatellite instability (MSI) is an important biomarker in cancer. While routine methods can detect MSI in certain tumor types, in other tumor types the results may be incorrect due to differences in the MSI loci pattern. Here, we report the case of a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with confirmed MSI by two independent next-generation sequencing tests, but not by routine methods, who had progression on pembrolizumab. Comparison of the patient’s MSI loci patterns with MSI+ colorectal adenocarcinoma samples showed a lower fraction of unstable loci, low resolution of a second peak in the repeat length spectrum of unstable short tandem repeats in the patient's sample, and a lower length of indels (3.7 vs 4.5 base pairs, p < 0.01).",1
"We present a case of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with metastasis to the right ventricle (RV) successfully treated through surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). A 50-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, prompting transthoracic echocardiography that revealed a mobile, irregular RV mass measuring 40 × 32 mm. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed masses in the RV and the right pulmonary artery, which was totally occluded. Emergency surgical resection of both masses was performed to avoid sudden death. Histopathological analysis confirmed squamous cell carcinoma; however, the primary origin of the masses remained unidentified despite extensive evaluations, including positron emission tomography-CT. The final diagnosis was SCCUP. Immunohistochemistry indicated positive programmed cell death ligand 1, and postoperative chemotherapy with an ICI was administered. One year post-surgery, the patient remains healthy with no sign of recurrence.Learning objectiveThis case shows the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with cardiac metastasis through emergency surgery and postoperative immunotherapy. Despite the poor prognosis associated with cardiac metastatic malignant tumors and the lack of established treatment guidelines, this case highlights the potential benefits of surgical intervention and the efficacy of immunotherapy in managing cardiac metastatic SCCUP, with the patient remaining with no recurrence one-year post-surgery.","Primary melanoma of the oral cavity is extremely rare, accounting for 0.2–8% of all melanomas. Lesions arising from mucosal melanocytes occur most frequently on the gingiva or palate. Mucosal melanomas carry a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanomas. Very few studies have been published due to rarity of disease. 46 year old lady presented with black colored lesion over left side of her tongue for 6 weeks. On examination there was 3 × 2.5 cm black colored patch over left lateral part of tongue in middle 1/3rd, not crossing midline. Tip and base of tongue were free. Biopsy was suggestive of malignant melanoma of tongue. Patient underwent surgery (wide local excision of left lateral border of tongue lesion + left selective neck dissection). Final Histopathological report revealed malignant melanoma of tongue with all margins free, Depth of invasion 3 mm, Lympho-vascular invasion present, and no perineural invasion, left level III cervical lymph node metastases. Patient thus received adjuvant RT. Immunotherapy was also advised in multidisciplinary clinic, but patient was non-compliant. Early diagnosis will be promoted by careful oral examination and early biopsy of pigmented and non-pigmented masses. Early diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis of patients with oral malignant melanoma.",1
"AbstractRationaleHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.Eligibility criteriaParallel‐group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross‐over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi‐randomised trials for analysis.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non‐serious.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta‐analysed the outcome data at the longest follow‐up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random‐effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.Included studiesWe included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single‐centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia‐Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co‐interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information.The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow‐up was three months to five years.Synthesis of resultsTen trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions.Eight trials evaluated all‐cause mortality at varied follow‐up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow‐up periods taken together.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one‐year follow‐up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events.One trial measured health‐related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow‐up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health‐related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health‐related quality of life scores. No further data were provided.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non‐serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non‐serious.We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.We identified no ongoing trials.Authors' conclusionsBased on the low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all‐cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events considered non‐serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationProtocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014869.","AbstractBackgroundThe comparative effects of specific blood pressure (BP) lowering treatments on patient‐important outcomes following kidney transplantation are uncertain. Our 2009 Cochrane review found that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) improved graft function and prevented graft loss, while the evidence for other BP‐lowering treatments was limited. This is an update of the 2009 Cochrane review.ObjectivesTo compare the benefits and harms of different classes and combinations of antihypertensive drugs in kidney transplant recipients.Search methodsWe contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 3 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating any BP‐lowering agent in recipients of a functioning kidney transplant for at least two weeks were eligible.Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently assessed the risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised using the random‐effects model and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) processes. The primary outcomes included all‐cause death, graft loss, and kidney function.Main resultsNinety‐seven studies (8706 participants) were included. One study evaluated treatment in children. The overall risk of bias was unclear to high across all domains.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, CCBs probably reduce all‐cause death (23 studies, 3327 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) and graft loss (24 studies, 3577 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). CCBs may make little or no difference to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (11 studies, 2250 participants: MD 1.89 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 4.48; I2 = 48%; low certainty evidence) and acute rejection (13 studies, 906 participants: RR 10.8, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). CCBs may reduce systolic BP (SBP) (3 studies, 329 participants: MD ‐5.83 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐10.24 to ‐1.42; I2 = 13%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (DBP) (3 studies, 329 participants: MD ‐3.98 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐5.98 to ‐1.99; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). CCBs have uncertain effects on proteinuria.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) may make little or no difference to all‐cause death (7 studies, 702 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.21; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), graft loss (6 studies, 718 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.13; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), eGFR (4 studies, 509 participants: MD ‐2.46 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐7.66 to 2.73; I2 = 64%; low certainty evidence) and acute rejection (4 studies, 388 participants: RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.04; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). ACEi may reduce proteinuria (5 studies, 441 participants: MD ‐0.33 g/24 hours, 95% CI ‐0.64 to ‐0.01; I2 = 67%; low certainty evidence) but had uncertain effects on SBP and DBP.Compared to placebo or standard care alone, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may make little or no difference to all‐cause death (6 studies, 1041 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.31; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), eGRF (5 studies, 300 participants: MD ‐1.91 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI ‐6.20 to 2.38; I2 = 57%; low certainty evidence), and acute rejection (4 studies, 323 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.29; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). ARBs may reduce graft loss (6 studies, 892 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.84; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), SBP (10 studies, 1239 participants: MD ‐3.73 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐7.02 to ‐0.44; I2 = 63%; moderate certainty evidence) and DBP (9 studies, 1086 participants: MD ‐2.75 mm Hg, 95% CI ‐4.32 to ‐1.18; I2 = 47%; moderate certainty evidence), but has uncertain effects on proteinuria.The effects of CCBs, ACEi or ARB compared to placebo or standard care alone on cardiovascular outcomes (including fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke) or other adverse events were uncertain.The comparative effects of ACEi plus ARB dual therapy, alpha‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists compared to placebo or standard care alone were rarely evaluated.Head‐to‐head comparisons of ACEi, ARB or thiazide versus CCB, ACEi versus ARB, CCB or ACEi versus alpha‐ or beta‐blockers, or ACEi plus CCB dual therapy versus ACEi or CCB monotherapy were scarce. No studies reported outcome data for cancer or life participation.Authors' conclusionsFor kidney transplant recipients, the use of CCB therapy to reduce BP probably reduces death and graft loss compared to placebo or standard care alone, while ARB may reduce graft loss. The effects of ACEi and ARB compared to placebo or standard care on other patient‐centred outcomes were uncertain. The effects of dual therapy, alpha‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists compared to placebo or standard care alone and the comparative effects of different treatments were uncertain.",1
"AbstractBackgroundGlutamine is an important nutrient for cancer cell growth that provides biological sources for nucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis, but the role of glutaminolysis in signal transduction and glioblastoma (GBM) progression remains little known.MethodsKnockdown and overexpression cells were obtained to explore the functional roles of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) in cell proliferation, tumor formation, and aerobic glycolysis. RNA-seq, Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase assay, and western blot were performed to verify the regulation of the EGFR-AKT pathway by the GDH1 (also known as GLUD1) and KDM6A. Metabolite-level measurements and Seahorse Assay were performed to assess the functional role of GHD1 in reprogramming glycolysis.ResultsHere, we report that GDH1 catalytic glutaminolysis is essential for GBM cell line proliferation and brain tumorigenesis even in high-glucose conditions. Glutamine is metabolized through glutaminolysis to produce α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). We demonstrate that glutamine in combination with leucine activates mammalian TORC1 by enhancing glutaminolysis and α-KG production. α-KG increases the transcription of PDPK1 by reducing the suppressive histone modification H3K27me3 and then promotes the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This transcriptional activation induced by α-KG requires histone demethylase KDM6A, which is a 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase that plays an important role in converting α-KG to succinate. Furthermore, we show that GDH1-catalytic glutaminolysis also increases the expression of HK2 and promotes glycolysis in high-glucose conditions dependent on KDM6A-mediated demethylation of H3K27.ConclusionsThese findings suggest a novel function of glutaminolysis in the regulation of signal transduction and metabolism reprogramming and provide further evidence for the unique role of glutaminolysis in GBM progression.","Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) serves a key immunosuppressive role as a negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. HPK1 loss-of-function is associated with augmentation of immune function and has demonstrated synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in syngeneic mouse cancer models. These data offer compelling evidence for the use of selective small molecule inhibitors of HPK1 in cancer immunotherapy. We identified a novel series of isoquinoline HPK1 inhibitors through fragment-based screening that displayed promising levels of biochemical potency and activity in functional cell-based assays. We used structure-based drug design to introduce key selectivity elements while simultaneously addressing pharmacokinetic liabilities. These efforts culminated in a molecule demonstrating subnanomolar biochemical inhibition of HPK1 and strong in vitro augmentation of TCR signaling in primary human T-cells. Further profiling of this molecule revealed excellent kinase selectivity (347/356 kinases <50% inhibition @ 0.1 μM), a favorable in vitro safety profile, and good projected human pharmacokinetics.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Geographic accessibility predicts pediatric preventive care utilization, including vaccine uptake. However, spatial inequities in the pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination rollout remain underexplored. We assessed the spatial accessibility of vaccination sites and analyzed predictors of vaccine uptake.METHODS:In this cross-sectional study of pediatric COVID-19 vaccinations from the US Vaccine Tracking System as of July 29, 2022, we described spatial accessibility by geocoding vaccination sites, measuring travel times from each Census tract population center to the nearest site, and weighting tracts by their population demographics to obtain nationally representative estimates. We used quasi-Poisson regressions to calculate incidence rate ratios, comparing vaccine uptake between counties with highest and lowest quartile Social Vulnerability Index scores: socioeconomic status (SES), household composition and disability (HCD), minority status and language (MSL), and housing type and transportation.RESULTS:We analyzed 15 233 956 doses administered across 27 526 sites. Rural, uninsured, white, and Native American populations experienced longer travel times to the nearest site than urban, insured, Hispanic, Black, and Asian American populations. Overall Social Vulnerability Index, SES, and HCD were associated with decreased vaccine uptake among children aged 6 months to 4 years (overall: incidence rate ratio 0.70 [95% confidence interval 0.60–0.81]; SES: 0.66 [0.58–0.75]; HCD: 0.38 [0.33–0.44]) and 5 years to 11 years (overall: 0.85 [0.77–0.95]; SES: 0.71 [0.65–0.78]; HCD: 0.67 [0.61–0.74]), whereas social vulnerability by MSL was associated with increased uptake (6 months–4 years: 5.16 [3.59–7.42]; 5 years–11 years: 1.73 [1.44–2.08]).CONCLUSIONS:Pediatric COVID-19 vaccine uptake and accessibility differed by race, rurality, and social vulnerability. National supply data, spatial accessibility measurement, and place-based vulnerability indices can be applied throughout public health resource allocation, surveillance, and research.",Key Points•Therapy–mediated BCMA expression loss after belantamab or anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor T cells underlies teclistamab failure in RRMM.•Low/undetectable peripheral blood soluble BCMA reflects loss of BCMA expression by bone marrow plasma cells.,0
"ABSTRACTExtracellular Vesicles (EVs) became a focus of clinical research when experimental and pre-clinical studies showed that they mimic their parent cells’ regenerative and therapeutic effects and their cargo carries disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Since the publication of data forms an endpoint of the study, this review specifically focused on the published clinical trials done with EVs. For brevity, this review was restricted to the last 10 years. Unexpectedly, the literature search showed that very few clinical trials assessing the therapeutic applications of EVs were published in this period indicating that they have not reached their desired endpoint. Conversely, most studies showed the potential of EVs present in various biofluids as a promising source of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for various diseases, and predictive markers to assess the effectiveness of therapy. This stark difference in the numbers could perhaps be due to the time-consuming regulatory processes involved in the clinical-grade preparation and characterization of EVs, and the determination of their safety and effective dose regimens. One wonders whether fast-tracking regulatory affairs could help accelerate the therapeutic use of EVs. This aspect needs urgent attention.","ABSTRACTAging presents a significant challenge to health and social care systems due to the increasing proportion of the elderly population. The identification of reliable biomarkers to assess the progression of aging remains an unresolved question. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded covalently closed RNAs. They have been found to regulate various biological processes. CircRNAs are present in human biological fluids, are relatively stable, and accumulate with age, making them promising as biomarkers of aging. Current information on the expression of circRNAs in aging was analyzed using scientific databases. In this review, we have identified key stages in the study of circRNAs during aging and summarized the current understanding of their biogenesis. By focusing on the role of circRNAs in processes that contribute to aging – such as genomic stability, metabolism, cell death, and signaling pathways – we hypothesize that circRNAs may drive the aging process through their age-related accumulation and resultant deregulation. Examples of age-related differential expression of circRNAs in various species, including humans, are provided. This review highlights the importance of finding novel epigenetic biomarkers of aging, beyond the already identified molecules (circFOXO3, circRNA100783, circPVT1), and highlights circRNAs as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of age-associated diseases.",1
"PurposeAs a novel antiangiogenic multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved in China, anlotinib has exhibited promising anticancer efficacy and acceptable safety profile in the salvage treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in clinical trials. Here we retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third- or further-line treatment in patients with refractory SCLC.Patients and methodsA total of 40 patients with refractory SCLC treated with anlotinib monotherapy were included in this study. The clinicopathological data, treatment information, survival data and safety data were retrospectively collected. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed by log-rank testing.ResultsAltogether, 40 patients of extensive-stage SCLC or progressive limited-stage SCLC received anlotinib monotherapy as third- or further-line treatment from July 2018 to June 2020. Four patients achieved partial response (PR), 14 patients achieved stable disease (SD), no complete response (CR) was recorded, and 22 patients experienced progressive disease (PD). The disease control rate (DCR) was 45.0%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.241–3.759), and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.8 months (95% CI 3.190–12.410). The common adverse effects (AEs) included hypertension, fatigue, anorexia, cough, rash and nausea. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 3 (7.5%) patients. One patient interrupted anlotinib treatment due to repeated grade 1 epistaxis. Univariate analysis revealed that patients without liver metastases, previously treated with radiotherapy or with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0 or 1 had longer OS with anlotinib treatment. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients without liver metastases and patients with ECOG score ≤ 1 had longer PFS, while patients without liver metastases had longer OS.ConclusionAnlotinib is beneficial to refractory SCLC as third- or further-line treatment, especially in patients without liver metastasis and with better physical status. Related adverse effects are tolerable and manageable.","Contemporary anticancer therapies frequently have different efficacy and side effects in men and women. Yet, whether women are well-represented in pivotal trials supporting contemporary anticancer drugs is unknown. Leveraging the  database, clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, and publicly available FDA-drug-reviews, we identified all pivotal (phase II and III) non-sex specific trials supporting FDA-approval of anticancer drugs (1998–2018). Observed-enrollment-rates were compared to expected-population-rates derived from concurrent US-National-Cancer-Institute’s Surveillance-Epidemiology-and-End-Results (SEER) reported rates and US-Census databases. Primary outcome was the proportional representation of women across trials, evaluated by a participation-to-prevalence ratio (PPR), according to cancer type. Secondary outcome was the report of any sex-specific analysis of efficacy and/or safety, irrespective of treatment-arm. Overall, there were 148 trials, enrolling 60,216 participants (60.5±4.0 years, 40.7% female, 79.1% biologic, targeted, or immune-based therapies) evaluating 99 drugs. Sex was reported in 146 (98.6%) trials, wherein 40.7%  were women, compared to 59.3%  men (P<0.01). Altogether, women were under-represented in 66.9% trials compared to the proportional incidence of cancers by respective disease type; weight-average PPR of 0.91 (relative difference: −9.1%, P<0.01). Women were most under-represented in gastric (PPR=0.63), liver (PPR=0.71), and lung (PPR=0.81) cancer trials. Sex-based safety data was reported in 4.0% trials. There was no association between adequate female enrollment and drug efficacy (HR: 0.616 vs. 0.613, P=0.96). Over time, there was no difference in the percentage of women recruited into clinical trials. Among pivotal clinical trials supporting contemporary FDA-approved cancer drugs, women were frequently under-represented and sex-specific-efficacy and safety-outcomes were commonly not reported.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundRecently, we developed AT101, an IgM-class mouse monoclonal antibody directed against glypican-1 (GPC1), a proteoglycan that can be considered as useful target for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment being specifically and highly expressed on GBM cell surface. Here, we proposed the use of AT101 as targeting agent in a drug delivery nanoplatfom to effectively deliver chitosan nanobubbles (NBs) for GBM treatment.MethodsChitosan NBs were prepared and conjugated with AT101 or left unconjugated as control.ResultsThe ability of AT101 to bind the GPC1 protein was demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis in the “GBM-like” GPC1-expressing cell lines U-87 MG and T98G. AT101 was shown to bind GPC1-expressing GBM tumor samples by immunofluorescence. In-vivo experiments in the U-87 MG xenograft model showed that AT101 was able to bind GPC1 on cell surface and accumulate in U-87 MG tumor masses (p = 0.0002 respect to control). Moreover, in-vivo experiments showed that AT101 is able to target GPC1 when conjugated to chitosan NBs, thus increasing their specific deliver to GPC1-expressing cells of U-87 MG tumor, as compared to chitosan NBs not conjugated to AT101 (p = 0.02).ConclusionsAT101 is an useful targeting agent for the development of drug delivery nanoplatforms for GBM treatment.","Despite the enthusiasm for targeted cancer therapies in preclinical studies and the success of a select few drugs, many promising drug candidates fail in clinical trials. The gap between preclinical promise and clinical outcomes underscores the need to investigate factors influencing the success or failure of targeted therapies. Dasatinib, an inhibitor of Abl and Src protein tyrosine kinases, is highly effective toward chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by targeting BCR-Abl, but it is ineffective against solid tumors when targeting Src kinases. A review reveals cytotoxic inhibition is a key attribute predictive of dasatinib’s clinical efficacy toward CML, and cytostatic inhibition by targeting Src kinases is the underlying reason for the preclinical promise and clinical inefficacy toward solid tumors. The analysis reveals that preclinical cytotoxic inhibition is highly predictive of clinical efficacy and shows that cancer regression can only be achieved when the drug–target is an essential oncogenic driver in a monodriver cancer. The analysis highlights dasatinib’s potential in achieving stable disease in solid tumors, supporting its use in combination therapies.",1
"BackgroundAs a common psychological problem in cancer patients, illness uncertainty has attracted wide attention from scholars. Some studies have pointed out that the level of social support may affect illness uncertainty in patients with cancer, but the results of these studies remain controversial.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between illness uncertainty and social support in patients with cancer using meta-analysis.MethodsPubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and VIP Citation Database were searched for articles published up to 2022. The screening of the literature, data extraction, and quality assessment of the included studies were performed independently by 2 researchers. Stata 17.0 software was used to analyze the overall and moderation effects.ResultsNotably, 41 studies involving 5403 patients were included. The results showed that the illness uncertainty of adults with cancer was moderately negatively correlated with social support (r = −0.33). Country, publication year, cancer type, and instrument used to measure social support moderated the association between illness uncertainty and social support.ConclusionImproving the level of social support can reduce illness uncertainty experienced by adults with cancer to a certain extent.Implications for PracticeThis review provides a clear direction for implementing precise interventions to reduce illness uncertainty among adults with cancer. Furthermore, patients with cancer with high morbidity and mortality rates deserve greater attention from healthcare personnel and family caregivers.","AbstractBackgroundAdjuvant modified leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) is standard of care for fit individuals with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Data are limited on adjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX outcomes outside clinical trials.MethodsWe queried institutional databases to identify patients with resected PDAC who received 1 or more doses of adjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX. Primary endpoints were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival. Secondary endpoints were clinical factors and genomic features associated with outcomes. We estimated RFS and overall survival by using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to associate clinicogenomic features with survival outcomes.ResultsA search revealed 147 individuals with PDAC between January 2015 and January 2023. Median patient age was 67 years, with 57 (39%) patients older than 70 years. Unfavorable prognostic features included 52 (36%) patients with N2 nodal status, 115 (78%) patients with lymphovascular invasion, and 133 (90%) patients with perineural invasion. Median time from surgery to initiation of modified FOLFIRINOX was 1.78 months (IQR = 1.45-2.12). In total, 124 (84%) patients completed 12 doses; 98 (67%) patients stopped oxaliplatin early because of neuropathy (median = 10 doses, range = 4-12 doses). Further dosing characteristics are summarized in Table S3, with a median follow-up of 35.1 months, a median RFS of 26 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 19 to 39), and a median overall survival not reached. For the cohort older than 70 years of age, the median RFS was 23 months (95% CI = 14 to not reached) and the median overall survival was 51 months (95% CI = 37 to not reached). Modified FOLFIRINOX started sooner than 8 weeks from resection was associated with improved RFS (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.96; P = .033) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.3 to 0.94; P = .030). KRAS variation and whole-genome doubling trended to shorter RFS and overall survival. Homologous recombination deficiency status did not confer improved survival outcomes.ConclusionsAdjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX was effective and tolerated in patients with resected PDAC in a nontrial setting, including for patients older than 70 years of age.",0
"Abstract.PurposeThe rapid development of highly multiplexed microscopy has enabled the study of cells embedded within their native tissue. The rich spatial data provided by these techniques have yielded exciting insights into the spatial features of human disease. However, computational methods for analyzing these high-content images are still emerging; there is a need for more robust and generalizable tools for evaluating the cellular constituents and stroma captured by high-plex imaging. To address this need, we have adapted spectral angle mapping—an algorithm developed for hyperspectral image analysis—to compress the channel dimension of high-plex immunofluorescence (IF) images.ApproachHere, we present pseudo-spectral angle mapping (pSAM), a robust and flexible method for determining the most likely class of each pixel in a high-plex image. The class maps calculated through pSAM yield pixel classifications which can be combined with instance segmentation algorithms to classify individual cells.ResultsIn a dataset of colon biopsies imaged with a 13-plex staining panel, 16 pSAM class maps were computed to generate pixel classifications. Instance segmentations of cells with Cellpose2.0 (F1-score of 0.83±0.13) were combined with these class maps to provide cell class predictions for 13 cell classes. In addition, in a separate unseen dataset of kidney biopsies imaged with a 44-plex staining panel, pSAM plus Cellpose2.0 (F1-score of 0.86±0.11) detected a diverse set of 38 classes of structural and immune cells.ConclusionsIn summary, pSAM is a powerful and generalizable tool for evaluating high-plex IF image data and classifying cells in these high-dimensional images.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is facilitated by gene-silencing chromatin histone hypoacetylation due to histone deacetylase (HDAC) activation. However, inhibiting HDACs—an effective treatment for lymphomas—has shown limited success in solid tumors. We report the discovery of a class of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) that demonstrates exquisite selective cytotoxicity against human HCC cells. The lead compound STR-V-53  showed a favorable safety profile in mice and robustly suppressed tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of HCC. When combined with the anti-HCC drug sorafenib, STR-V-53, showed greater in vivo efficacy. Moreover, STR-V-53 combined with anti-PD1 therapy increased the CD8+ to regulatory T-cell (Treg) ratio and survival in an orthotopic HCC model in immunocompetent mice. This combination therapy resulted in durable responses in 40% of the mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that STR-V-53 primed HCC cells to immunotherapy through HDAC inhibition, impaired glucose-regulated transcription, impaired DNA synthesis, upregulated apoptosis, and stimulated the immune response pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the novel HDACi STR-V-53 is an effective anti-HCC agent that can induce profound responses when combined with standard immunotherapy.",0
"Even though both targeted and immunotherapy-based therapies have been established as frontline standard-of-care for patients with advanced lung cancer, adverse events, resistance, and disease progression remain unavoidable in most instances. In this scenario, chemotherapy is a popular salvage option, but it has restricted therapeutic index. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a viable option. ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy to deliver cytotoxic payloads to cancer cells in a direct fashion. Among the promising ADCs used in advanced solid tumors, HER2 targeted ADCs of trastuzumab ematansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan are key drugs in this field.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The introduction of biologics, particularly anti-interleukin (IL) agents, has revolutionized IBD treatment. This review summarizes the role of ILs in IBD pathophysiology and describes the efficacy and positioning of anti-IL therapies. We discuss the functions of key ILs in IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets. The review then discusses anti-IL therapies, focusing primarily on ustekinumab (anti-IL-12/23), risankizumab (anti-IL-23), and mirikizumab (anti-IL-23). Clinical trial data demonstrate their efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The safety profiles of these agents are generally favorable. However, long-term safety data for newer agents are still limited. The review also briefly discusses emerging therapies such as guselkumab and brazikumab. Network meta-analyses suggest that anti-IL therapies perform well compared to other biological agents. These agents may be considered first- or second-line therapies for many patients, especially those with comorbidities or safety concerns. Anti-IL therapies represent a significant advancement in IBD treatment, offering effective and relatively safe options for patients with moderate to severe disease.",1
"Parasites and cancers have some common antigens. Much scientific evidence in the human population, animal models, and in vitro experiments exhibit that parasites have significant anti-cancer effects. The larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzy, Plasmodium’s, and Trichinella spiralis are among the parasites that have been subjects of anti-cancer research in the last decades. Anti-tumor effects of parasites may be due to the direct impact of the parasites per se or indirectly due to the immune response raised against common antigens between malignant cells and parasites. This manuscript reviews the anti-cancer effects of parasites and possible mechanisms of these effects. Options for using parasites or their antigens for cancer treatment in the future have been discussed.Graphical abstract","Cell processing laboratories are an important part of cancer treatment centers. Cell processing laboratories began by supporting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation programs. These laboratories adapted closed bag systems, centrifuges, sterile connecting devices and other equipment used in transfusion services/blood banks to remove red blood cells and plasma from marrow and peripheral blood stem cells products. The success of cellular cancer immunotherapies such as Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells has increased the importance of cell processing laboratories. Since many of the diseases successfully treated by CAR T-cell therapy are also treated by HSC transplantation and since HSC transplantation teams are well suited to manage patients treated with CAR T-cells, many cell processing laboratories have begun to produce CAR T-cells. The methods that have been used to process HSCs have been modified for T-cell enrichment, culture, stimulation, transduction and expansion for CAR T-cell production. While processing laboratories are well suited to manufacture CAR T-cells and other cellular therapies, producing these therapies is challenging. The manufacture of cellular therapies requires specialized facilities which are costly to build and maintain. The supplies and reagents, especially vectors, can also be expensive. Finally, highly skilled staff are required. The use of automated equipment for cell production may reduce labor requirements and the cost of facilities. The steps used to produce CAR T-cells are reviewed, as well as various strategies for establishing a laboratory to manufacture these cells.",1
"Aim: To investigate DNA methylation levels of a panel of genes in thymic epithelial tumors (TETs).Materials & methods: We selected 15 genes among the most promising epigenetic biomarkers of TETs and evaluated their methylation levels in 71 TET samples.Results: thymic carcinomas (TCs) showed hypermethylation of GHSR and ELF3 genes and reduced IL1RN methylation levels compared with thymomas (TMs) and healthy thymic tissues. RAG1 was hypomethylated in TMs compared with healthy thymic tissues. No difference in the methylation levels of the investigated genes was seen among TM stages and subtypes. No changes in blood methylation levels of the investigated genes were seen among TET subtypes.Conclusion: The present study confirms GHSR, ELF3, IL1RN and RAG1 as TET epigenetic biomarkers.","BackgroundMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, and 30% of patients with thymoma often have myasthenia gravis. Patients with thymoma-associated MG (TAMG) have many different clinical presentations compared to non-MG thymoma (NMG), yet their gene expression differences remain unclear.ObjectiveIn this study, we analyzed the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and analyzed their regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) in TAMG, which will further clarify the possible pathogenesis of TAMG.MethodsDEGs were calculated using the RNA-sequencing data of TAMG and NMG downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. R software was then used to analyze the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of DEGs, while STRING was applied to build the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Cytoscape to identify and visualize the hub genes. Immune infiltration significances of hub genes were also explored by using the TIMER database and TCGA database. Upstream microRNAs (miRNAs) of the hub genes were predicted by online software.ResultsWe comparatively analyzed the gene expression differences between TAMG and NMG groups. A total of 977 DEGs were identified between the two groups (|log fold change (FC)| >2, adjusted P value <0.050), with 555 down-regulated genes and 422 up-regulated genes. Five top hub genes (CTNNB1, EGFR, SOX2, ERBB2, and EGF) were recognized in the PPI network. Analysis based on the TIMER and TCGA databases suggested that 5 hub genes were correlated with multiple immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoint-related markers, such as PDCD1, CTLA-4, and CD274, in TAMG patients. Lastly, 5 miRNAs were identified to have the potential function of regulating the hub gene expression.ConclusionOur study identified 5 hub genes (CTNNB1, EGFR, SOX2, ERBB2, and EGF) and their 5 regulatory miRNAs in TAMG, and the hub genes were correlated with multiple immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoint-related markers. Our findings could help partially clarify the pathophysiology of TAMG, which could be new potential targets for subsequent clinical immunotherapy.",1
"Type 2 immune responses play a crucial role in host defense against parasitic infections but can also promote the development of allergies and asthma. This response is orchestrated primarily by group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) and helper type 2 (Th2) cells, both of which undergo substantial metabolic reprogramming as they transition from resting to activated states. Understanding these metabolic adaptations not only provides insights into the fundamental biology of ILC2 and Th2 cells but also opens up potential therapeutic avenues for the identification of novel metabolic targets that can extend the current treatment regimens for diseases in which type 2 immune responses play pivotal roles. By integrating recent findings, this review underscores the significance of cellular metabolism in orchestrating immune functions and highlights future directions for research in this evolving field.","Introduction:Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the treatment landscape for advanced melanoma, but their use in older patients remains understudied. An age-related decline in immune function is of concern when treating older patients because host immune factors can influence clinical outcomes with immunotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ICIs in patients 65 years and older.Methods:Using the SEER-Medicare data, we evaluated survival by first systemic treatment type in a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65 years and older who were diagnosed with stage IV cutaneous melanoma between 2012 and 2015. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.Results:A total of 541 patients were included in this study. Median survival differed significantly between groups (p<0.0001) and was longest in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors (34.0 months), followed by CTLA-4 inhibitors (16.8 months), targeted therapy (9.7 months), chemotherapy (7.1 months), and no systemic therapy (3.6 months). The ICI survival benefit persisted after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, M stage, the presence of brain metastases, and evaluation at an NCI-designated cancer center. Hazard ratios comparing ICIs to no systemic therapy were 0.35 (95% CI: 0.24–0.52) for PD-1 inhibitors and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.37–0.63) for CTLA-4 inhibitors. We did not observe a difference in ICI effectiveness by age group (65–74 vs ≥75).Conclusions:In a nationally representative cohort of patients with advanced melanoma, ICI therapy delivered in a real world setting significantly improved survival in patients aged 65 years and older.",0
"ObjectivesThe presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI) and extranodal extension (ENE) have shown adverse outcomes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study evaluated the impact of LVI, PNI and ENE, individually and in combination, on survival outcomes in OSCC.Material and MethodsA retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained oral cancer database was done from January 2017 to March 2023. All consecutive OSCC patients who underwent curative intent surgery were included. The triple-positive group was defined by the presence of all three features (LVI/PNI/ENE), while the double-positive group had the presence of two features. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) analysis was done between different study groups.ResultsA total of 255 patients were included in the analysis. The LVI, PNI and ENE positivity was 13%, 26% and 11%, respectively. There were 19 patients (7%) with double-positive and ten patients (4%) with triple-positive disease. The triple-positive group had lower DFS than non-triple-positive (0% vs 57%, p-value 0.001) and lower OS (0% vs 72%, p-value 0.003). The median DFS and OS of the triple-positive group were eight months and 24 months, respectively. Similarly, the double-positive group also had statistically significant inferior DFS (p-value 0.007) and OS (p-value 0.002) compared to the single-positive/triple-negative group.ConclusionThe triple-positive disease had poor outcomes, with no patients achieving disease-free or overall survival at the 5-year follow-up. The presence of multiple adverse factors necessitates modification of adjuvant therapy and therapeutic strategy, which may enhance survival outcomes.","PurposeThe CCR5/CCL5 axis is essential for interactions between malignant cells and microenvironment components, promoting tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aims to evaluate the association of CCL5 and CCR5 with the behavior of oral cancer and assess the therapeutic potential of a CCR5 antagonist.MethodsA retrospective study to analyze CCR5 and CCL5 expression on paraffin-embedded tissues was performed. In cell lines, rhCCL5 was added to induce CCR5-related pathways, and Maraviroc and shRNA against CCR5 were used to neutralize the receptor. Finally, an in vivo murine orthotopic xenograft model of tongue cancer was used to evaluate Maraviroc as an oncologic therapy. After 15 days, the mice were killed, and the primary tumors and cervical lymph nodes were analyzed.ResultsThe expression of CCR5 was associated with clinical stage and metastasis, and CCL5 was related to overall survival. Adding rhCCL5 induced cell proliferation, while shRNA and Maraviroc reduced it in a dose-dependent manner. Maraviroc treatment also increased apoptosis and modified cytoskeletal organization. In vivo, Maraviroc reduced neck metastasis.ConclusionsThe effects of CCR5 antagonists in OSCC have been poorly studied, and this study reports in vitro and in vivo evidence for the effects of Maraviroc in OSCC. Our results suggest that the CCR5/CCL5 axis plays a role in oral cancer behavior, and that its inhibition is a promising new therapy alternative.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05443-1.",1
"BackgroundCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a prominent cancer-related complication occurring in Prostate cancer (PCa) patients, profoundly affecting prognosis. The lack of diagnostic criteria and biomarkers hampers the management of CRF.MethodsThe CRF-related data and PCa single-cell data were retrieved from the GEO database and clinical data was downloaded from the TCGA database. The univariate logistic/Cox regression analysis were used to construct the prediction models. The predictive value of models was analyzed using the ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier survival. The hub genes were screened by an intersection analysis of DEGs. The mice model of PCa and PCa-related fatigue were established, and fatigue-like behaviors of mice were detected. The expression of selected hub genes was validated by RT-PCR and IHC analysis.ResultsThe diagnosis and risk models showed great predictive value both in the training and validation dataset. Five genes (Baiap2l2, Cacng4, Sytl2, Sec31b and Ms4a1) that enriched the CXCL signaling were identified as hub genes. Among all hub genes, the MS4A1 expression is the most significant in PCa-related fatigue mice.ConclusionsWe identified MS4A1 as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of PCa-related fatigue. Our findings would lay a foundation for revealing the pathogenesis and developing therapies for PCa-related fatigue.","BackgroundOvarian cancer (OV) is a heterogeneous disease but has traditionally been treated as an immunologically cold malignancy. The relationship between the immune-active cancer phenotype typified by a T helper 1 (Th-1) immune response and clinical outcome in OV remains uncertain.MethodsA cohort-scale compendium of transcriptomic data from 2850 OV samples from 19 individual datasets was compiled for integrative immuno-transcriptomic analysis. The immunological constant of rejection was used as a metric to assess the Th-1/cytotoxic response orientation and investigate the clinical-biological significance of immune polarization towards a Th-1 immune response. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from 39 OV samples were analyzed to elucidate the variability of the immune microenvironment, and immunohistochemical validation was performed on 39 samples from the Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital.ResultsOur results demonstrated the prognostic significance of a Th-1/cytotoxic immune profile within the tumor microenvironment (TME) using the immunological constant of rejection classification to OV samples. Specifically, patients with tumors expressing high levels of ICR markers showed significantly improved survival. A gene panel consisting of four chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL13) was identified as critical players in mediating the establishment of an active T-cell-inflamed antitumor phenotype. This 4-chemokine signature, which was extensively validated in external multicenter cohorts through transcriptomic profiling and in an independent in-house cohort through immunohistochemistry, introduced a novel immune classification in OV and identified a chemokine-dominated subtype associated with an active antitumor immune phenotype and favorable prognosis. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that chemokine-dominated tumors increase CXCR3 + NK and T cell recruitment to the TME primarily through the overexpression of macrophage-derived CXCL9/10/11.ConclusionsThis study provides new insights into understanding immune heterogeneity within the TME and paves the way for tailoring appropriate therapeutic interventions for patients with differing immune profiles.",1
"Introduction:In 2018, durvalumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as consolidation immunotherapy for patients with stage III NSCLC after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, whether durvalumab benefits patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC remains unknown.Methods:We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC who completed concurrent CRT. Kaplan-Meier analyses evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who completed CRT with or without durvalumab.Results:Among 37 patients, 13 initiated durvalumab a median of 20 days after CRT completion. Two patients completed 12 months of treatment, with five patients discontinuing durvalumab owing to progression and five owing to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Of 24 patients who completed CRT without durvalumab, 16 completed CRT alone and eight completed CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Median PFS was 10.3 months in patients who received CRT and durvalumab versus 6.9 months with CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.993). CRT and EGFR TKI was associated with a significantly longer median PFS (26.1 mo) compared with CRT and durvalumab or CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.023). Six patients treated with durvalumab initiated EGFR TKIs after recurrence, with one developing grade 4 pneumonitis on osimertinib.Conclusions:In this study, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC did not benefit with consolidation durvalumab and experienced a high frequency of irAEs. Patients who initiate osimertinib after durvalumab may be susceptible to incident irAEs. Consolidation durvalumab should be approached with caution in this setting and concurrent CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR TKIs further investigated as definitive treatment.","AbstractBackgroundPediatric high-grade gliomas, such as diffuse midline glioma (DMG), have a poor prognosis and lack curative treatments. Current research models of DMG primarily rely on human DMG cell lines cultured in vitro or xenografted into the brains of immunodeficient mice. However, these models are insufficient to recapitulate the complex cell-cell interactions between DMG and the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME), therefore fall short of accurately reflecting how efficacious therapeutic agents or combinations will be in the clinical setting.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed a neuroimmune-competent brain/tumor fusion organoid model system consisting entirely of human cells to investigate the interactions between DMG cells and the primary innate immune cells of the brain, microglia, in the TIME at both cellular and subcellular levels. We generated microglia-containing brain organoids (MiCBOs) that carry morphologically mature, motile microglia and multiple subtypes of neurons to mimic the brain tumor microenvironment. These organoids were then fused with H3K27M mutant, TP53P27R/K132R DMG tumor spheroids to create the MiCBO-tumor fusion (MiCBO-TF) model.ResultsWe utilized live imaging methods to simultaneously track the mobility of microglial cell bodies and the motility of their process, as well as the behavior of tumor cells within a human brain tissue environment. Our MiCBO-TF model faithfully recapitulated the diffuse infiltration pattern of DMG into brain tissue and revealed that microglial mobility and interactions with tumor cells are highly influenced by external factors and the surrounding tissue environment.ConclusionsThe MiCBO-TF model represents a powerful platform for both mechanistic investigations and the development of precision medicine approaches for DMG.",0
"PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.","BackgroundGliomas are the most common highly aggressive primary malignant brain tumors in adults with different biological behaviors and clinically heterogeneous features. About the extremely poor prognosis of gliomas, the search for potential therapeutic modalities and targets is crucial.MethodWe extracted the anoikis-related genes (ARG) from GeneCards and obtained differentially expressed genes in normal and glioma tissues from the GSE4290 dataset to obtain intersect differentially expressed ARG in gliomas by differential analysis. KEGG and GO analyses were used to evaluate the potential pathways and molecular processes of these genes. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training cohort, we performed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and Cox regression to construct an ARG prognostic model and validated them in the TCGA testing cohort and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) validation cohort. Subsequently, we further explored the differences in clinical characteristics, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and the immune microenvironment in the high- and low-risk groups. Univariate and multifactorial regression analyses and nomogram construction were also performed. Moreover, we evaluated the expression levels of key genes via public databases, qPCR analysis and IHC staining, and further assessed the clinical prognostic value.ResultsThe regulatory model based on quantitative ARG prognostic models showed that patients in the high-risk group were associated with poorer survival prognosis, poorer clinical characteristics, and higher TMB levels. Moreover, the high-risk group had high levels of immune infiltration and upregulated immune checkpoint gene expression. The ARG prognostic model and the Nomogram showed good predictive performance. Expression and survival analysis of five prognostic ARG signatures (ETV4, HMOX1, MYC, NFE2L2, and UBE2C) showed that these genes have potential prognostic value.ConclusionOur constructed ARG prognostic risk model provides a potential therapeutic target and theoretical basis for predicting the prognosis of glioma patients and guiding individualized immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05138-7.",1
"Cancer mortality primarily stems from metastatic recurrence, emphasizing the urgent need for developing effective metastasis-targeted immunotherapies. To better understand the cellular and molecular events shaping metastatic niches, we used a spontaneous breast cancer lung metastasis model to create a single-cell atlas spanning different metastatic stages and regions. We found that premetastatic lungs are infiltrated by inflammatory neutrophils and monocytes, followed by the accumulation of suppressive macrophages with the emergence of metastases. Spatial profiling revealed that metastasis-associated immune cells were present in the metastasis core, with the exception of TREM2+ regulatory macrophages uniquely enriched at the metastatic invasive margin, consistent across both murine models and human patient samples. These regulatory macrophages (Mreg) contribute to the formation of an immune-suppressive niche, cloaking tumor cells from immune surveillance. Our study provides a compendium of immune cell dynamics across metastatic stages and niches, informing the development of metastasis-targeting immunotherapies.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) prolong the survival for advanced/metastatic patients with lung cancer or melanoma; however, for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, a durable response has not been reported. Herein, we used a total of 719 HCC patients with public genomic data to determine potential prognostic and immunogenic subtypes. The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method was applied to identify the immune classes and potential subtypes. The proportion of tumor infiltration immune cells was estimated using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was utilized to calculate the dysregulated pathways. By using NMF analysis for the gene expression profile of the top immune genes, one HCC subtype with better survival (that is, low-risk subtype) and another with worse survival (that is, high-risk subtype) were identified in 3 HCC cohorts (all P < 0.05). Better immune cell infiltration, increased enrichment of immune signatures, higher expression of checkpoints, and elevated tumor mutation load (TML) were significantly enriched in the low-risk subtype (all P < 0.05). Higher mutation rates of immune response genes (for example, TP53 and MUC16) were also observed in the low-risk subtype (both P < 0.05). Discovery of the HCC low-risk subtype might provide clues for HCC prognosis and immunotherapy prediction.",0
"Introduction: Colorectal cancer is the second most deadly cancer worldwide. Current screening methods have low detection rates and frequently provide false positive results, leading to missed diagnoses or unnecessary colonoscopies. To tackle this issue, the Wageningen UR iGEM team from 2022 developed “Colourectal”, a living diagnostic tool for colorectal cancer. Following a synthetic biology approach, the project used an engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 strain capable of binding to tumour cells that detects two distinct cancer biomarkers, and secretes a coloured protein observable in stool. Due to the utilization of genetically modified bacteria in vivo, precautionary biosafety measures were included within a three level safe-by-design strategy. Results: The first genetic safeguard ensured confinement of the living diagnostic to the colon environment by implementing auxotrophy to mucin that is abundant in the colon lining. For this, a synthetic chimeric receptor was generated to ensure expression of essential genes in the presence of mucin. The second strategy limited the viability of the engineered bacteria to the human body, preventing proliferation in open environments. The use of a temperature sensitive kill switch induced bacterial cell death at temperatures below 37°C. The third biocontainment strategy was installed as an emergency kill switch to stop the Colourectal test at any point. By inducing a highly genotoxic response through CRISPR-Cas-mediated DNA degradation, cell death of E. coli Nissle is triggered. Discussion: While the use of engineered microorganisms in human applications is not yet a reality, the safety considerations of our multi-layered strategy provide a framework for the development of future living diagnostic tools.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent form of gastrointestinal malignancy with challenges in chemotherapy resistance and side effects. Effective and low toxic drugs for CRC treatment are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death, which has garnered attention for its therapeutic potential against cancer. Baicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is the primary flavone extracted from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis that exhibits anticancer effects against several malignancies including CRC. In this study, we investigated whether baicalein induced ferroptosis in CRC cells. We showed that baicalein (1–64 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of human CRC lines HCT116 and DLD1. Co-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (1 μM) significantly mitigated baicalein-induced CRC cell death, whereas autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (25 μM), necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (10 μM), or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (10 μM) did not rescue baicalein-induced CRC cell death. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the inhibitory effect of baicalein on CRC cells is associated with ferroptosis induction. We revealed that baicalein (7.5–30 μM) dose-dependently decreased the expression levels of GPX4, key regulator of ferroptosis, in HCT116 and DLD1 cells by blocking janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway via direct interaction with JAK2, ultimately leading to ferroptosis in CRC cells. In a CRC xenograft mouse model, administration of baicalein (10, 20 mg/kg, i.g., every two days for two weeks) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth with significant ferroptosis induced by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 axis in tumor tissue. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis contributes to baicalein-induced anti-CRC activity through blockade of the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 signaling pathway, which provides evidence for the therapeutic application of baicalein against CRC.",1
"PurposeProcalcitonin (PCT) is an inflammatory marker elevated in bacteremia and bacterial pneumonia. We aimed to assess the real-world diagnostic accuracy of PCT in hospitalized patients with malignancy.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 715 patients with cancer who had PCT measured during 750 admissions was analyzed. Diagnosis of bacteremia was determined using blood culture data. Diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was based on radiographic infiltrate and/or sputum culture. PCT’s performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and specificity.ResultsPatients had bacteremia, bacterial pneumonia, or both during 210 admissions (28%). PCT elevation above 0.5 ng/mL was significantly associated with diagnosed infection in the overall population (p < 0.0001) and in subgroups with solid tumor malignancies (p < 0.0001) and hematologic malignancies (p = 0.008). PCT was associated with infectious status in patients with any metastases, but not those with primary lung cancer, lung metastases, neuroendocrine tumors, febrile neutropenia, or history of bone marrow transplant (BMT). The area under the ROC curve for PCT in the overall population was 0.655. An ideal cutoff of 0.21 ng/mL led to a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 59%. At cutoffs of 0.5 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, PCT’s sensitivity was 39% and 94%, while specificity was 79% and 17%, respectively.ConclusionIn this large cohort of hospitalized oncology patients, PCT elevation was associated with diagnosed bacteremia and/or bacterial pneumonia. However, specificity was limited, and PCT elevation was not associated with diagnosed infection in some subpopulations. While PCT may have some diagnostic utility for hospitalized oncology patients, values must be interpreted cautiously and considering clinical context.","Background:Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early-stage breast cancer (EBC) is a heterogenous disease. Identification of better clinical and molecular biomarkers is essential to guide optimal therapy for each patient.Patients and methods:We analyzed rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) for patients with HR+/HER2-negative EBC in eight neoadjuvant arms in the I-SPY2 trial by clinical/molecular features: age, stage, histology, percentage estrogen receptor (ER) positivity, ER/progesterone receptor status, MammaPrint (MP)-High1 (0 to −0.57) versus MP-High2 (<−0.57), BluePrint (BP)-Luminal-type versus BP-Basal-type, and ImPrint immune signature. We quantified the clinical/molecular heterogeneity, assessed overlap among these biomarkers, and evaluated associations with pCR and DRFS.Results:Three hundred and seventy-nine patients with HR+/HER2-negative EBC were included in this analysis, with an observed pCR rate of 17% across treatment arms. pCR rates were higher in patients with stage II versus III disease (21% versus 9%, P = 0.0013), ductal versus lobular histology (19% versus 11%, P = 0.049), lower %ER positivity (≤66% versus >66%) (35% versus 9%, P = 3.4E-09), MP-High2 versus MP-High1 disease (31% versus 11%, P = 1.1E-05), BP-Basal-type versus BP-Luminal-type disease (34% versus 10%, P = 1.62E-07), and ImPrint-positive versus -negative disease (38% versus 10%, P = 1.64E-09). Patients with lower %ER were more likely to have MP-High2 and BP-Basal-type disease. At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, patients who achieved pCR had excellent outcomes irrespective of clinical/molecular features. Among patients who did not achieve pCR, DRFS events were more frequent in patients with MP-High2 and BP-Basal-type disease than those with MP-High1 and BP-Luminal-type disease.Conclusions:Among patients with high molecular-risk HR+/HER2-negative EBC, the MP-High2, BP-Basal-type, and ImPrint-positive signatures identified a partially overlapping subset of patients who were more likely to achieve Pcr in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± targeted agents or immunotherapy compared to patients with MP-High1, BP-Luminal-type, and ImPrint-negative disease. I-SPY2.2 is incorporating the use of these biomarkers to molecularly define specific patient populations and optimize treatment selection.",0
"ABSTRACTSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) has been proved to be able to effectively down-regulate gene expression through the RNAi mechanism. Thus, siRNA-based drugs have become one of the hottest research directions due to their high efficiency and specificity. However, challenges such as instability, off-target effects and immune activation hinder their clinical application. This review explores the mechanisms of siRNA and the challenges in siRNA-based tumor therapy. It highlights the use of various nanomaterials – including lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and inorganic nanoparticles – as carriers for siRNA delivery in different therapeutic modalities. The application strategies of siRNA-based nanomedicine in chemotherapy, phototherapy and immunotherapy are discussed in detail, along with recent clinical advancements. Aiming to provide insights for future research and therapeutic approaches.","Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signalling pathway is a crucial path in cancer for cell survival and thus represents an intriguing arget for new paediatric anti-cancer drugs. However, the unique clinical toxicities of targeting this pathway (resulting in hyperglycaemia) difficulties combining with chemotherapy, rarity of mutations in childhood tumours and concomitant mutations have resulted in major barriers to clinical translation of these inhibitors in treating both adults and children.Mutations in PIK3CA predict response to PI3-K inhibitors in adult cancers. The same mutations occur in children as in adults, but they are significantly less frequent in paediatrics. In children, high-grade gliomas, especially diffuse midline gliomas (DMG), have the highest incidence of PIK3CA mutations. New mutation-specific PI3-K inhibitors reduce toxicity from on-target PI3-Kα wild-type activity.The mTOR inhibitor everolimus is approved for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. In paediatric cancers, mTOR inhibitors have been predominantly evaluated by academia, without an overall strategy, in empiric, mutation-agnostic clinical trials with very low response rates to monotherapy. Therefore, future trials of single agent or combination strategies of mTOR inhibitors in childhood cancer should be supported by very strong biological rationale and preclinical data.Further preclinical evaluation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibitors is required. Similarly, even where there is an AKT mutation (~0.1%), the role of AKT inhibitors in paediatric cancers remains unclear.Patient advocates strongly urged analysing and conserving data from every child participating in a clinical trial.A priority is to evaluate mutation-specific, central nervous system-penetrant PI3-K inhibitors in children with DMG in a rational biological combination. The choice of combination, should be based on the genomic landscape for example PTEN loss and resistance mechanisms supported by preclinical data. However, in view of the very rare populations involved, innovative regulatory approaches are needed to generate data for an indication.",1
"AbstractAberrant alternative splicing is emerging as a cancer hallmark and a potential therapeutic target. It is the result of dysregulated or mutated splicing factors, or genetic alterations in splicing-regulatory cis-elements. Targeting individual altered splicing events associated with cancer-cell dependencies is a potential therapeutic strategy, but several technical limitations need to be addressed. Patient-derived organoids are a promising platform to recapitulate key aspects of disease states, and to facilitate drug development for precision medicine. Here, we report an efficient antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO) lipofection method to systematically evaluate and screen individual splicing events as therapeutic targets in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma organoids. This optimized delivery method allows fast and efficient screening of ASOs, for example, those that reverse oncogenic alternative splicing. In combination with advances in chemical modifications of oligonucleotides and ASO-delivery strategies, this method has the potential to accelerate the discovery of antitumor ASO drugs that target pathological alternative splicing.","PurposeThe anti-inflammatory environment of glioma reduces the efficacy of immunotherapies. Therefore, it is vital to transform the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma into a pro-inflammatory environment. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) can serve as immune checkpoint targets that enhance the anti-tumor immune response. However, the roles of Siglecs in the glioma microenvironment are unknown. This study was conducted to identify targets to inhibit the anti-inflammatory environment to improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with glioma.MethodsWe analyzed the regulatory effect of prognosis-related Siglecs identified from data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) and China Glioma Genome Atlas Data portal on the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma. The effects of prognosis-related Siglecs on the glioma microenvironment were investigated by determining the Pearson correlation coefficients of the Siglecs in transcriptome data from the TCGA database.ResultsSiglec-1, -9, -10, and -14 were closely associated with the prognosis of patients with glioma. The expression of these four Siglecs was significantly increased in the high-risk group and positively correlated with anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in the glioma microenvironment.ConclusionOur study provides insights into the effects of prognosis-related Siglecs in glioma immunotherapy, suggesting that targeted prognosis-related Siglecs can modify the microenvironment of glioma and improve the sensitivity of patients with glioma to immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03762-9.",0
"Morreton virus (MORV) is a novel oncolytic Vesiculovirus, genetically distinct from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Herein we report that MORV induced potent cytopathic effects in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro models. In preliminary safety analyses, high intranasal doses (up to 1010 TCID50 ) of MORV were not associated with significant adverse effects in immune competent, non-tumor bearing mice. MORV was shown to be efficacious in a Hep3B hepatocellular cancer xenograft model, but not in a cholangiocarcinoma xenograft HuCCT1 model. In an immune competent, syngeneic murine cholangiocarcinoma model single intra-tumoral treatments with MORV (1 × 107 TCID50) triggered a robust antitumor immune response leading to substantial tumor regression and disease control at a dose 10-fold lower compared to VSV (1 × 108 TCID50). MORV led to increased CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, without compensatory increases in tumor associated macrophages, granulocytic or monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells. Our findings indicate that wild-type MORV is safe and can induce potent tumor regression via immune-mediated and immune-independent mechanisms in HCC and CCA animal models, without dose limiting adverse events. These data warrant further development and clinical translation of MORV as a novel oncolytic virotherapy platform.","AbstractWith the epidemic of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent liver disease in the world. And the dysregulation of the metabolic microenvironment provides a favorable environment for the occurrence of liver cancer. In recent years, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by NAFLD is on the rise, especially in the United States, the UK, and France, where it is the fastest-growing cause of HCC. And due to the absence of disruptive symptoms in the early period and the lack of adequate surveillance in the population without cirrhosis, NAFLD associated-HCC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage with larger tumors and lower cure rates, causing a substantial economic and social burden. Although many factors contribute to the occurrence and development of NAFLD-related HCC, the specific pathogenesis is still unclear. In this review, we focus on the research progress of its pathogenesis in recent years, including the role of insulin resistance, lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, gut microbiota, autophagy, the activation of the immune system, and hormonal disorders.",1
"Aim: Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx (COCO) often exhibit signs of immunosuppression, affecting their prognosis. Understanding the dynamics of humoral immunity in these patients during chemoradiation therapy is crucial for developing effective treatments.Materials & methods: This prospective study included 105 COCO patients undergoing different treatment regimens, with or without alpha/beta-defensins therapy. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, IgA and salivary sIgA were analyzed. Patients were divided into five groups based on treatment protocols.Results & conclusion: Treatment variations impacted serum immunoglobulin levels, notably in Group III, whose patients received radiation treatment and immunotherapy with higher alpha/beta-defensins doses. Significant IgG changes correlated with oral mucositis risk and outcomes. Further trials are necessary for validation and clinical application.","The relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in brain cell types and subtypes remains under-studied. Here, we generated single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the neocortex of 424 individuals of advanced age; we assessed the effect of genetic variants on RNA expression in cis (cis-eQTL) for 7 cell types and 64 cell subtypes using 1.5 million transcriptomes. This effort identified 10,004 eGenes at the cell type level and 8,099 eGenes at the cell subtype level. Many eGenes are only detected within cell subtypes. A new variant influences APOE expression only in microglia and is associated with greater cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, after adjusting for APOEε4, providing mechanistic insights into both pathologies. Further, only a TMEM106B variant affects the proportion of cell subtypes. Integration of these results with GWAS highlighted the targeted cell type and likely causal gene within AD, schizophrenia, educational attainment, and Parkinson’s disease loci.",0
"Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2) has emerged as a significant target in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. The screening of patients positive for CLDN18.2 is crucial for the effective application of targeted therapies specific to CLND18.2. In this study, we developed a novel nanobody-based probe, [99mTc]Tc-PHG102, for use in nuclear medicine. We analyzed its radiochemical yield and stability to ensure accurate probe characterization. Additionally, we assessed the probe’s affinity and specificity toward the CLDN18.2 target and evaluated its efficacy in the BGC82318.2 xenograft model for SPECT/CT imaging of gastric cancer. The binding of [99mTc]Tc-PHG102 to HEK-293T18.2 and BGC82318.2 cells was notably higher than its binding to HEK-293T18.1, HEK-293T, and BGC823 cells, with bound values of 12.87 ± 1.46%, 6.16 ± 0.34%, 1.25 ± 0.22%, 1.14 ± 0.26%, and 1.32 ± 0.07% AD, respectively. The binding ability of [99mTc]Tc-PHG102 was significantly different between CLDN18.2-positive and negative cells (P < 0.001). Imaging results demonstrated a time-dependent tumor accumulation of the radiotracer. Notably, at 0.5 h postinjection, rapid accumulation was observed with an average tumor uptake of 4.63 ± 0.81% ID/cc (n = 3), resulting in clear tumor visualization. By 1 h postinjection, as [99mTc]Tc-PHG102 was rapidly metabolized, a decrease in uptake by other organs was noted. Preliminary clinical imaging trials further confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the probe, indicating specificity for lesions expressing CLDN18.2 in gastric cancer and favorable in vivo metabolic properties. In conclusion, the nanobody-based probe [99mTc]Tc-PHG102 proves to be a safe and effective tool for detecting CLDN18.2 expression levels in gastric cancer tumors and for screening CLDN18.2-positive patients.","Cancer immunotherapy is a major breakthrough in tumor therapy and has been used in monotherapy or combination therapy. However, it has been associated with poor immune tolerance in some patients or immune-related adverse events. Therefore, ideal and reliable tumor elimination strategies are urgently needed to overcome these shortcomings. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a negatively charged phospholipid, usually present in the inner lobules of eukaryotic cell membranes. Under certain physiological or pathological conditions, PS may be exposed on the outer leaflets of apoptotic cells serving as recognition signals by phagocytes and modulating the immune response. On the contrary, increased exposure of PS in the tumor microenvironment can significantly antagonize the body’s anti-tumor immunity, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis. During radiotherapy and chemotherapy, PS-mediated immunosuppression increases the PS levels in necrotic tissue in the tumor microenvironment, further suppressing tumor immunity. PS-targeted therapy is a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy. It inhibits tumor growth and improves the anti-tumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of PS-targeted therapy opens up a new perspective for future cancer immunotherapies.",0
"AbstractBackgroundBrain metastases (BM) portend increased morbidity and mortality in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We aimed to characterize the prevalence, timing, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes of BM associated with SCLC over the past decade.MethodsData from 4014 patients with histologically confirmed SCLC were extracted from the TriNetX Oncology database. Clinical and demographic variables were compared between patients with and without BM using Chi-squared and t-tests. Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate overall survival (OS), after propensity score matching cohorts for age at diagnosis, sex, cancer stage at diagnosis, extracranial metastases, and cancer-directed therapy.ResultsAmong 4014 patients with SCLC, 35.0% had BM (9.9% synchronous, 21.2% metachronous, 3.9% precocious). Patients who developed BM were younger (P < .001) at SCLC diagnosis, more likely Black/African American (P = .0068), and presented with more advanced cancer stages (P < .001) than patients who did not develop BM. The median BM-free survival from the time of SCLC diagnosis was 27.9 months. Patients with BM received higher rates of cancer-directed therapies than those without BM. Synchronous BM was associated with lower OS than metachronous BM after the diagnosis of SCLC (HR[95% CI] = 1.56[1.32–1.83]), but there was no difference in OS after the BM diagnosis. OS did not differ between patients with BM and patients with extracranial metastases only, following the diagnosis of metastatic disease.ConclusionsOur findings support that independently of the chronicity of BM diagnosis, patients with SCLC have poor survival once the diagnosis of BM is conferred.","One of the main challenges in cancer treatment is the selection of treatment resistant clones which leads to the emergence of resistance to previously efficacious therapies. Identifying vulnerabilities in the form of cellular trade-offs constraining the phenotypic possibility space could allow to avoid the emergence of resistance by simultaneously targeting cellular processes that are involved in different alternative phenotypic strategies linked by trade-offs. The Pareto optimality theory has been proposed as a framework allowing to identify such trade-offs in biological data from its prediction that it would lead to the presence of specific geometrical patterns (polytopes) in, for example, gene expression space, with vertices representing specialized phenotypes. We tested this approach in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) transcriptomic data. As predicted, there was highly statistically significant evidence for the data forming a tetrahedron in gene expression space, defining four specialized phenotypes (archetypes). These archetypes were significantly enriched in certain biological functions, and contained genes that formed a pattern of shared and unique elements among archetypes, as expected if trade-offs between essential functions underlie the observed structure. The results can be interpreted as reflecting trade-offs between aerobic energy production and protein synthesis, and between immunotolerant and immune escape strategies. Targeting genes on both sides of these trade-offs simultaneously represent potential promising avenues for therapeutic applications.",1
"PurposeWe determined the clinical relevance of early C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) change in blood as surrogate markers of pro-tumor inflammation (PTI) for predicting clinical outcome of programmed cell death (PD)-1/programmed cell death ligand (PD-L) 1 inhibitor treatment in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. Early CRP change was defined as the ratio of 6 weeks CRP to baseline CRP, and early NLR change was defined as that of the 6 weeks NLR to baseline NLR. PTI index was determined by combinatorial evaluation of early CRP change and early NLR change, PTI index low: both of these were low, intermediate: either of these was low, high; both of these were high.ResultsThe study included 217 patients. Early CRP change and early NLR change were both associated with PFS and OS. The combinatorial evaluation using these two markers enabled the clear stratification of PFS and OS. The median PFS in patient with PTI index low was 13.9 months, while the median PFS in those with PTI index high was 2.5 months (p < 0.01, log-rank test). The median OS in patients with PTI index low was not reached; the median OS in those with PTI index high was only 15.4 months (p < 0.01, log-rank test).ConclusionsThe combinatorial early CRP change and early NLR change as PTI biomarkers have clinical potential in identifying NSCLC patients who can achieve a durable response and long-term survival using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04300-x.","PurposeTP53/EGFR co-mutation has been reported to affect the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, its impact on survival is unclear. In this analysis, we explored the prognostic effect of TP53/EGFR co-mutation in LUAD.MethodsClinical data and transcriptome sequencing of LUAD patients with matched genomic data were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for overall survival (OS) analysis. Differential expression genes (DEGs) were recognized by R software and bioconductor package. Clusterprofiler was used for functional analysis. STRING was used for estimating PPI information and plug-in CytoHubba to screen hub modules in Cytoscape. The association between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and survival was also analyzed.ResultsOS was shorter for patients carrying TP53 mutation (MUT) than that of wild type (WT) (37.7 m vs 52.8 m; p = 0.040, HR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.01–1.89). Dual TP53/EGFR-MUT was associated with inferior OS compared with the dual WT/WT cohort (38.4 m vs 51.9 m; p = 0.023, HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.95–3.52). 316 DEGs between dual TP53/EGFR-MUT and dual WT/WT samples were obtained and functional analysis made known that DEGs were strikingly enriched in regulating the metabolism of important amino acids, cell division, cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix composition. KEGG analysis discovered that DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and extracellular matrix receptor interaction. PPI network suggested that GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY genes were up-regulated in dual mutation samples. OS in the high TMB cohort was significantly better than that in the low TMB in patients with TP53 MUT(43.2 m vs 32.4 m; P = 0.007, HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81), as well as in the combination of TP53 MUT and EGFR WT group (44.4 m vs 31.2 m; P = 0.021, HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 − 0.89).ConclusionsTP53 MUT is a poor prognostic factor in LUAD patients, and the prognosis of TP53/EGFR co-mutation is worse. GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY may be novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for patients with dual TP53/EGFR mutation LUAD.",0
"AbstractWith substantial effects on human health, air pollution has become a major global concern. Air pollution has been linked to numerous gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases with increasing mortalities. The gut and respiratory dysbiosis brought about by air pollution has recently received much attention. This review attempts to provide an overview of the types of air pollutants, their sources, their impact on the respiratory and gut dysbiotic patterns and their correlation with five major diseases including pneumonia, asthma, COPD, lung cancer and irritable bowel syndrome. Deeper insights into the links between pollutants, dysbiosis and disease may pave the way for novel diagnostic biomarkers for prognosis and early detection of these diseases, as well as ways to ease the disease burden.","AbstractAsthma exacerbation is a common clinical occurrence. The causal factors are not fully understood yet. Environmental pollution is linked to asthma exacerbation. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (MNP), an environmental pollutant, in asthma exacerbation. In this study, an airway allergy mouse model was established with ovalbumin as a specific antigen with or without the presence of MNP. The results showed that, in a mouse model, the intensity of airway allergy was significantly increased by exposure to MNP. RNAseq results showed an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated molecules and the Osm expression in airway epithelial cells of mice with airway allergy. Exposure of epithelial cells to MNP in culture induced the expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and ER stress associated molecules. The OSM receptor was expressed by macrophages. OSM could drive macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Inhibition of PERK, one of the key molecules of ER stress, or depletion of OSM receptor in macrophages, could effectively attenuate the MNP/ovalbumin protocol induced airway allergy. To sum up, by promoting ER stress, environmental pollutant MNP can cause airway epithelial cells to produce OSM.

"Due to the high toxicity, poor efficacy and resistance associated with current anti-breast cancer drugs, there’s growing interest in natural products (NPs) for their potential anti-cancer properties. Computational modelling of NPs to identify key structural features can aid in developing novel natural inhibitors. In this study, we developed statistically significant QSAR models based on NPs from the NPACT database, which have shown potential anticancer activity against the MCF-7 cancer cell lines. All the developed QSAR models were statistically robust, meeting both internal (R2 = 0.666–0.669, R2adj = 0.657–0.660, Q2Loo = 0.636–0.638) and external (Q2Fn = 0.686–0.714, CCCext = 0.830–0.847) validation criteria. Consequently, they were utilized to virtually screen a series of NPs from the COCONUT database in the search for novel natural inhibitors. Molecular docking studies were conducted on the identified compounds against the human HER2 protein (PDB ID: 3PP0), which is a crucial target in breast cancer. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that compounds 4608 and 2710 achieved the highest docking scores, with CDOCKER interaction energies of -72.67 kcal/mol and − 72.63 kcal/mol respectively. Compounds 4608 and 2710 were identified as the most promising candidates upon performing triplicate 100 ns MD simulation study using the CHARMM36 force field. DFT studies was performed to evaluate their stability and reactivity as potential drug molecules. This research contributes to the development of new natural inhibitors for breast cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00266-5.","AbstractThe schedule of administering a drug has profound impact on the toxicity and efficacy profiles of the drug through changing its pharmacokinetics (PK). PK is an innate and indispensable component of the dose-schedule optimization. Motivated by this, we propose a Bayesian PK integrated dose-schedule finding (PKIDS) design to identify the optimal dose-schedule regime by integrating PK, toxicity, and efficacy data. Based on the causal pathway that dose and schedule affect PK, which in turn affects efficacy and toxicity, we jointly model the three endpoints by first specifying a Bayesian hierarchical model for the marginal distribution of the longitudinal dose-concentration process. Conditional on the drug concentration in plasma, we jointly model toxicity and efficacy as a function of the concentration. We quantify the risk-benefit of regimes using utility—continuously updating the estimates of PK, toxicity, and efficacy based on interim data—and make adaptive decisions to assign new patients to appropriate dose-schedule regimes via adaptive randomization. The simulation study shows that the PKIDS design has desirable operating characteristics.",0
"PurposeThe CCR5/CCL5 axis is essential for interactions between malignant cells and microenvironment components, promoting tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aims to evaluate the association of CCL5 and CCR5 with the behavior of oral cancer and assess the therapeutic potential of a CCR5 antagonist.MethodsA retrospective study to analyze CCR5 and CCL5 expression on paraffin-embedded tissues was performed. In cell lines, rhCCL5 was added to induce CCR5-related pathways, and Maraviroc and shRNA against CCR5 were used to neutralize the receptor. Finally, an in vivo murine orthotopic xenograft model of tongue cancer was used to evaluate Maraviroc as an oncologic therapy. After 15 days, the mice were killed, and the primary tumors and cervical lymph nodes were analyzed.ResultsThe expression of CCR5 was associated with clinical stage and metastasis, and CCL5 was related to overall survival. Adding rhCCL5 induced cell proliferation, while shRNA and Maraviroc reduced it in a dose-dependent manner. Maraviroc treatment also increased apoptosis and modified cytoskeletal organization. In vivo, Maraviroc reduced neck metastasis.ConclusionsThe effects of CCR5 antagonists in OSCC have been poorly studied, and this study reports in vitro and in vivo evidence for the effects of Maraviroc in OSCC. Our results suggest that the CCR5/CCL5 axis plays a role in oral cancer behavior, and that its inhibition is a promising new therapy alternative.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05443-1.","BackgroundThis study aimed to evaluate the potential role of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) in predicting oncological outcomes and postoperative complications in UTUC patients undergoing radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) and to develop a nomogram incorporating GNRI to predict outcomes.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on 458 consecutive patients who underwent RNU in our center. According to nutritional scores, patients were divided into the following groups: low GNRI (GNRI ≤ 98) and high GNRI (GNRI > 98). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to investigate the role of GNRI in predicting the perioperative complications. The survival was compared with Kaplan − Meier curve, and test by log-rank tests. Risk factors associated with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression model and were integrated into a nomogram for individualized risk prediction. The calibration and discrimination ability of the model were evaluated by concordance index (C-index) and risk group stratification.ResultsWhen compared with high GNRI, low GNRI had significantly lower survival (CSS, p < 0.001; OS, p < 0.001). Across all patients, multivariable analyses revealed that low GNRI was an independent prognostic factor (CSS, p = 0.007; OS, p = 0.005). Nomograms for 1-, 3-, and 5 years of CSS and OS had good performance. Patients can be stratified into different groups based on the nomogram, with significant differences in OS and CSS. Further, GNRI was also found to be an independent risk factor for postoperative complications. The complication − prediction nomogram based on GNRI was also internally validated and showed good performance.ConclusionsThe GNRI score is an independent predictor for the prognosis and postoperative complications of UTUC following RNU. This study presented a nomogram incorporating preoperative GNRI that might be used as a convenient tool to facilitate the preoperative individualized prediction of short- and long-term outcomes for patients with UTUC.",1
"Aim: To develop and characterize doxorubicin-loaded sodium selenite nanoparticles (SSNP-DOX) and their surface attachment with cetuximab (mAb-SSNP-DOX).Methods: SSNP-DOX was formulated by gelation and then conjugated with cetuximab to form mAb-SSNP-DOX. Characterization included DLS, SEM, TEM, DSC, Raman spectroscopy and XRD. In vitro, the kinetics of doxorubicin release and cytotoxicity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells were investigated.Results: The zeta potential for SSNP-DOX and mAb-SSNP-DOX was -14.4 ± 10.1 mV and -27.5 ± 7.28 mV, with particle sizes of 181.3 nm and 227.5 nm, respectively. The formulation intensity was 89.7% for SSNP-DOX and 100% for mAb-SSNP-DOX, with PDI values of 0.419 and 0.251, respectively. SEM and TEM showed that mAb-SSNP-DOX was smooth and spherical. The DSC analysis revealed exothermic peaks at 102.44°C for SSNP-DOX and 144.21°C for mAb-SSNP-DOX, along with endothermic peaks at 269.19°C and 241.6°C, respectively. Raman spectroscopy showed a higher intensity for mAb-SSNP-DOX. The XRD study showed different peaks for each formulation. Both followed zero order kinetics for doxorubicin release. Cytotoxicity studies showed significant effects and high apoptosis in MCF-7 cells for both formulations.Conclusion: The mAb-SSNP-DOX showed promising properties, more effective doxorubicin release and higher cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells compared with SSNP-DOX.","ABSTRACTAcute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous hematopoietic cancer prevalent in adults, has been a leading cause of leukemia-associated deaths for decades.

"AbstractBackgroundPrevious results of our trial demonstrated that the addition of induction chemotherapy (IC) prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) failed to significantly improve the response rate or 3-year survival in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here, we report long-term results and exploratory analyses to further evaluate the therapeutic value of IC.MethodsPatients with previously untreated, unresectable, stage II-IVA ESCC were randomly assigned to receive IC followed by CRT or CRT alone. The relationship between tumor response to IC and long-term survival was analyzed. Baseline tumor biopsies were collected for RNA-Seq to identify patients who may benefit from IC.ResultsEligible patients were randomized to either the IC + CRT group (n = 55) or the CRT group (n = 55). With a median follow-up of 74.9 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 31.8% in the IC + CRT group and 29.1% in the CRT group (P =.675; HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.58-1.43). Similarly, no significant differences were identified in 5-year progression-free survival between groups (30.5% vs 25.5%, P =.508; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.56-1.34). Patients who responded to IC had significantly better survival than nonresponders. A risk-score model incorporating 6 key genes to predict IC efficacy was also constructed.ConclusionsCompared with definitive CRT alone, the addition of IC before CRT still failed to demonstrate superior survival in patients with unselected ESCC, based on long-term follow-up. However, because IC responders were associated with more favorable survival, potential molecular biomarkers were identified for selection of benefit population from IC.Clinical Trials RegistrationNCT02403531.",Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text,1
"IntroductionProteomics technology platforms offer an extremely useful tool for the discovery of new cancer biomarkers. Secreted proteins play important roles in signal transduction, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the molecular signatures of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by quantitative proteomics using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).Material and methodsIn this study, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to analyse the secretome of HCC tissues to identify plasma biomarkers. Serum-free conditioned media (CM) were collected from the primary cultures of cancerous tissues, the surrounding noncancerous tissues, and distal noncancerous tissues.ResultsA proteomic analysis of the CM proteins allowed for a total of 5214 identified proteins, of which 190 and 44 proteins were dysregulated in the HCC tissues/distal noncancerous tissues (HCC/DN group) and the adjacent noncancerous tissues/distal noncancerous tissues (AN/DN group) compared with the distal noncancerous tissues. The dysregulated proteins in the HCC/DN group were concentrated in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling, but the dysregulated proteins in the AN/DN group were more concentrated in the basal material metabolism.ConclusionsThe secretome profile alternations and signalling pathways were associated with HCC incidence and development. The dysregulated proteins in the HCC/DN group were concentrated in the MAPK signalling and JAK-STAT signalling, but the dysregulated proteins in the AN/DN group were more concentrated in the basal material metabolism.","The liver plays a crucial role in immune system regulation, but dysregulation of immunological networks contributes to chronic liver diseases like hepatocellular carcinoma. This malignant tumor is the third leading cause of cancer death. An imbalanced immune system, characterized by alterations in immune cell count, cytokine levels, and inhibitory receptors, can impact metastasis by suppressing the immune system's ability to fight cancer cells. This study aims to investigate the potential biomarkers playing a crucial role in immune dysregulation resulting in hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis. A comprehensive and systematic literature review was conducted using both free words and search terms. The data extraction was then performed by a thorough literature screening. Next, the meta-analysis was performed using the metabin function of the meta library in R to evaluate the patient cases reporting metastasis in the event group. A total of 1,008 cases were considered, with 357 as events and 651 as nonevents. The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated the significant role of biomarkers in immune dysregulation causing metastasis (risk ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.4972, 0.6048, I 2 = 92.4%, p < 0.01). In addition to the immune dysregulation explored in this study, the impact of tumor size on hepatocellular carcinoma progression and metastasis is a crucial consideration. A notable difference of 41 more cases was reported for larger tumor sizes. The study integrates immune dysregulation biomarkers and tumor size factors influencing hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis, offering valuable insights for future research and therapeutic interventions for improved clinical outcomes.",1
"Blockade of the TGFβ signaling pathway has emerged from preclinical studies as a potential treatment to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and several other types of cancer. However, clinical translation of first-generation inhibitors has shown little success. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of HYL001, a potent inhibitor of TGFβ receptor 1 (ALK5), that is approximately 9 times more efficacious than the structurally related compound galunisertib, while maintaining a favorable safety profile. HYL001 in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1) eradicates liver metastases generated in mice by microsatellite stable, aggressive colorectal cancer tumors at doses where galunisertib is ineffective.","AbstractColorectal cancer (CRC) is a major contributor to global cancer incidence and mortality. Conventional treatments have limitations; hence, innovative approaches are imperative.

"PurposeThe effect of immuno-chemotherapy on patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring oncogenic mutations remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the efficacy of immuno-chemotherapy and determine the optimal treatment strategy for such patients.MethodsWe conducted this retrospective cohort study on patients with NSCLC harboring oncogenic driver alterations and treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy at five institutions. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of immuno-chemotherapy for NSCLC with oncogenic mutations in a real-world setting were analyzed.ResultsAmong 846 patients diagnosed with advanced or recurrent NSCLC between April 2017 and April 2021, 43 patients with oncogenic mutations were treated with immuno-chemotherapy. The median age of patients was 68 (range 44–78) years; 42% of patients never smoked, and adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (95%). In patients with KRAS mutations (n = 10) or PD-L1 expression of 50% or greater (n = 10), the disease control rate was 100%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.4, 6.3, and 8.9 months in patients harboring mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and other genes, respectively (P = 0.22). Patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or greater had significantly longer median PFS than patients with PD-L1 expression of less than 50% (16.4 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.001). Two patients experienced grade 3 immuno-related adverse events.ConclusionImmuno-chemotherapy has a clinical benefit and is safe for patients with oncogenic mutations. Notably, patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or more experience greater benefit from immuno-chemotherapy than those with PD-L1 expression of less than 50%.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04125-8.","IntroductionCharacterized by vast heterogeneity, gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. A specific prognostic model is necessary for the improvement of clinical treatment strategies. Hypoxia is a common feature in the tumor microenvironment that promotes tumor progression. However, the current evaluation of the hypoxic tumor immune microenvironment in GC is still inadequate.Material and methodsWith sequence data and single nucleotide variants data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas-STAD dataset as well as hypoxia- and immune-related genes acquired from MsigDB and ImmPort, a hypoxia-immune-based gene signature of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) was built by Cox regression analysis. The risk score could be used as an independent prognostic factor.ResultsThe receiver operating characteristic curve and survival curve showed the accuracy of the model. Pearson correlation analysis showed that DUSP1, one of the hypoxia- and immune-related feature genes, was positively correlated with immune cell scores and immune-related function scores. In addition, low-risk group peers were found to be in higher immune infiltration status and had a higher immunophenoscore as demonstrated by single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), indicating a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment among the low-risk group. q-PCR results showed that DUSP1, IGFBP1, CGB5, GPC3 and EGF were significantly highly expressed in STAD cells, while FAM3D and FGF8 were significantly down-regulated.ConclusionsOverall, our study not only paves the way for future studies focusing on hypoxia and the immune microenvironment but also improves STAD patients’ prognosis and their response to immunotherapy.",0
"Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, a novel anti-tumor strategy, can specifically eliminate tumors by activating the immune system and inhibiting tumor immune escape. However, ICI therapy can lead to notable negative outcomes known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). ICI-induced arthritis, also known as ICI arthritis, stands as the prevailing form of irAEs. The purpose of this review is to highlight the crucial functions of T cells in the progression of ICI arthritis. Under the influence of different signaling molecules, T cells could gather in large numbers within the synovial membrane of joints, releasing inflammatory substances and enzymes that harm healthy tissues, ultimately causing ICI arthritis. Moreover, considering the functions of T cells in triggering ICI arthritis, this review suggests several treatments to prevent ICI arthritis, including inhibiting the overstimulation of T cells at the synovial sac of joints, enhancing the precision of ICI medications, and directing ICI drugs specifically towards tumor tissues instead of joints. Collectively, T lymphocytes play a vital role in the onset of ICI arthritis, offering a hopeful perspective on treating ICI arthritis through the specific targeting of T cells within the affected joints.","Vascular dysfunction has emerged as a significant risk factor for the development of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), which are currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. T lymphocytes (T cells) have been shown to be important modulators of vascular function in primary aging and CVDs, likely by producing inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species that influence vasoprotective molecules. This review summarizes the role of T cells on vascular function in aging, hypertension, and atherosclerosis in animals and humans, and discusses potential T-cell targeted therapeutics to prevent, delay, or reverse vascular dysfunction.",1
"The potential of camel milk-derived exosomes (CMDE) to enhance the bioavailability of Cannabidiol (CBD) was investigated. CBD-CMDE formulation was prepared using an established procedure and its particle size was 138.4 ± 4.37 nm, and CBD entrapment efficiency of 56.56 ± 4.26 %. In-vitro release studies showed release of 78.27 ± 5.37 % and 46.42 ± 4.75 % CBD from CMDE and control CBD formulation respectively in pH 6.8 at 24 hr. The apparent permeability (Papp) of CBD-CMDE was found to be enhanced by 3.95-fold with Papp of 22.9*10−6 ± 0.34 cm/sec as compared to control CBD formulation with Papp of 5.8*10−6 ± 0.65 cm/sec in MDCK cells. CBD-CMDE was found to be more potent than CBD in 2D cytotoxicity assay with IC50 values of 3.6 ± 0.54 μM, 3.88 ± 0.54 μM and 7.53 ± 0.59 μM, 7.53 ± 0.59 μM against Doxorubicin (DOX) resistant MDA-MB-231 and Rapamycin (RM) resistant MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells respectively. Moreover, 3D spheroids assay results demonstrated CBD-CMDE with IC50 values of 14 ± 0.85 μM, 15 ± 0.07 μM as compared to CBD alone with IC50 values of 25 ± 0.93 μM, 34.7 ± 0.08 μM in MDA-MB-231 DOX RT cells and MDA-MB-468 RM RT cells respectively. In-vivo PK studies showed enhanced bioavailability of CBD from CBD-exosomes with AUC(0–24h) of 1350.56 ± 187.50 h.ng/mL as compared to CBD control formulation with AUC(0–24h) of 351.95 ± 39.10 h.ng/mL with a single oral dose of 12 mg/kg. The data indicate that CMDE significantly improved the oral bioavailability of CBD. Overall, CMDE can be used to enhance the oral absorption of poorly bioavailable APIs.","BackgroundTo date, no comprehensive analysis of gallbladder cancer (GBC) management has been reported. We aimed to identify the publication characteristics and research trends in managing GBC over the past three decades.MethodsWe selected the 100 most cited articles and performed a bibliometric analysis to summarize the publication characteristics, explore research hotspots, and identify research trends in the management of GBC.ResultsThe total citations of the included articles ranged from 123 to 1822. Period II (2001–2010) yielded the highest number of included articles, whereas the lowest was in Period III (2011–2020). The United States and Japan published the most papers, in which the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center and Nagoya University were the leading institutions, respectively. The most influential authors were Blumgart LH and Fong YM from the United States. Cooperation among countries, institutions, and authors was weak. The Annals of Surgery contributed the most articles with the highest number of total citations. The most researched topic was surgery, followed by systemic therapy and adjuvant therapy. Since Period I, the percentage of surgery-related publications continuously decreased (Periods II and III versus Period I, both p < 0.001), with a concomitant increase in those of adjuvant therapy (Period III versus Period I, p = 0.004) and systemic therapy (Period II versus Period I, p = 0.004; Period III versus Period I, p = 0.002).ConclusionsSurgery remains the preferred treatment, while there is a tendency toward adjuvant and systemic therapy in GBC management. An increase in local and international collaboration for managing GBC is required.",0
"BackgroundTrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells and many malignant tumor cells. However, data on TROP2 expression in advanced lung cancer are insufficient, and its changes have not been fully evaluated.MethodsWe assessed the prevalence and changes in TROP2 expression in patients with lung cancer who received anti-cancer treatments using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with an anti-TROP2 antibody (clone: SP295). IHC scores were graded from 0 to 3; grade ≥ 2 was considered positive for TROP2 expression. We defined a difference in IHC score, before and after anti-cancer treatments, as the change in TROP2 expression.ResultsBefore anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 89% (143/160) of the patients and was significantly more common in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma than in neuroendocrine carcinoma (P < 0.001). After anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 87% (139/160) of the patients. The distribution of TROP2 expression in post-treatment samples was analogous to that in pre-treatment samples when compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P = 0.509). However, an increase in TROP2 expression was seen in 19 (12%), and a decrease in 20 (13%) patients. Patients treated with targeted therapy showed significantly higher changes in TROP2 expression (P = 0.019) and thoracic radiotherapy was more likely to increase TROP2 expression than chemotherapy alone.ConclusionAlthough some anti-cancer treatments might alter the TROP2 expression, TROP2 was expressed in most lung cancer specimens before and after anti-cancer treatments. These results support the development of TROP2-directed therapy against advanced lung cancer in various treatment lines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03784-3.","BackgroundResistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a pervasive barrier in TKIs therapy for EGFR/ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy has exhibited an encouraging anti-tumor activity in high-selected EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to TKI therapy. However, the effect of ICI plus chemotherapy therapy on those with brain metastases in this subset of patients is still unknown.MethodsFrom April 2019 to August 2021, EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who progressed after previous EGFR/ALK-TKIs with brain metastases and received ICI plus chemotherapy ± bevacizumab at Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) were included. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy, toxicity and progression site after ICI treatment.ResultsA total of 19 patients were included in the study, including 16 (84.4%) patients with EGFR mutations, 2 (10.5%) with ALK translocations and 1 (5.3%) with RET rearrangement. All of the patients progressed after previous TKI therapy and had brain metastatic lesions when received ICI combination therapy. The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 15.8 and 57.9%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.7 months (95% confidence interval CI 0.43–8.96) and 19.2 months (95% CI 15.08–23.29), respectively. The intracranial ORR was 10.5% and extracranial ORR was 15.8%, and the intracranial and extracranial DCR were 68.4 and 63.2%, respectively. The most common progression pattern was extracranial failure, and primary lesions enlargement rather than new sites metastases accounted for the vast majority of progressions. The most common grade 3–4 adverse event (AE) was leukopenia (31.6%), followed by neutropenia (26.3%), thrombocytopenia (10.5%) and rash (5.3%) successively. No grade 5 AE and discontinuation of ICI therapy for severe AEs were observed.ConclusionsICI combined with chemotherapy ± bevacizumab might be effective and safe for EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC patients who progressed after previous TKI therapy, and synergistic anti-tumor activity for brain metastases was also observed.",1
"PurposeLymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) has previously been used as a prognostic predictor in various solid tumors. This research aims in comparing the prognostic predictive Please check and conability of several inflammatory parameters and clinical parameters to validate further the excellent prognostic value of LMR in patients with gastric cancer treated with apatinib.MethodsMonitor inflammatory, nutritional parameters and tumor markers. Cutoff values of the parameters concerned were identified with the X-tile program. Subgroup analysis was made via Kaplan–Meier curves, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to find independent prognostic factors. The nomogram of logistic regression models was constructed according to the results.ResultsA total of 192 patients (115 divided into training group and 77 into validation group) who received the second- or later-line regimen of apatinib were retrospectively analyzed. The optimal cutoff value for LMR was 1.33. Patients with high LMR (LMR-H) were significantly longer than those with low LMR (LMR-L) in progression-free survival (median 121.0 days vs. median 44.5 days, P < 0.001). The predictive value of LMR was generally uniform across subgroups. Meanwhile, LMR and CA19-9 were the only hematological parameters with significant prognostic value in multivariate analysis. The area under the LMR curve (0.60) was greatest for all inflammatory indices. Adding LMR to the base model significantly enhanced the predictive power of the 6-month probability of disease progression (PD). The LMR-based nomogram showed good predictive power and discrimination in external validation.ConclusionLMR is a simple but effective predictor of prognosis for patients treated with apatinib.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04976-9.","AbstractBackground:Neoadjuvant therapy enhances the possibility of achieving radical resection and improves the prognosis for locally advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal extent of resection for locally advanced proximal GC after neoadjuvant therapy.Methods:In this study, 330 patients underwent resection in Peking University Cancer Hospital, with curative intent after neoadjuvant therapy for histologically confirmed proximal GC from January 2009 to December 2022.Results:In this study, 45 patients underwent proximal gastrectomy (PG), while 285 underwent total gastrectomy (TG). After propensity-score matching, 110 patients (71 TG and 39 PG) were included in the analysis. No significant differences between PG and TG regarding short-term outcomes and long-term prognosis were found. Specifically, PG demonstrated comparable overall survival to TG (P = 0.47). Subgroup analysis revealed that although not statistically significant, PG showed a potential advantage over TG in overall survival for patients with tumor-long diameters less than 4 cm (P = 0.31). However, for those with a long diameter larger than 4 cm, TG had a better survival probability (P = 0.81). No substantial differences were observed in baseline characteristics, surgical safety, postoperative recovery, and postoperative complications.Conclusion:For locally advanced proximal GC with objective response to neoadjuvant therapy (long diameter <4 cm), PG is an alternative surgical procedure.",1
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have markedly transformed cancer treatment paradigms but are frequently associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) affecting multiple organ systems. Among the rare and severe complications is the “triple M syndrome”, encompassing myositis, myocarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.We present the case of an 83-year-old male with stage IIc melanoma who received pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy following surgical excision of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes, with no evidence of neoplastic invasion. Approximately one month post-infusion, the patient experienced episodes of syncope, leading to the diagnosis of a second-degree atrioventricular block. Despite normal findings on echocardiography, the patient subsequently developed profound proximal muscle weakness, dysphonia, and dysphagia. Pembrolizumab was promptly discontinued, and the patient was initiated on high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone; however, his clinical course rapidly deteriorated, culminating in the necessity for palliative care due to progressive respiratory failure.This case underscores the potential for severe, life-threatening irAEs associated with pembrolizumab therapy, particularly in the form of triple M syndrome. Notably, the manifestations of myocarditis and myasthenia gravis (MG) within this context may occur in the absence of typical autoantibody markers, thereby complicating the diagnostic process and contributing to poor prognostic outcomes. This case highlights the imperative for heightened clinical vigilance and a proactive approach to monitoring for irAEs in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Early recognition, coupled with the prompt initiation of therapeutic interventions, is paramount in mitigating morbidity and improving clinical outcomes in these critical scenarios.","ABSTRACTCheckpoint inhibitor myocarditis is a rare but life-threatening toxicity of immunotherapy, occasionally manifesting as persistent troponin elevation.

"PurposeRecent studies have revealed that primary tumor resection (PTR) surgery could improve prognosis in some solid tumors. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether patients with stage IVB cervical carcinoma can benefit from PTR surgery and who can benefit.MethodsWe extracted and obtained data on patients with stage IVB cervical carcinoma from the SEER database from 2010 to 2017 and classified them into two groups: the surgery and the non-surgery group. The overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of the two groups were compared before and after propensity score matching (PSM). The independent prognostic variables were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Then, the model was established to select the optimal patients to receive PTR surgery using multivariate logistic regression.ResultsAfter PSM, the study included 476 cervical carcinoma (stage IVB) patients, of whom 238 underwent PTR surgery. Compared to the non-surgery group, the surgery group’s median OS and median CSS were both longer (median OS: 27 months vs. 13 months, P < 0.001; median CSS: 52 months vs. 21 months, P < 0.001). The model showed no organ metastasis, adenocarcinoma, G1/2, and chemotherapy were more supportive of performing PTR surgery. The calibration curves and DCA showed that the model had high predictive accuracy and excellent clinical applicability. Finally, the “surgery benefit” group had the OS that was approximately four times better than “surgery non-benefit” group.ConclusionPTR surgery can potentially improve the prognosis of patients with cervical carcinoma at stage IVB. The model could probably select optimal candidates and provide a new perspective on individualized treatment.","PurposeSelinexor is a novel XPO1 inhibitor which inhibits the export of tumor suppressor proteins and oncoprotein mRNAs, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. While selinexor is currently FDA approved to treat multiple myeloma, compelling preclinical and early clinical studies reveal selinexor’s efficacy in treating hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, including sarcoma, gastric, bladder, prostate, breast, ovarian, skin, lung, and brain cancers. Current reviews of selinexor primarily highlight its use in hematologic malignancies; however, this review seeks to summarize the recent evidence of selinexor treatment in solid tumors.MethodsPertinent literature searches in PubMed and the Karyopharm Therapeutics website for selinexor and non-hematologic malignancies preclinical and clinical trials.ResultsThis review provides evidence that selinexor is a promising agent used alone or in combination with other anticancer medications in non-hematologic malignancies.ConclusionFurther clinical investigation of selinexor treatment for solid malignancies is warranted.",0
"Despite the use of various therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T), the prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still generally poor. However, immunotherapy is currently a hot topic in the treatment of hematological tumors. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) via CD39, and ADP can be converted to adenosine via CD73, which can bind to P1 and P2 receptors to exert immunomodulatory effects. Research on the mechanism of the purinergic signaling pathway can provide a new direction for the treatment of AML, and inhibitors of this signaling pathway have been discovered by several researchers and gradually applied in the clinic. In this paper, the mechanism of the purinergic signaling pathway and its clinical application are described, revealing a new target for the treatment of AML and subsequent improvement in patient prognosis.","Purpose of ReviewAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal blood neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in mitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by novel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluation.Recent FindingsMetabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity to therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial metabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a breakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial complexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting these vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy in preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results limited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on drug combinations with synergistic or additive activity.SummaryIn this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies targeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the specific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to achieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that currently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or are not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells. Thus, further studies of complex metabolic rewiring of leukemia cells before and after combinatorial therapies are warranted.",1
"BackgroundSepsis is a frequent cause of Acute Lung Injury (ALI), characterized by immune dysregulation and a high mortality rate. The role of cuproptosis, a recently discovered cell death mechanism, in sepsis-associated ALI is still unclear. The study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms and immune characteristics associated with cuproptosis in sepsis-associated ALI, with implications for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.MethodsData from the GEO database was utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in sepsis-associated ALI. Gene enrichment analysis, WGCNA, CIBERSORT algorithm, and consensus clustering were employed to investigate the associations between CRGs and immune cells. A predictive model for sepsis-associated ALI was developed based on key CRGs, and its diagnostic accuracy was assessed. Finally, qPCR was employed to validate alterations in the expression of CRGs in the sepsis-associated ALI cellular model.ResultsA total of 14 CRGs were identified in sepsis-associated ALI. Strong correlations between the CRGs and immune cells were observed, and two different CRG subtypes were identified. The expression of immune-related factors in both the CRG and gene clusters exhibited similarities, suggesting a connection between the subgroups and immune cells. The prediction model effectively forecasted the incidence of sepsis-associated ALI based on the expression of CRGs. Finally, qPCR analysis confirmed that the expressions of CRGs in the sepsis-associated ALI cell model closely matched those identified through bioinformatic analyses.ConclusionThe study comprehensively evaluated the complex relationship between cuproptosis and sepsis-associated ALI. CRGs were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence, immune characteristics, and biological processes of sepsis-associated ALI. These findings provide valuable new insights into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-associated ALI.","Purpose The efficacy and lower neurotoxicity of normal brain-sparing radiotherapy (NBS-RT) with systemic therapy in treating multiple brain metastases from non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is underexplored. This study compares whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and NBS-RT for multiple brain metastases in NSCLC, focusing on treatment outcomes and leukoencephalopathy.Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 503 patients with NSCLC with multiple brain metastases at a single center, treated with either WBRT or NBS-RT. Post-RT treatments included chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Main outcomes measured were intracranial control, overall survival (OS), and leukoencephalopathy incidence.Results In this study, 441 patients received WBRT and 62 received NBS-RT, with median ages of 62 and 61 years, respectively. A significant portion of both groups, 77.3% in WBRT and 80.6% in NBS-RT, received post-RT systemic therapy. The median number of brain metastases was 10 for WBRT and 12 for NBS-RT, with median maximal diameters of 11.7 mm in WBRT and 14.4 mm in NBS-RT. After a median follow-up of 10.9 months for WBRT and 11.8 months for NBS-RT, there were no significant differences in intracranial progression (p=0.516) or OS (p=0.492) between the groups. However, WBRT patients had a higher incidence of leukoencephalopathy than NBS-RT patients (p=0.013).Conclusion NBS-RT combined with systemic therapy was as effective in treating multiple brain metastases as WBRT and was less toxic. NBS-RT-based strategies deserve further investigation in a prospective setting.",0
"PurposePolypharmacy is a common problem among older adults. However, its prevalence and impact on the clinical outcomes of anticancer treatment, such as survival and adverse events, in older patients with advanced cancer have not been well investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from Japanese patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 2016 and 2019.ResultsAmong 157 older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients, the prevalence of polypharmacy, defined as ≥ 5 medications, was 59.9% (94/157). The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use, according to the screening tool of older people’s prescription (STOPP) criteria version 2, was 38.2% (60/157). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 3.7 and 5.5 months, respectively (P = 0.0017). The median overall survival (OS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 9.5 and 28.1 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between polypharmacy and OS, but no significant associations between polypharmacy and PFS. Polypharmacy was not associated with immune-related adverse events but was associated with higher rate of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment (59.6% vs. 31.7%, P < 0.001).ConclusionPolypharmacy is an independent prognostic factor in older patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI. Also, polypharmacy could be utilized as a simple indicator of patients’ comorbidities and symptoms or as a predictive marker of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03252-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeDissociated response (DR, reduction at baseline or increase < 20% in target lesions compared with nadir in the presence of new lesions) was observed in 20–34% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). DRs were defined as progression disease (PD) per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1), while evaluation criteria related to immunotherapy incorporated the new lesions into the total tumor burden or conducted further evaluation after 4–8 weeks rather than declaring PD immediately. The main objective of this study is to compare survival between people who continuing initial ICIs treatment and those who switched to other anticancer therapy at the time of DR.Patients and methods235 patients with advanced lung cancer (LC) treated with ICIs were evaluated. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize potential confounding factors. Post-DR OS, target lesion changes were evaluated.Results52 patients had been estimated as DRs. After PSM, the continuing ICIs treatment Post-DR cohort still had a significantly longer median post-DR OS than discontinuing ICIs treatment Post-DR cohort, 10.63 months (95% CI 6.27–NA) versus 4.33 months (95% CI 1.77–NA), respectively (p = 0.016).ConclusionWithin the limitations of this single-center retrospective analysis, clinically stable patients who were judged by clinicians to be eligible for continuing ICIs treatment post-DR derived apparent OS benefit than discontinuing counterpart.",1
"PurposeThe aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical impact of skeletal muscle area (SMA) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors.MethodsUnivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on data of 103 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors. The SMA was measured at the level of the third lumbar vertebral (L3) on computed tomography images using OsiriX software (32-bit, version 5.8; OsiriX, Geneva, Switzerland). The L3 muscle index (cm2/m2) was defined as the SMA (cm2) at the L3 level divided by the height (m) squared.ResultsL3 muscle index Low was an independent predictor of both progression-free (P = 0.0399) and overall survival (P = 0.0155). Moreover, the disease control rate was significantly lower in the L3 muscle index Low group (49.0% [25/51]) than in the L3 muscle index High group (73.1% [38/52]; P = 0.0117). However, there was no significant difference between the response rates of the L3 muscle index Low group (21.6% [11/51]) and L3 muscle index High group (32.7% [17/52]; P = 0.2031).ConclusionsL3 muscle index Low is an independent predictor of worse outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03146-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are often associated with lower urinary tract symptoms, which can severely affect patient quality of life. To address this challenge, we developed and optimized an injectable compound, prostate ablation and drug delivery agent (PADA), for percutaneous prostate tissue ablation and concurrently delivered therapeutic agents. PADA is an ionic liquid composed of choline and geranic acid mixed with anticancer therapeutics and a contrast agent. The PADA formulation was optimized for mechanical properties compatible with hand injection, diffusion capability, cytotoxicity against prostate cells, and visibility of an x-ray contrast agent. PADA also exhibited antibacterial properties against highly resistant clinically isolated bacteria in vitro. Ultrasound-guided injection, dispersion of PADA in the tissue, and tissue ablation were tested ex vivo in healthy porcine, canine, and human prostates and in freshly resected human tumors. In vivo testing was conducted in a murine subcutaneous tumor model and in the canine prostate. In all models, PADA decreased the number of viable cells in the region of dispersion and supported the delivery of nivolumab throughout a portion of the tissue. In canine survival experiments, there were no adverse events and no impact on urination. The injection approach was easy to perform under ultrasound guidance and produced a localized effect with a favorable safety profile. These findings suggest that PADA is a promising therapeutic prostate ablation strategy to treat lower urinary tract symptoms.",0
"AbstractIntroductionIn the phase 3 RESORCE trial, regorafenib prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) whose disease progressed on prior sorafenib. The prospective, observational REFINE study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of regorafenib in a broader population of patients in real-world clinical practice, including patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≥2, Child-Pugh B liver status, and sorafenib intolerance.MethodsThis international, prospective, multicenter study (NCT03289273) enrolled patients with uHCC for whom the decision to treat with regorafenib was made by their physician before enrollment, according to the local health authority-approved label. The primary aim was to evaluate the safety of regorafenib, including the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and dose modifications due to TEAEs.ResultsOf the 1,028 patients enrolled, 1,005 initiated regorafenib and were eligible for analysis. Median age was 66 years (range 21–94); most patients were male (83%), Child-Pugh A (61%), and had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (82%) at study entry. Overall, 47%, 11%, and 40% of patients initiated regorafenib at 160, 120, and 80 mg/day, respectively. Median treatment duration was 3.7 months (range 1 day to 38.9 months). Dose modifications and permanent discontinuation of regorafenib due to TEAEs occurred in 45% and 31% of patients, respectively. The most common drug-related TEAEs were hand-foot skin reaction (31%), diarrhea (26%), and fatigue (15%). Median OS was 13.2 months (95% confidence interval 11.6, 14.8).ConclusionThe results of the real-world REFINE study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of regorafenib in a broad population of patients with uHCC. Of patients who received standard regorafenib dosing in REFINE, safety and efficacy findings were consistent with those reported in the RESORCE trial.","Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is a novel chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer. Although rashes are reported as a common adverse event from this therapy, a paucity of literature is available on dermatologic toxicities to EV, especially with respect to bullous dermatoses. This case report will review a unique bullous dermatosis in the setting of EV therapy, including the diagnostic workup and management. Because cutaneous adverse events to chemotherapy and immunotherapy are common and can often result in dose reduction and treatment withdrawal for cancer patients, awareness of these manifestations and understanding how to manage them is crucial to providing quality care to this patient population.",0
"Adjuvants for vaccines with characteristics of improving adaptive immunity particularly via leverage of antigen presenting cells (APCs) are currently lacking. In a previous work we obtained a new soluble 300 kDa homogeneous β-glucan named GFPBW1 from the fruit bodies of Granola frondosa. GFPBW1 could activate macrophages by targeting dendritic cell associated C-type lectin 1 (Dectin-1)/Syk/NF-κB signaling to achieve antitumour effects. In this study the adjuvant effects of GFPBW1 were explored with OVA-antigen and B16-OVA tumor model. We showed that GFPBW1 (5, 50, 500 μg/mL) dose-dependently promoted activation and maturation of APCs in vitro by increasing CD80, CD86 and MHC II expression. We immunized female mice with OVA in combination with GFPBW1 (50 or 300 μg) twice with an interval of two weeks. GFPBW1 markedly and dose-dependently increased OVA-specific antibody titers of different subtypes including IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, suggesting that it could serve as an adjuvant for both Th1 and Th2 type immune responses. Furthermore, GFPBW1 in combination with aluminum significantly increased the titers of OVA-specific IgG2a and IgG2b, but not those of IgG1, suggesting that GFPBW1 could be used as a co-adjuvant of aluminum to compensate for Th1 deficiency. For mice immunized with OVA plus GFPBW1, no obvious pathological injury was observed in either major organs or injection sites, and no abnormalities were noted for any of the hematological parameters. When GFPBW1 served as an adjuvant in the B16-OVA cancer vaccine models, it could accomplish entire tumor suppression with preventive vaccines, and enhance antitumour efficacy with therapeutic vaccines. Differentially expressed genes were found to be enriched in antigen processing process, specifically increased tumor infiltration of DCs, B1 cells and plasma cells in the OVA plus GFPBW1 group, in accordance with its activation and maturation function of APCs. Collectively, this study systematically describes the properties of GFPBW1 as a novel potent and safe adjuvant and highlights its great potential in vaccine development.","IntroductionThe regulatory role of miR-182 in breast cancer malignancy and macrophage reprogramming is well established. However, the mechanisms through which miR-182 overexpression in tumor cells influences macrophage polarization remain elusive.Material and methodsAfter transfection with miR-182-5p mimics, inhibitors, and controls for 24 h, exosomes were extracted by differential centrifugation from transfected MDA-MB-231. Macrophages were co-cultured with these exosomes to illustrate the regulative effects of exo-miR-182-5p reprogram macrophage. Furthermore, breast cancer cells were co-cultured with exo-miR-182-5p reprogrammed M2 macrophages to demonstrate the effects of reprogrammed M2 macrophages to influence breast cancer progression. After all, these findings were validated in a cell-derived xenograft (CDX) BALB/C nude-mouse model.ResultsThis study demonstrated that exosome-derived miR-182-5p from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells reprograms M2 macrophage polarization through direct combination with Notch1, thereby enhancing breast cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. When co-cultured with exosomes from TNBC cells transfected with miR-182-5p mimics or inhibitors, macrophages showed altered Notch1/Hes1 pathway expression, leading to M2 polarization and subsequent changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation, and other biochemical markers. Furthermore, breast cancer cells co-cultured with exosome-reprogrammed macrophages exhibited increased colony formation, migration, and invasion, as well as reduced apoptosis. These findings were validated in a BALB/C nude-mouse model.ConclusionsThis study pioneers the elucidation of the feedback loop mechanism between breast cancer cells and macrophages mediated by the exosome-derived miR-182-5p/Notch1 pathway, highlighting its role in macrophage reprogramming. Although the therapeutic application of miR-182-5p inhibitors as anticancer agents remains in the early stages, targeting macrophage polarization represents a promising avenue for breast cancer therapy.",0
"BackgroundThe optimal timing of transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still under debate regarding the tumor biology and locoregional control with various treatments. We designed this study to find out what kind of factors affect the post-transplantation outcome focusing on the timing of transplantation.MethodsWe analyzed HCC patients who met the Milan criteria at the initial stage and subsequently underwent liver transplantation (LT) between 2007 and 2020. We examined the number of locoregional therapies (LRTs) received, as well as data on tumor recurrence and survival. The number of LRTs was categorized into four groups: none, one or two, three or four, and five or more. Both recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed.ResultsA total of 423 patients who met the Milan criteria at the initial stage underwent LT. The median number of LRTs before transplantation was 2, with an interquartile range of 0 to 4. There were 112 patients (26.5%) who underwent LT as the initial treatment. Multivariable Cox analyses showed that the number of LRTs [hazard ratio (HR) =1.219, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.074–1.382, P=0.002] was a significant factor for recurrence. When analyzed as a categorical variable, three or four LRTs (HR =4.936, 95% CI: 1.790–13.615, P=0.002) and five or more LRTs (HR =5.129, 95% CI: 1.958–13.440, P=0.001) showed a significantly higher risk compared to the primary transplantation group.ConclusionsThis study showed that the risk of recurrence after transplantation increases with the increasing number of LRTs prior to LT. Therefore, optimal timing of LT should be cautiously decided in regards of recurrence potential of each patient.","BackgroundThe treatment situation for hepatocellular carcinoma remains critical. The use of deep learning algorithms to assess immune infiltration is a promising new diagnostic tool.MethodsPatient data and whole slide images (WSIs) were obtained for the Xijing Hospital (XJH) cohort and TCGA cohort. We wrote programs using Visual studio 2022 with C# language to segment the WSI into tiles. Pathologists classified the tiles and later trained deep learning models using the ResNet 101V2 network via ML.NET with the TensorFlow framework. Model performance was evaluated using AccuracyMicro versus AccuracyMacro. Model performance was examined using ROC curves versus PR curves. The percentage of immune infiltration was calculated using the R package survminer to calculate the intergroup cutoff, and the Kaplan‒Meier method was used to plot the overall survival curve of patients. Cox regression was used to determine whether the percentage of immune infiltration was an independent risk factor for prognosis. A nomogram was constructed, and its accuracy was verified using time-dependent ROC curves with calibration curves. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess immune infiltration between groups. Gene Ontology was used to explore the pathways of differentially expressed genes.ResultsThere were 100 WSIs and 165,293 tiles in the training set. The final deep learning models had an AccuracyMicro of 97.46% and an AccuracyMacro of 82.28%. The AUCs of the ROC curves on both the training and validation sets exceeded 0.95. The areas under the classification PR curves exceeded 0.85, except that of the TLS on the validation set, which might have had poor results (0.713) due to too few samples. There was a significant difference in OS between the TIL classification groups (p < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in OS between the TLS groups (p = 0.294). Cox regression showed that TIL percentage was an independent risk factor for prognosis in HCC patients (p = 0.015). The AUCs according to the nomogram were 0.714, 0.690, and 0.676 for the 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year AUCs in the TCGA cohort and 0.756, 0.797, and 0.883 in the XJH cohort, respectively. There were significant differences in the levels of infiltration of seven immune cell types between the two groups of samples, and gene ontology showed that the differentially expressed genes between the groups were immune related. Their expression levels of PD-1 and CTLA4 were also significantly different.ConclusionWe constructed and tested a deep learning model that evaluates the immune infiltration of liver cancer tissue in HCC patients. Our findings demonstrate the value of the model in assessing patient prognosis, immune infiltration and immune checkpoint expression levels.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05097-z.",1
"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer (PC). Tryptophan oxidative catabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) cleaves the indole ring to kynurenine (Kyn), an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which activates multiple tumorigenesis pathways. The IDO1-Kyn-AhR axis is aberrantly dysregulated in mCRPC. (−)-Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid. CBD showed antitumor activities against human malignancies, including PC. CBD showed potent in vitro dose-dependent reduction of viability and clonogenicity of diverse human PC cell lines. CBD reduced the expression of IDO1 and AhR in PC cells. A daily 15 mg/kg oral dose of CBD for 30 days effectively suppressed the progression of the mCRPC CWR-R1ca-Luc cells xenografted in male nude mice. Continued CBD oral dosing for an additional 45 days suppressed the CWR-R1ca-Luc tumor locoregional and distant recurrences after the primary tumors’ surgical excision. Collected CBD-treated tumors showed a reduced level of IDO1 expression. CBD-treated mice displayed a significant systemic reduction of Kyn. CBD is a novel, nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid lead useful for the control of mCRPC via targeting the tryptophan catabolism.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown limited success in patients with solid tumors. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have shown that adrenoceptor beta-2 (ADRB2) is a novel checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. To inhibit ADRB2-mediated inhibitory signaling, we downregulated ADRB2 in CAR-T (shβ2-CAR-T) cells via RNA interference, assessed different parameters, and compared them with conventional second-generation CAR-T cells. ADRB2 knockdown CAR-T cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, by increasing CD69, CD107a, GzmB, IFN-γ, T-bet, and GLUT-1. In addition, ADRB2 deficiency led to improved proliferation, increased CD8/CD4 T cell ratio, and decreased apoptosis in CAR-T cells. shβ2-CAR-T cells expressed more Bcl-2 and led to the generation of more significant proportions of T central memory cells. Finally, the ZAP-70/NF-κB signaling axis was shown to be responsible for the improved functions of novel CAR-T cells. In tumor-bearing mice, shβ2-CAR-T cells performed better than conventional CAR-T cells in eradicating prostate tumors. The study provides the basis for future clinical and translational CAR-T cell research to focus on adrenergic stress-mediated challenges in the tumor microenvironment of stressed tumors.",1
"AbstractBackgroundStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with brain metastases (BM) is associated with a risk of distant intracranial failure (DIF). This study evaluates the impact of integrating dedicated 3D fast/turbo spin echo (3D-TSE) sequences to MPRAGE in BM detection and DIF prolongation in a histology-agnostic patient cohort.MethodsThe study population included adults treated with SRS from February 2019 to January 2024 who underwent MPRAGE alone or dual sequence with the addition of 3D-TSE starting from February 2020. Median times to DIF were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method.ResultsThe 216 study patients who underwent 332 SRS courses for 1456 BM imaged with MPRAGE and 3D-TSE (primary cohort) were compared to a control cohort (92 patients, 135 SRS courses, 462 BM). In the session-wise analysis, the median time to DIF between the cohorts was significantly prolonged in the primary vs. control cohorts (11.4 vs. 6.8 months, P = .029), more pronounced in the subgroups with 1–4 metastases (14.7 vs. 8.1 months, P = .008) and with solitary BM (36.4 vs. 10.9 months, P = .001). While patients relapsing on immunotherapy or targeted therapy did not significantly benefit from 3D-TSE (7.2 vs. 5.7 months, P = .280), those who relapsed on chemotherapy or who were off systemic therapy (including synchronous metastases) exhibited a trend toward longer time to DIF with 3D-TSE integration (14.7 vs. 7.9 months, P = .057).ConclusionsImplementing 3D-TSE sequences into SRS practice increases BM detection across all patients and translates into clinical relevance by prolonging time to DIF, particularly in those with limited intracranial disease and those not receiving central nervous system-active agents.","AbstractBackgroundBrain metastases (BM) portend increased morbidity and mortality in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We aimed to characterize the prevalence, timing, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes of BM associated with SCLC over the past decade.MethodsData from 4014 patients with histologically confirmed SCLC were extracted from the TriNetX Oncology database. Clinical and demographic variables were compared between patients with and without BM using Chi-squared and t-tests. Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate overall survival (OS), after propensity score matching cohorts for age at diagnosis, sex, cancer stage at diagnosis, extracranial metastases, and cancer-directed therapy.ResultsAmong 4014 patients with SCLC, 35.0% had BM (9.9% synchronous, 21.2% metachronous, 3.9% precocious). Patients who developed BM were younger (P < .001) at SCLC diagnosis, more likely Black/African American (P = .0068), and presented with more advanced cancer stages (P < .001) than patients who did not develop BM. The median BM-free survival from the time of SCLC diagnosis was 27.9 months. Patients with BM received higher rates of cancer-directed therapies than those without BM. Synchronous BM was associated with lower OS than metachronous BM after the diagnosis of SCLC (HR[95% CI] = 1.56[1.32–1.83]), but there was no difference in OS after the BM diagnosis. OS did not differ between patients with BM and patients with extracranial metastases only, following the diagnosis of metastatic disease.ConclusionsOur findings support that independently of the chronicity of BM diagnosis, patients with SCLC have poor survival once the diagnosis of BM is conferred.",1
"ObjectivesPrior researches indicate that peripheral blood CD4 levels have an inverse correlation with distant tumor metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the linear relationship between CD4 and distant metastasis lacks clarity. Hence, the objective of this study was to ascertain the linear relationship between CD4 and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients.MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed clinical and laboratory data of NSCLC patients between March 2016 and July 2022 at the Cancer Hospital of Anhui University of Technology. The study first applied a generalized summation model and smoothing curve fitting to determine if there was a linear relationship between CD4 and NSCLC metastasis. Secondarily, univariate logistic analysis and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the odds ratio (OR) of CD4 as a continuous variable, dichotomous variable, and trichotomous variable when predicting NSCLC metastasis. In addition, stratified and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the reliability of CD4 in different NSCLC patient populations.ResultsThe study included a total of 213 NSCLC patients, among which 122 had distant metastasis and 91 had no metastasis. The smoothing curve fitting analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between CD4 and NSCLC metastasis with a threshold effect. The univariate logistic analysis indicated that continuous CD4 expression was not significantly associated with NSCLC metastasis (P = 0.051); however, high levels of CD4 expression (≥ 35.06%) were found to be a protective factor against NSCLC metastasis when CD4+ T was a dichotomous variable (OR = 0.49, P = 0.010). Furthermore, multivariate linear regression models showed that low (< 32%) or high levels (> 44%) of CD4 significantly increased the risk of NSCLC metastasis compared to medium levels (32–44%) when CD4+ T was trichotomized. The significance was maintained in stratified analysis in relation to age, sex, type of pathology, smoke, PS, and T stage. CD4 levels were U-shaped in relation to different sites of distant metastases (bone, brain, liver), but not with lung metastases.ConclusionsA threshold effect is shown to exist between the peripheral blood CD4 and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients. It was revealed that the risk of distant metastasis is lower when CD4 is maintained between 32 and 44%, whereas low (< 32%) or high (> 44) levels of CD4 are associated with an increased risk of distant metastasis in NSCLC patients.","PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) targeted therapies may be useful for several cancers. The use of non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic molecular imaging platforms could improve clinical assessment of PD-L1 tumor status during these therapies. Contrast enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging (CE-USMI) techniques may offer versatile and cost-effective ways to detect and quantify the expression levels of cellular targets in vivo. However, conventional use of microbubbles as a blood pool contrast agent for CE-USMI is limited to accessing intravascular biomarkers rather than reflecting the tumor molecular status. Using a microfluidic based reconstruction process we therefore developed ultra-stable nanobubbles (NBs) as a contrast agent for molecular imaging of vascular and extravascular cell surface markers. We then functionalized these NBs by covalently linking to nanobody (FN3hPD-L1) targeting human (h)PD-L1 to measure the expression of human PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo. We showed the specific binding of hPD-L1 targeted NBs in cell culture, and in xenografted mouse models of hPD-L1 expressing CT26 tumors. CE-USMI of hPD-L1 in the TME in vivo showed ~3-fold increase in contrast signal compared to non-targeted NBs. Overall, in vivo use of CE-USMI with hPD-L1 targeted NBs has the potential for clinical translation and imaging of human cancers during immunotherapy, and for prognostic evaluation of patient response to PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy.",0
"AbstractNecroptosis, a cell death mechanism with the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. Induction of necroptosis for cancer therapy may be possible through the regulation of the expression of a key factor gene receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3 (RIPK3) via in vitro transcription (IVT) mRNA delivery. However, mRNA is susceptible to degradation and has a low delivery efficiency, which highlights the requirement of a proper delivery vehicle for intracellular delivery. Therefore, a new mRNA delivery system based on the nanostructured silica nanoparticles, termed mRNA‐protective nanocage (mPN) has been developed. High‐efficiency expression of RIPK3 and induction of necroptosis is achieved through delivery of RIPK3 IVT mRNA with mPN in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, the mPN carrying RIPK3 mRNA distributed locally in tumors upon intravascular injection, and successfully induced necroptosis and immune cell infiltration, a hallmark of necroptosis. the suppression of tumor growth in a murine cancer model, demonstrating the synergistic effect of RIPK3 mRNA‐ and immune cell‐mediated therapy is also observed. These findings suggest the potential for anticancer therapy through necroptosis induction and provide a strategy for the development of mRNA‐based nanomedicine.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is increasingly recognized as a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third-leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, driven by the global obesity epidemic. Projected to become the primary cause of HCC by 2030, MASH-HCC presents unique clinical challenges. This review examines its clinical management, including surveillance strategies and treatment advances, and discusses prospects to overcome existing challenges. MASH-HCC accounts for 10%–20% of HCC cases, particularly in Western countries, with a rising incidence due to obesity. Risk factors include cirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, alcohol, smoking, genetic polymorphisms (for example, PNPLA3), and microbiome alterations. The pathogenesis involves fibrosis, immune dysfunction (for example, T-cell impairment), and molecular changes. Prevention focuses on lifestyle modifications. Surveillance in patients with MASH cirrhosis is crucial but is hindered by poor ultrasound sensitivity in obese patients, necessitating alternative methods. Treatment mirrors that of other HCC types, but comorbidities and potentially reduced efficacy of immunotherapy necessitate tailored approaches. MASH is becoming the leading cause of HCC, necessitating lifestyle interventions for prevention. Improved surveillance and early detection are critical but challenging due to obesity-related factors. Treatments align with those for other HCC types, but comorbidities and potential differences in immunotherapy efficacy due to T-cell dysfunction require careful consideration. Key needs include identifying molecular drivers in non-cirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, developing preventive therapies, refining surveillance methods, and tailoring treatments. Trials should specifically report MASH-HCC outcomes to enable personalized therapies. Further research is needed to understand T-cell dysfunction, optimize immunotherapies, and identify predictive biomarkers.",0
"PurposeThere is not much progress in the treatment for lung squamous cell carcinoma LSCC in the past few years. Rapamycin Rapa, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR, has exhibited antitumor efficacy in a variety of malignant tumors. It has recently been reported that Rapamycin can induce autophagy signaling pathway in lung cancer and Glypican-3GPC3 can promote the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by stimulating canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of rapamycin’s antitumor efficacy in relation to GPC3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy in LSCC.MethodsSK-MES-1 cells, a LSCC cell line, were treated with various concentrations of rapamycin with or without Glypican-3 GPC3-targeting siRNA. SK-MES-1 cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Protein expression levels of GPC3, β-catenin, Beclin-1 were checked via western blotting. We established the xenograft mice model to investigate the suppression effect of rapamycin on LSCC. In addition, we further testified the metabolism protein of autophagy process using the xenograft tumor tissue. ResultsRapamycin could inhibit the SK-MES-1 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the GPC3 expression and downregulating the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we found that GPC3 silencing can activate the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy, which contribute to the suppression of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionRapamycin suppresses the growth of lung cancer through down-regulating glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which mediates with activation of autophagy. This study suggests GPC3 is a new promising target for rapamycin in the treatment of lung cancer.","ABSTRACTThe host ESCRT-machinery repairs damaged endolysosomal membranes. If damage persists, selective macroautophagy/autophagy clears the damaged compartment. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that damages the phagosomal membrane and targets ESCRT-mediated repair as part of its virulence program. The E3 ubiquitin ligases PRKN and SMURF1 promote autophagic capture of damaged, Mtb-containing phagosomes. Because ubiquitination is a reversible process, we anticipated that host deubiquitinases (DUBs) would also be involved. Here, we screened all predicted mouse DUBs for their role in ubiquitin targeting and control of intracellular Mtb. We show that USP8 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 8) colocalizes with intracellular Mtb, recognizes phagosomal membrane damage, and is required for ESCRT-dependent membrane repair. Furthermore, we show that USP8 regulates the NFE2L2/NRF2-dependent antioxidant signature. Taken together, our study demonstrates a central role of USP8 in promoting Mtb intracellular growth by promoting phagosomal membrane repair, limiting ubiquitin-driven selective autophagy, and reducing oxidative stress.Abbreviation: BMDMs: bone marrow-derived macrophages; CFUs: colony-forming units; DUB: deubiquitinase; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; LLOMe: L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester; MFI: mean fluorescence intensity; MOI: multiplicity of infection; Mtb: Mycobacterium tuberculosis; NFE2L2/NRF2: nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; PMA: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ROS: reactive oxygen species; USP8: ubiquitin specific peptidase 8",1
"Introduction:Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown great promise in a wide spectrum of malignancies. However, responses are not always durable, and this mode of treatment is only effective in a subset of patients. As such, there exists an unmet need for novel approaches to bolster ICI efficacy.Areas covered:We review the role of the Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinases in promoting tumor-induced immune suppression and discuss the benefits that may be derived from combining ICI with TAM kinase-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We searched the MEDLINE Public Library of Medicine (PubMed) and EMBASE databases and referred to ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant ongoing studies.Expert Opinion:Targeting of TAM kinases may improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. However, it remains to be determined whether this effect will be better achieved by the selective targeting of each TAM receptor, depending on the context, or by multi-receptor TAM inhibitors. Triple inhibition of all TAM receptors is more likely to be associated with increased risk for adverse events. Clinical trial designs should use high resolution clinical endpoints and proper control arms to determine the synergistic effects of combining TAM inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade.","A 69-year-old woman with left-sided breast cancer developed elevated creatine kinase levels and muscle weakness in her extremities after treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient was diagnosed with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related myositis. Although the patient had no symptoms of dysphagia, we evaluated her swallowing function because esophageal dysfunction is a known complication of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study detected barium residues in the lower esophagus. Furthermore, high-resolution manometry showed impaired upper esophageal sphincter opening and absence of esophageal peristalsis, which improved partially after immunotherapy. These findings suggest that esophageal dysfunction may be an unrecognized complication of ICI-related myositis.",0
"Chronic systemic inflammation significantly increases myocardial infarction risk in people living with HIV (PLWH). Endothelial cell dysfunction disrupts vascular homeostasis regulation, increasing the risk of vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis, contributing to cardiovascular disease. We aimed to characterize endothelial cell (EC) chemokines, cytokine and chemokine receptors of PLWH, hypothesizing that in our cohort, glucose intolerance contributes to their differential expression implicated in endothelial dysfunction. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we phenotyped chemokine, chemokine, and cytokine receptor expression on arterial ECs, capillary ECs, venous ECs, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 59 PLWH with and without glucose intolerance. Our results show that arterial and capillary ECs express significantly higher interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors than venous ECs and VSMCs. Venous ECs exhibited more interleukin (IL)1R1 and ACKR1 receptors, and VSMCs showed significant IL6R expression than arterial and capillary ECs. When stratified by group, arterial ECs from PLWH with glucose intolerance expressed significantly higher IL1R1, IL6R, CXCL12, CCL14, and ICAM2 transcripts than arterial ECs from PLWH without diabetes. Of the different vascular cell types studied, arterial ECs as a proportion of all ECs in adipose tissue were positively correlated with plasma fasting blood glucose. In contrast, venous ECs and VSMCs were positively correlated with plasma IL6. To directly assess the effect of plasma from PLWH on endothelial function, we cultured human arterial ECs (HAECs) in plasma-conditioned media from PLWH and performed bulk RNA sequencing. Plasma from PLWH stimulated ECs with the upregulation of genes that enrich for the oxidative phosphorylation and the TNF-α via NFK-β pathways. In conclusion, ECs in PLWH show heterogeneous cytokine and chemokine receptor expression, and arterial ECs were the most influenced by glucose intolerance. Further research must explicate cytokine and chemokine roles in EC dysfunction and identify biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",1
This case report highlights a rare case of renal cell carcinoma metastasis to nose and paranasal sinuses in a 55-year-old male 8 years post-nephrectomy. Contrast imaging revealed a vascular mass and histopathology confirmed metastatic RCC. Partial maxillectomy was done and patient remained disease free at 6 month follow up.,"BackgroundIn CLEAR, lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (L+P) significantly improved efficacy versus sunitinib in first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We report results from CLEAR biomarker analyses.MethodsPD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing assays (whole exome sequencing/RNA-sequencing) were performed on archival tumor specimens.For IHC-derived/RNA-sequencing analyses, a continuous analysis was performed adjusting by Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score for: PD-L1 CPS versus best overall response (BOR)/PFS; and each gene-signature score (T-cell inflamed gene-expression profile [TcellinfGEP]/non-TcellinfGEP signatures including proliferation and angiogenesis) versus BOR/PFS.Association between mutation status of RCC driver genes and PFS were analyzed for genes for which ≥20 patients per arm had oncogenic alterations. Association of molecular subtypes with outcome was evaluated with baseline KPS adjustments. The set of biomarkers evaluated and statistical significance criteria for PD-L1 CPS, gene signature scores, and molecular subtypes were pre-specified.ResultsWithin-arm analyses using continuous values showed no association between PD-L1 levels and BOR/PFS for either treatment.PFS hazard ratios between arms were similar regardless of mutant or wildtype subgroups of RCC driver genes (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, KDM5C).No associations between PFS and gene-signature scores were observed for L+P. With sunitinib, high proliferation and MYC signature scores showed shorter PFS; high angiogenesis and microvessel density signature scores showed longer PFS.Six new molecular subtypes were defined. Tumors of patients with favorable/intermediate risk were enriched in angiogenesis and angiogenesis/stromal clusters; those with poor risk were enriched in proliferative and unclassified (low-TcellinfGEP/low-angiogenesis/low-proliferation) clusters. No association between molecular subtypes and PFS for L+P/sunitinib was observed (after adjustment for KPS and gene signatures that were individually associated with PFS).ConclusionsImprovements in ORR and PFS for L+P versus sunitinib in aRCC were observed consistently across a range of biomarker subgroups defined using RCC driver mutations, PD-L1, gene expression signatures, and molecular subtypes.",1
"PurposeTo construct a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients base on HCC-GRIm score.MethodsClinical cases of HCC patients diagnosed at Hunan Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital were included, and these were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 219) and the validation cohort (n = 94), and those patients were divided into low GRIm-Score group (scores 0, 1, and 2) and high GRIm-Score group (scores 3, 4, and 5). In the training cohort, independent risk factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed by independent risk factors. The efficiency and the clinical applicability of nomograms were evaluated using ROC curves, calibration plot, and the decision curve (DCA), and the patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups according to total score of nomogram.ResultsCompared to low HCC-GRIm score group, high HCC-GRIm score group with BCLC stage is more advanced (P < 0.001), and fewer patients received TACE (P = 0.005) and surgical treatment (P = 0.001). There was higher rate of the presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis screened 4 independent risk factors to construct a nomogram of HCC patients, including HCC-GRIm score, BCLC stage, albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), and glutamyl trans-peptidase (GGT). The consistency index (C-index) of the nomogram of the training was 0.843 (0.832–0.854) and the validation was 0.870 (0.856–0.885). The time-dependent parameter showed the AUC values of the training cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.954 (95% CI 0.929–0.980), 0.952 (95% CI 0.919–0.985), and 925 (95% CI 0.871–0.979), while the AUC values of validation cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.974 (95% CI 0.950–0.998), 0.965 (95% CI 0.931–0.999), and 0.959 (95% CI 0.898–1.021). The calibration plot showed the nomogram fits well onto perfect curves, and the DCA curve showed the net benefit of the nomogram at a certain probability threshold is significantly higher than the net benefit of the BCLC stage at the same threshold probability. Finally, all patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups based on the total score of nomogram, and it showed effectively to identify high-risk patients.ConclusionThe nomogram constructed by the independent risk factors can predict the prognosis of HCC patients, providing an effective tool with clinical workers to evaluate the prognosis and survival time of HCC patients.","AbstractBackgroundAdjuvant modified leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) is standard of care for fit individuals with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Data are limited on adjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX outcomes outside clinical trials.MethodsWe queried institutional databases to identify patients with resected PDAC who received 1 or more doses of adjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX. Primary endpoints were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival. Secondary endpoints were clinical factors and genomic features associated with outcomes. We estimated RFS and overall survival by using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to associate clinicogenomic features with survival outcomes.ResultsA search revealed 147 individuals with PDAC between January 2015 and January 2023. Median patient age was 67 years, with 57 (39%) patients older than 70 years. Unfavorable prognostic features included 52 (36%) patients with N2 nodal status, 115 (78%) patients with lymphovascular invasion, and 133 (90%) patients with perineural invasion. Median time from surgery to initiation of modified FOLFIRINOX was 1.78 months (IQR = 1.45-2.12). In total, 124 (84%) patients completed 12 doses; 98 (67%) patients stopped oxaliplatin early because of neuropathy (median = 10 doses, range = 4-12 doses). Further dosing characteristics are summarized in Table S3, with a median follow-up of 35.1 months, a median RFS of 26 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 19 to 39), and a median overall survival not reached. For the cohort older than 70 years of age, the median RFS was 23 months (95% CI = 14 to not reached) and the median overall survival was 51 months (95% CI = 37 to not reached). Modified FOLFIRINOX started sooner than 8 weeks from resection was associated with improved RFS (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.96; P = .033) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.3 to 0.94; P = .030). KRAS variation and whole-genome doubling trended to shorter RFS and overall survival. Homologous recombination deficiency status did not confer improved survival outcomes.ConclusionsAdjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX was effective and tolerated in patients with resected PDAC in a nontrial setting, including for patients older than 70 years of age.",0
"No studies have examined the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and HPV-18 on survival, inflammation biomarkers, and immune function in early-stage cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery. Patients diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer were screened for high-risk HPV prior to surgery. The influence of HPV infection on survival, inflammatory markers, and immune function was investigated. Findings revealed that patients in the HPV-18 positive subgroup exhibited poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and elevated levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, along with decreased CD4+ T cells compared to patients who tested negative for HPV-18. Notably, early-stage cervical cancer patients with HPV-18 infection experienced worse DFS, heightened inflammatory markers, and compromised immune function.","Aim: This cohort study evaluated the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and mortality as well as ICI discontinuation among older adults with NSCLC.Methods: 2007–2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database was used and survival analysis with time-varying exposure of irAEs was applied to estimate the associations.Results & conclusion: A total of 8,175 individuals were included, with 46.8% of whom developed an irAE. Cox regression models showed the occurrence of any irAEs was associated with increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.63–1.82) and treatment discontinuation (HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.78–1.97). Some variability was observed in the effect on the two outcomes depending on the type of irAE.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDChimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) represent an emerging immunotherapy for refractory multiple myeloma. While acute neurologic toxicities frequently occur and are well-described, hypokinetic movement disorders are rare and ill-defined. Clinical experience and therapeutic management therefore remain to be elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODSWe retrospectively searched the institutional databases from the Sections for Neuro-Oncology at the Yale School of Medicine (New Haven, Connecticut) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts) to identify patients that presented for evaluation of movement disorders following transfusion of BCMA-directed CAR T-cells. RESULTSWe identified four patients (females: n = 3, males: n = 1) with complex movement symptoms following transfusion of BCMA-targeting CAR T-cells. At presentation, median age was 74.5 ± 4.3 years (range, 67-77 years). All patients received a single transfusion of a commercially available CAR T-cell product (ciltacabtagene-autoleucel: n = 3; idecabtagene-vicleucel: n = 1). Parkinsonism-like symptoms were generally preceded by mild (maximal ICANS: grade 3) and transient (median duration: 4 days) neurotoxicity.Following resolution of acute neurotoxicity, all patients developed parkinsonism-like symptoms after a median of 23 ± 7 days (range, 19-35 days). Predominant motor symptoms were bradykinesia, oppositional paratonia, postural instability, and hypomimia. Psychiatric involvement was noted in three patients. Consistent with the potential on-target/off-tumor toxicity of the CAR T-cells against BCMA-positive basal ganglia, MRI revealed bilateral hyperintensities in the head of the caudate nucleus on FLAIR/T2-weighted or diffusion-weighted sequences in two patients. [18F]-FDG-PET scans revealed basal ganglia hypometabolism in one patient, diffuse frontal hypometabolism in another, and diffuse hypometabolism in a third patient.As symptoms progressed, treatment for movement symptoms was administered in all patients and included systemic immunosuppression (corticosteroids), interleukin-antagonists, aimed to reduce the number of circulating CAR T-cells (cyclophosphamide, intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine) or symptomatic treatment (levodopa/carbidopa). At a median follow-up of 115 days (range, 69-198 days), one patient died of sepsis despite aggressive therapy while symptoms stabilized in three patients. CONCLUSIONGiven that parkinsonism-like movement disorders may develop weeks after transfusion of BCMA-directed CAR T cells, a high degree of suspicion is crucial to establish diagnosis. Since symptom stabilization may be achieved, early diagnosis may form the basis for more favorable outcomes. Thus, a multidisciplinary care team appears crucial to provide optimal care of affected patients.","The continuous evolution of cancer therapy has driven the exploration of novel strategies to improve treatment specificity and efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. This article examines two innovative approaches that offer new directions in targeting cancer cells. The first approach focuses on developing antibodies that specifically bind to peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of immunotherapy. The second approach introduces quinazoline compounds that target and inhibit critical tyrosine kinases in cancer progression. Together, these advancements represent promising strides in the quest to develop more effective and precise cancer therapies, offering promising new avenues for treating resistant and aggressive forms of cancer.",0
"PurposeTo describe long-term prescribed drug use after rectal cancer treatment.MethodsWe identified 12,871 rectal cancer patients without distant metastasis between 2005 and 2016 and 64,341 matched population comparators using CRCBaSe (a Swedish nationwide register linkage of colorectal cancer patients). Mean defined daily doses (DDDs) of drug dispensing during relapse-free follow-up were calculated by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical drug categories. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from negative binomial regression were used to compare drug dispensing between patients and comparators.ResultsThe overall pattern of drug dispensing was similar among cancer survivors and comparators, although patients had higher mean DDDs of drugs regulating the digestive system. Excess dispensing of drugs for constipation (IRR, 3.35; 95% CI, 3.12–3.61), diarrhea (IRR, 6.43; 95% CI, 5.72–7.22), functional gastrointestinal disorders (IRR, 3.78; 95% CI, 3.15–4.54), and vitamin and mineral supplements (IRR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.24–1.50) was observed up to 10 years after surgery. Treatment with Hartmann’s procedure was associated with higher dispensing rates of digestive drugs compared to surgery with anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection but the association was attributed to higher use of diabetic drugs. Additionally, excess digestive drug dispensing was associated with more advanced cancer stage but not with (chemo)radiotherapy treatment.ConclusionsExcess drug use after rectal cancer is primarily driven by bowel-regulating drugs and is not modified by surgical or oncological treatment.Implications for Cancer SurvivorsThe excess use of bowel-regulating drugs after rectal cancer indicated long-standing postsurgical gastrointestinal morbidity and need of prophylaxis. Reassuringly, no excess use of other drug classes was noted long term.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11764-024-01548-9.","Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in key T cell genes can drive clinical pathologies and could be repurposed to improve cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we perform massively parallel base-editing screens to generate thousands of variants at gene loci annotated with known or potential clinical relevance. We discover a broad landscape of putative gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, including in PIK3CD and the gene encoding its regulatory subunit, PIK3R1, LCK, SOS1, AKT1 and RHOA. Base editing of PIK3CD and PIK3R1 variants in T cells with an engineered T cell receptor specific to a melanoma epitope or in different generations of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells demonstrates that discovered GOF variants, but not LOF or silent mutation controls, enhanced signaling, cytokine production and lysis of cognate melanoma and leukemia cell models, respectively. Additionally, we show that generations of CD19 CAR T cells engineered with PIK3CD GOF mutations demonstrate enhanced antigen-specific signaling, cytokine production and leukemia cell killing, including when benchmarked against other recent strategies.",0
"PurposeNew RT techniques and data emerging from follow-up for several tumor sites suggest that treatment volume de-escalation may permit to minimize therapy-related side effects and/or obtain better clinical outcomes. Here, we summarize the main evidence about volume de-escalation in RT.MethodThe relevant literature from PubMed was reviewed in this article. The ClinicalTrials.gov database was searched for clinical trials related to the specific topic.ResultsIn Lymphoma, large-volume techniques (extended- and involved-field RT) are being successfully replaced by involved-site RT and involved-node RT. In head and neck carcinoma, spare a part of elective neck is controversial. In early breast cancer, partial breast irradiation has been established as a treatment option in low-risk patients. In pancreatic cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy may be used to dose escalation. Stereotactic radiosurgery should be the treatment choice for patients with oligometastatic brain disease and a life expectancy of more than 3 months, and it should be considered an alternative to WBRT for patients with multiple brain metastases.ConclusionFurther clinical trials are necessary to improve the identification of suitable patient cohorts and the extent of possible volume de-escalation that does not compromise tumor control.","BackgroundDisulfidptosis, a recently discovered cellular death mechanism, has not been extensively studied in relation to breast cancer (BC). Specifically, no previous research has integrated disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs), cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs), and ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) to construct a prognostic signature for BC.MethodsDRGs, CRGs and FRGs with prognostic potential were identified through Cox regression analysis. A predictive model was constructed by intersecting the core genes obtained from unsupervised cluster analysis and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Differences in chemotherapy drug sensitivity, immune checkpoint levels were analyzed according to different risk score groups. The expression of the core disulfidptosis gene, SLC7A11, was analyzed using immunofluorescence.ResultsSingle-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed differential expression of DRGs in the BC tumor microenvironment. We developed a prognostic model, consisting of six genes, based on machine learning which included unsupervised cluster analysis and Lasso-Cox analysis. An internal training set and a validation set, both derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Breast Cancer (TCGA-BRCA) database, GSE20685 and GSE42568 as external validation sets all verified the model's validity. The low-risk group exhibited increased sensitivity to paclitaxel. Additionally, the high-risk group demonstrated significantly higher expression of tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability compared to the low-risk group. A nomogram confirmed that the risk score can be an independent risk factor for BC. Notably, our findings highlighted the impact of SLC7A11 on the BC tumor microenvironment. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed significantly higher expression of SLC7A11 in BC tissues compared to paracancerous tissues.ConclusionMultiplex analysis based on DRGs, CRGs and FRGs correlated strongly with BC, providing new insights for developing clinical prognostic tools and designing immunotherapy regimens for BC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05378-7.",1
"PurposeThe CCR5/CCL5 axis is essential for interactions between malignant cells and microenvironment components, promoting tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aims to evaluate the association of CCL5 and CCR5 with the behavior of oral cancer and assess the therapeutic potential of a CCR5 antagonist.MethodsA retrospective study to analyze CCR5 and CCL5 expression on paraffin-embedded tissues was performed. In cell lines, rhCCL5 was added to induce CCR5-related pathways, and Maraviroc and shRNA against CCR5 were used to neutralize the receptor. Finally, an in vivo murine orthotopic xenograft model of tongue cancer was used to evaluate Maraviroc as an oncologic therapy. After 15 days, the mice were killed, and the primary tumors and cervical lymph nodes were analyzed.ResultsThe expression of CCR5 was associated with clinical stage and metastasis, and CCL5 was related to overall survival. Adding rhCCL5 induced cell proliferation, while shRNA and Maraviroc reduced it in a dose-dependent manner. Maraviroc treatment also increased apoptosis and modified cytoskeletal organization. In vivo, Maraviroc reduced neck metastasis.ConclusionsThe effects of CCR5 antagonists in OSCC have been poorly studied, and this study reports in vitro and in vivo evidence for the effects of Maraviroc in OSCC. Our results suggest that the CCR5/CCL5 axis plays a role in oral cancer behavior, and that its inhibition is a promising new therapy alternative.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05443-1.","The myeloperoxidase (MPO) system of myeloid-derived cells (MDCs) is central to cellular innate immunity. Upon MDC activation, MPO is secreted into phagosomes where it catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent chlorinating oxidant. Here, we demonstrated that the myeloid lineage–restricted MPO-HOCl system had antitumor effects in early melanoma growth in aged mice. Orthotopic melanomas grew more slowly in immunocompetent MPO+/+ host mice compared to age-matched syngeneic MPO−/− mice. Real-time intravital tumor imaging in vivo and in cell cocultures revealed a cell-cell proximity-dependent association between MDC-derived MPO enzyme activity and blockade of ligand-induced IκBα degradation in tumor cells. HOCl directly trans-inhibited IκB kinase (IKK) activity in tumor cells, thereby decreasing nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activation and inducing changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways, cell cycle progression, and DNA replication. By contrast, HOCl induced transcriptional changes in CD8+ T cells related to ion transport and the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways that are associated with T cell activation. MPO increased the circulating concentrations of the myeloid cell–attracting cytokines CXCL1 and CXCL5, enhanced local infiltration by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and decreased tumor growth. Overall, these data reveal a role for MDC-derived HOCl as a small-molecule paracrine signaling factor that trans-inhibits IKK in melanoma tumor cells, mediating antitumor responses during early tumor progression.",0
"AbstractBackgroundCD8+ T cells are critical for the oncogenesis and progression of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor microenvironment, receiving antigen signals from antigen-presenting cells and directly contributing to antitumor responses.SummaryCD8+ T cells mediate immunogenic cell death, facilitate immune signal transmission, and play a significant role in various treatments, including surgery, transarterial chemoembolization, and immunotherapy. Extensive research on the role of CD8+ T cells within the HCC microenvironment has shown considerable progress. Immunometabolic targets on CD8+ T cells have demonstrated potential in combination with immunotherapies for HCC; however, they have not yet reached the clinical trial stage.Key MessagesThis review provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on immune and immunometabolic targets of CD8+ T cells within the HCC microenvironment. By highlighting advances and potential mechanisms, this review aims to support the development of effective clinical strategies in this field.","SummaryLag3 is an inhibitory coreceptor expressed on activated T cells and has been proposed to regulate Treg cell function. However, its precise modality and mechanisms remain elusive. We generated Treg cell-specific Lag3 mutant mouse models and found that Lag3 was essential for Treg cell control of autoimmunity. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that Lag3 mutation altered genes associated with metabolic processes, especially Myc target genes. Myc expression in Lag3 mutant Treg cells was increased to the level seen in conventional Th1 type effector cells and directly correlated with their metabolic profiles and in vivo suppressive functions. The PI3K-Akt-Rictor pathway was activated in Lag3 mutant Treg cells, and inhibiting PI3K, Rictor, or Ldha, a key Myc target enzyme converting pyruvate to lactate, was sufficient to restore normal metabolism and suppressive function in Lag3 mutant Treg cells. These findings indicate that Lag3 supports Treg cell suppression partly by tuning Myc-dependent metabolic programming.",1
"AbstractBackgroundCo-amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGFRvIII, a tumor-specific truncation mutant of EGFR, represent hallmark genetic lesions in glioblastoma.MethodsWe used phospho-proteomics, RNA-sequencing, TCGA data, glioblastoma cell culture, and mouse models to study the signal transduction mediated by EGFR and EGFRvIII.ResultsWe report that EGFR and EGFRvIII stimulate the innate immune defense receptor Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2); and that knockout of TLR2 dramatically improved survival in orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts. EGFR and EGFRvIII activated TLR2 in a ligand-independent manner, promoting tumor growth and immune evasion. We show that EGFR and EGFRvIII cooperate to activate the Rho-associated protein kinase ROCK2, which modulated malignant progression both by activating TLR2 and WNT signaling, and through remodeling the tumor microenvironment.ConclusionsTogether, our findings show that EGFR and EGFRvIII cooperate to drive tumor progression through ROCK2 and downstream WNT-β-catenin/TLR2 signaling pathways.","Cervical cancer elimination is a global health priority with the ambitious 90:70:90 target set by the WHO. This initiative aims for 90% of girls to be vaccinated against HPV, 70% of women to be screened with a high-performance test, and 90% of those who test positive to receive appropriate treatment by 2030. This editorial reflects on the journey from the initial declaration in 2018 to the present, highlighting the progress, challenges, and future directions in the fight against cervical cancer. With significant contributions from organizations like FIGO and FOGSI, the introduction of cost-effective vaccines and advanced screening methods, we are on a path towards achieving our targets. However, persistent efforts and global collaboration are essential to overcome the remaining hurdles.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy may give rise to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), or gas within the bowel wall, has very rarely been observed following ICI therapy, and its clinical significance is unclear. We described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of PI as a possible irAE in cancer patients.MethodsWe retrospectively identified 12 adult cancer patients with radiologic evidence of PI within 1 year after ICI exposure during January 2010–January 2023. Clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were evaluated.ResultsThe median age of our sample was 64 years. The most common cancer types were thoracic/head & neck and gastrointestinal. Eleven patients (92%) received anti-PD-1/L1 monotherapy, while 1 patient (8%) received a combination of anti-PD-1/L1 and anti-CTLA-4. PI occurred a median of 7 months after the first ICI dose. Half the patients (50%) were asymptomatic on diagnosis, and the most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (42%). Six patients experienced complications, namely pneumoperitoneum (n = 6, 50%) and microperforation (n = 1, 8%), identified on imaging. Nine patients were treated with antibiotics and 3 patients were monitored conservatively. Nine patients (75%) resumed cancer treatment after PI.ConclusionPI may develop as an irAE. While half of cases were incidental radiologic findings, management with antibiotics as well as hospitalization for observation may still be appropriate. The decision to restart cancer therapy and possibly resume ICI therapy remains to be elucidated. Further large-scale studies may be warranted to clarify the association between PI and ICI therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05461-z.","BackgroundNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a crucial treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC. However, only a subset of patients experience clinical benefit from ICIs. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that can predict response to ICIs is imperative for optimising patient selection.MethodsHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images of NSCLC patients were obtained from the local cohort (n = 106) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 899). We developed an ICI-related pathological prognostic signature (ir-PPS) based on H&E stained histopathology images to predict prognosis in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs using deep learning. To accomplish this, we employed a modified ResNet model (ResNet18-PG), a widely-used deep learning architecture well-known for its effectiveness in handling complex image recognition tasks. Our modifications include a progressive growing strategy to improve the stability of model training and the use of the AdamW optimiser, which enhances the optimisation process by adjusting the learning rate based on training dynamics.ResultsThe deep learning model, ResNet18-PG, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.918 and a recall of 0.995 on the local cohort. The ir-PPS effectively risk-stratified NSCLC patients. Patients in the low-risk group (n = 40) had significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) after ICI treatment compared to those in the high-risk group (n = 66, log-rank P = 0.004, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.65, 95%CI: 1.75–7.60). The ir-PPS demonstrated good discriminatory power for predicting 6-month PFS (AUC = 0.750), 12-month PFS (AUC = 0.677), and 18-month PFS (AUC = 0.662). The low-risk group exhibited increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules, cytotoxicity-related genes, an elevated abundance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, and enhanced activity in immune stimulatory pathways.ConclusionsThe ir-PPS signature derived from H&E images using deep learning could predict ICIs prognosis in NSCLC patients. The ir-PPS provides a novel imaging biomarker that may help select optimal candidates for ICIs therapy in NSCLC.",0
"ABSTRACTLoss of ovarian homeostasis is associated with ovary dysfunction and female diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the establishment of homeostasis and its function in the ovary have not been fully elucidated. Here, we showed that conditional knockout of Rab37 in oocytes impaired macroautophagy/autophagy proficiency in the ovary and interfered with follicular homeostasis and ovary development in mice. Flunarizine treatment upregulated autophagy, thus rescuing the impairment of follicular homeostasis and ovarian dysfunction in rab37 knockout mice by reprogramming of homeostasis. Notably, both the E2F1 and EGR2 transcription factors synergistically activated Rab37 transcription and promoted autophagy. Thus, RAB37-mediated autophagy ensures ovary function by maintaining ovarian homeostasis.Abbreviations: AMH: anti-Mullerian hormone; ATG: autophagy related; BECN1: beclin 1; cKO: conditional knockout; Cre: cyclization recombination enzyme; dpp: days postpartum; E2: estradiol; E2F1: E2F transcription factor 1; EBF1: EBF transcription factor 1; EGR2: early growth response 2; FSH: follicle stimulating hormone; LH: luteinizing hormone; mpp: months postpartum; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; RAB37: RAB37, member RAS oncogene family; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; Zp3: zona pellucida glycoprotein 3.","Cadmium is a well-known toxic heavy metal that poses significant health risks, particularly through inhalation, smoking, and the consumption of contaminated food. Exposure to cadmium is linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the systemic effects of intratracheal cadmium chloride (0.5 mg/kg) instillation in C57BL/6 mice. All parameters, including inflammation assessment, lung function evaluation (using Flexi-vent), and immunophenotyping of T-cells in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes), were analyzed 14 days after Cd exposure. The results demonstrated that cadmium exposure led to significant immune cell infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, altered pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and was associated with impaired lung function, characterized by increased lung resistance and Newtonian resistance. Analysis of T-cell populations revealed no significant changes in total T-cells in mediastinal lymph nodes and spleen, but a decrease in CD4+ T-cells and an increase in CD8+ T-cells were observed. These findings suggest that cadmium disrupts T-cell homeostasis in secondary lymphoid organs. Further research is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced lung injury and immune dysregulation, essential for developing effective therapeutic interventions against chronic lung diseases caused by cadmium exposure.",1
"Cytokeratin-positive interstitial reticulum cell (CIRC) tumor is an extremely rare malignant neoplasm and a subtype of fibroblastic reticular cell tumor, classified within the dendritic cell tumor group. We describe a case of an epicardial CIRC tumor that was resected and subsequently recurred in the left pulmonary hilum. This recurrence was treated with immunotherapy followed by radiotherapy. A 71-year-old man with a history of colon cancer incidentally had a mass bordering the epicardium on a postoperative follow-up computed tomography scan. Pericardial tumor resection was performed due to suspected metastasis from colon cancer. Histopathologically, the patient was diagnosed as a CIRC tumor (programmed death ligand 1 expression rate > 95%). Seven months after pericardial surgery, the patient was treated with nivolumab because of local recurrence in the left pulmonary hilum, but the tumor size gradually increased. Three months after the initiation of nivolumab, the patient had a completely atelectatic left lung due to tumor invasion into the left main bronchus and was treated with external beam radiotherapy of 66 Gy in 33 fractions. One and a half months after the completion of radiotherapy, the atelectasis disappeared, and aeration was greatly improved. Three months after the completion of radiotherapy, atelectasis and pericardial effusion appeared owing to tumor regrowth, and the patient died of heart failure 2 months later. This report provides insights into the efficacy of immunotherapy and radiotherapy for CIRC tumor.","Strategies integrating activation of innate and adaptive immunity against cancer are desired. We established a novel platform, Wilms’ tumor antigen 1 (WT1)-expressing artificial adjuvant vector cells (aAVC-WT1), linking invariant natural killer T (iNKT)-mediated dendritic cell activation to T cell immunity. Here, we report the first-in-human application of aAVC-WT1 in nine patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, whereas activation of iNKT and/or NK cells was observed in all patients. Five patients experienced objective leukemic regression, which correlated with WT1-specific T cell responses. Paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing demonstrated effector CD8+ T cell clones in the bone marrow. Some bone marrow CD8+ T cells underwent transition from pre-existing precursor exhausted T cells to functional T cells or emerged as newly activated T cells, some of which were maintained long term. These demonstrate the feasibility and safety of aAVC-WT1 therapy and the capacity of this platform to activate both innate and adaptive immunity in humans.",1
"Factor analysis provides a canonical framework for imposing lower-dimensional structure such as sparse covariance in high-dimensional data. High-dimensional data on the same set of variables are often collected under different conditions, for instance in reproducing studies across research groups. In such cases, it is natural to seek to learn the shared versus condition-specific structure. Existing hierarchical extensions of factor analysis have been proposed, but face practical issues including identifiability problems. To address these shortcomings, we propose a class of SUbspace Factor Analysis (SUFA) models, which characterize variation across groups at the level of a lower-dimensional subspace. We prove that the proposed class of SUFA models lead to identifiability of the shared versus group-specific components of the covariance, and study their posterior contraction properties. Taking a Bayesian approach, these contributions are developed alongside efficient posterior computation algorithms. Our sampler fully integrates out latent variables, is easily parallelizable and has complexity that does not depend on sample size. We illustrate the methods through application to integration of multiple gene expression datasets relevant to immunology.","BackgroundOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been recognized as a frequently occurring oral malignant tumor. Pyroptosis plays an extremely important role in the occurrence and development of cancer, but the role of pyroptosis in OSCC remains unclear.MethodsOSCC-related data were obtained from the TCGA and GEO databases. A PSscore risk model was constructed through LASSO regression analysis. The GEO database was utilized as the validation set of the model. The “ESTIMATE” and “CIBERSORT” algorithms were utilized to additionally evaluate the relationship between the immune cell score and PSscore. TIDE and IPS algorithms were used to assess patient response to immunotherapy. In addition, Western blot analysis and MTT assay was used to further validate key genes.ResultsComprehensive bioinformatics analysis showed that a low-PSscore had a significant survival advantage, richer immune cell infiltration, more active immune-related pathways, higher TME scores, and lower tumor purity. The results of TIDE and IPS analysis indicated that the high-PSscore group had higher immune escape potential and was less sensitive to immunotherapy. In contrast, the low-PSscore group patients might be more sensitive to PD1 and CTLA4 + PD1 immunotherapy. Univariate and multivariate COX results indicated that PSscore was an independent prognostic factor in OSCC patients. Another important finding is that BAK1 is a potential target of OSCC and is related to the Nod-like receptor signaling pathway. Knockdown of BAK1 can significantly reduce the proliferation of OSCC cells.ConclusionThe PSscore model could be utilized as a powerful prognostic indicator and can help in the development of new immunotherapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05074-6.",0
"SummaryIn 2010, modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria were proposed as a way of adapting the RECIST criteria to the particularities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We intended to overcome some limitations of RECIST in measuring tumour shrinkage with local and systemic therapies, and also to refine the assessment of progression that could be misinterpreted with conventional RECIST 1.1, due to clinical events related to the natural progression of chronic liver disease (development of ascites, enlargement of lymph nodes, etc.). mRECIST has served its purpose since being adopted or included in clinical practice guidelines (European, American and Asian) for the management of HCC; it has also been instrumental for assessing response and time-to-event endpoints in several phase II and III investigations. Nowadays, mRECIST has become the standard tool for measurement of radiological endpoints at early/intermediate stages of HCC. At advanced stages, guidelines recommend both methods. mRECIST has been proven to capture higher objective response rates in tumours treated with molecular therapies and those responses have shown to be independently associated with better survival. With the advent of novel treatment approaches (that is immunotherapy) and combination therapies there is a need to further refine and clarify some concepts around the performance of mRECIST. Similarly, changes in the landscape of standard of care at advanced stages of the disease are pointing towards progression-free survival as a potential primary endpoint in some phase III investigations, as effective therapies applied beyond progression might mask overall survival results. Strict recommendations for adopting this endpoint have been reported. Overall, we review the performance of mRECIST during the last decade, incorporating novel clarifications and refinements in light of emerging challenges in the study and management of HCC.","BACKGROUND & AIMS:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a rapidly changing landscape of treatments. In the past 20 years, numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have aimed at improving outcomes across disease stages. We aimed to analyze the current evidence and identify potential factors influencing response to therapies.METHODS:We conducted a systematic review of phase III RCTs (2002–2020) across disease stages. A meta-analysis was designed to examine the relationship between etiology and outcome after systemic therapies with either tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)/antiangiogenic or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.RESULTS:Out of 10,100 studies identified, 76 were phase III RCTs. Among them, a rigorous screening algorithm identified 49 with high quality including a total of 22,113 patients undergoing adjuvant (n = 7) and primary treatment for early (n = 2), intermediate (n = 7), and advanced (first-line, n = 21; second-line, n = 12) stages of disease. Nine of these trials were positive, 6 treatments have been adopted in guidelines (sorafenib [2 RCTs], lenvatinib, atezolizumab+bevacizumab, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab), but 2 were not (adjuvant CIK cells and sorafenib plus hepatic arterial infusion with FOLFOX). Meta-analysis of 8 trials including 3739 patients revealed ICI therapy to be significantly more effective in patients with viral hepatitis compared with nonviral-related HCC, whereas no differences related to etiology were observed in patients treated with TKI/anti–vascular endothelial growth factor.CONCLUSIONS:Among 49 high-quality RCTs conducted in HCC during 2002–2020, 9 resulted in positive results. A meta-analysis of systemic therapies suggests that immunotherapies may be more effective in viral etiologies.",1
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Pathologically, this disease is associated with the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuroinflammation. Current drug treatments primarily focus on managing symptoms rather than stopping disease progression. Disease-modifying therapies target the clearance of amyloid plaques through active and passive immunity methods. Although successful in animal models, human trials have shown adverse effects, such as meningoencephalitis, in a small number of patients who received active immunity methods. The efficacy of active immunity methods in treating AD remains uncertain, but passive immunity methods amyloid-beta (Abeta)-specific monoclonal antibody therapies such as aducanumab and lecanemab have been approved by the FDA. Despite the limitations of immune-based therapies, T-cell, and chimeric antigen receptor-based treatments show promise, but new guidelines are necessary to address potential adverse events. Research into the relationship between adaptive immune responses and AD is expected to provide innovative treatment approaches.","AbstractThe emergence of organoids is considered a revolutionary model, changing the landscape of traditional translational research. These three-dimensional miniatures of human organs or tissues, cultivated from stem cells or biospecimens obtained from patients, faithfully replicate the structural and functional characteristics of specific target organs or tissues. In this extensive review, we explore the profound impact of organoids and assess the current state of living organoid biobanks, which are essential repositories for cryopreserving organoids derived from a variety of diseases. These resources hold significant value for translational research. We delve into the diverse origins of organoids, the underlying technologies, and their roles in recapitulating human development, disease modeling, as well as their potential applications in the pharmaceutical field. With a particular emphasis on biobanking organoids for prospective applications, we discuss how these advancements expedite the transition from bench to bedside translational research, thereby fostering personalized medicine and enriching our comprehension of human health.",0

"Background:Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive inflammatory liver disease characterized by biliary and liver fibrosis. Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is important in the inflammatory process driving liver fibrosis. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of VAP-1 blockade with a monoclonal antibody (timolumab, BTT1023) in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.Methods:BUTEO was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II trial, conducted in 6 centers in the United Kingdom. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis aged 18–75 years had an alkaline phosphatase value of >1.5 times the upper limit of normal. The dose-confirmatory stage aimed to confirm the safety of timolumab through the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity and sufficient trough levels of circulating antibody to block VAP-1 function. The primary outcome of the dose-expansion portion of the trial was patient’s response to timolumab at day 99, as measured by a reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase by 25% or more from baseline to day 99.Results:Twenty-three patients were recruited: 7 into the initial dose-confirmatory stage and a further 16 into an expansion stage. Timolumab (8 mg/kg) was confirmed to be safe for the duration of administration with sufficient circulating levels. Only 2 of the 18 evaluable patients (11.1%) achieved a reduction in alkaline phosphatase levels of 25% or more, and both the proportion of circulating inflammatory cell populations and biomarkers of fibrosis remained unchanged from baseline.Conclusions:The BUTEO trial confirmed 8 mg/kg timolumab had no short-term safety signals and resulted in sufficient circulating levels of VAP-1 blocking timolumab. However, the trial was stopped after an interim assessment due to a lack of efficacy as determined by no significant change in serum liver tests.","PurposeTo demonstrate the biological function of Secreted Phosphoprotein 1(SPP1) and its immune suppressive role in the progression intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).MethodsWe collected 62,770 cells’ published transcriptome data of nine patients whose paired adjacent liver and tumor tissues were both available. We applied differential gene expression analysis to screen potential ICC marker genes, survival analysis to verify the prognostic value of SPP1, and correlation analysis to decipher factors that are related to SPP1 expression. The CellChat was used to distinguish interactions between cancer and T cells. CytoSig was applied to query cytokines that modulate CD44. Further, we established a proliferation score and correlated the score with inhibitory signals to determine the proliferation-suppressive function of SPP1-CD44.ResultsSPP1 expression is significantly upregulated in tumoral epitheliums, and patients with higher SPP1 expression have worse survival (P < 0.05). Tumor cells communicate with T cells via SPP1-CD44 interactions. The average expression of SPP1 in malignant cells (SPP1m) and CD44 in T cells (CD44t) is moderately negatively correlated with T cell proliferation score. Immunosuppressive cytokine TGFβ-3 identified as an inducer of CD44 and was significantly negatively correlated with proliferation score (R = − 0.88, P < 0.01), and the negative correlation was aggravated in samples with high CD44 expression.ConclusionSPP1 is a prognostic marker of ICC and is associated with the genome heterogeneity. SPP1-CD44 hinders sustained proliferation of T cells, but immunosuppressive T cells in the tumor microenvironment may evade this inhibition by reducing CD44 expression.

"Current seasonal influenza virus vaccines induce responses primarily against immunodominant but highly plastic epitopes in globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. Due to viral antigenic drift at these sites, vaccines need to be updated and re-administered annually. To increase the breadth of influenza vaccine-mediated protection, we developed an antigenically complex mixture of recombinant HAs designed to redirect immune responses to more conserved domains of the protein. Indeed, vaccine-induced antibodies were disproportionally redistributed to the more conserved stalk of the HA without hindering, and in some cases improving, antibody responses against the head domain. These improved responses led to increased protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenge in both mice and ferrets compared with conventional vaccine approaches. Thus, antigenically complex protein mixtures can at least partially overcome HA head domain antigenic immunodominance and may represent a step towards a more universal influenza vaccine.","ABSTRACTPeople living with cancer have a profound need to understand any potential negative impacts of treatment on their everyday lives and whether the treatment itself could cause other long-term health challenges.

"AbstractThe interaction between Tim‐3 on T cell and its ligand, Galectin‐9, negatively regulates cellular immune responses. However, the role of Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 pathway in the immune evasion of cervical cancer remains unknown. This study is to investigate the expression, function, and regulation of Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 signaling pathway in human papilloma virus (HPV) positive cervical cancer. Flow cytometry showed that Tim‐3 expression on T cell and Galectin‐9 expression on monocytes in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly higher compared to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and benign uterine fibroids Tim‐3 + CD4+ Th1 cells and Tim‐3 + CD8+ T cells in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly reduced after surgery. Serum TGF‐β and IL‐10 levels were positively correlated with Tim‐3 + Treg cells, while IFN‐γ and IL‐2 were negatively correlated with Tim‐3 + Th1 cells. Additionally, Tim‐3 + CD4+ T cells were positively correlated with Galectin‐9 + monocytes. Survival curve analysis showed that Tim‐3 + CD4+ T cells were negatively correlated with patient survival, and closely related to FIGO stage, degree of differentiation, and lymph node metastasis of HPV positive cervical cancer. In vitro experiments showed that by blocking the Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 pathway, the proliferation of T cells and their ability to express IFN‐γ, IL‐2, perforin, and granzyme B was significantly restored. In conclusion, high levels of Tim‐3 and Galectin‐9 in HPV positive cervical cancer patients play roles in the progression of disease by promoting Treg cells to inhibit the cytotoxic function of Th1 and CD8+ T cells. Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 may serve as a new immunotherapy target for patients with HPV positive cervical cancer.","BackgroundCholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant epithelial tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis. Given the lack of therapeutic strategies and durable treatment options currently available, identifying innovative treatments for CCA is an urgent unmet clinical need. Cucurbitacin C (CuC) is a distinct variant of the cucurbitacin family, displaying promising anti-cancer activity against various tumor types. The primary objective of our research is to elucidate the promising effects of CuC on CCA.MethodsThe impact of CuC on CCA cell lines was assessed by cell count kit-8 assay, EdU staining assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing assay, and Transwell assay. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted to explore the function of CuC treatments on cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis in CCA cells. Computational biology and network pharmacology approaches were utilized to predict potential targets of CuC. Furthermore, a tumor xenograft mouse model was established using CCA cells to explore the anti-cancer effects of CuC in vivo.ResultsOur research findings revealed that CuC exerted a suppressive effect on CCA cell progression. Cell viability assays, EdU staining assays, and colony formation assays demonstrated that CuC effectively suppressed viability and proliferation of CCA cells. Wound-healing assays and Transwell assays indicated that CuC effectively inhibits the migratory and invasive capabilities of CCA cells. Flow cytometry analysis elucidated that CuC played its anti-proliferative role in CCA cells by arresting G0/G1 phase and increasing apoptosis. Through bioinformatics and network pharmacology analysis, in conjunction with western blot analysis, we demonstrated CuC mediated the inhibition of CCA cell progression through modulation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Additionally, the CCA xenograft tumor model was established, and the results supported the inhibition of CuC treatment against CCA progression in vivo.ConclusionOur study demonstrates that CuC possesses notable capabilities to suppress cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CCA. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of CuC on CCA progression are attributed to its modulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Altogether, our study demonstrated that CuC holds promise as a prospective therapeutic agent for treating CCA.",0
"ABSTRACTFor the past few years, researchers and oncologists have been pushing to find biomarkers that would help predict which treatment option would best work on a patient. Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is one of the latest biomarkers that is being studied and considered as a promising agnostic immunotherapy biomarker. However, it still shows controversial results in studies due to the difficulty in finding solid comparable results. This is a consequence of different cutoff definitions among many cancer types, age ranges, and the use of different sequencing assays, in addition to its association with other biomarkers such as PD-L1. Finally, the use of composite biomarkers to assess the genetic signature of a tumor might be the way forward to seriously use TMB as an agnostic biomarker.","A rich pipeline of therapeutic candidates is advancing for Parkinson’s disease, many of which are targeting the underlying pathophysiology of disease. Emerging evidence grounded in novel genetics and biomarker discoveries is illuminating the true promise of precision medicine-based therapeutic strategies for PD. There has been a growing effort to investigate disease-modifying therapies by designing clinical trials for genetic forms of PD - providing a clearer link to underlying pathophysiology. Leading candidate genes based on human genetic findings that are under active investigation in an array of basic and translational models include SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA. Broad investigations across mechanistic models show that these genes signal through common molecular pathways, namely, autosomal lysosomal pathways, inflammation and mitochondrial function. Therapeutic clinical trials to date based on genetically defined targets have not yet achieved approvals; however, much is to be learned from such pioneering trials. Fundamental principles of drug development that include proof of pharmacology in target tissue are critical to have confidence in advancing such precision-based therapies. There is a clear need for downstream biomarkers of leading candidate therapies to demonstrate proof of mechanism. The current regulatory landscape is poised and primed to support translational modeling strategies for the effective advancement of PD disease-modifying therapeutic candidates. A convergence of rich complex data that is available, the regulatory framework of model informed drug development (MIDD), and the new biological integrated staging frameworks when combined are collectively setting the stage for advancing new approaches in PD to accelerate progress. This perspective review highlights the potential of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling in contributing to the field and hastening the pace of progress in advancing collaborative approaches for urgently needed PD disease-modifying treatments.",1
"PurposeTo compare the toxicity and clinical efficacy of TL (docetaxel + lobaplatin) induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy and TPF (docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Methods and patientsIn total, 128 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled between August 2016 and April 2021. They were randomly divided into trial group and control group, all using chronological dosage mode. The trial group used TL regimen induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy; the control group used TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The endpoints were adverse events and survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years.ResultsMedian follow-up was 42 months (20–71 months).  Adverse events: During induction chemotherapy, compared with TPF group, grade 3–4 leukocytes and neutrophils, diarrhea, 1–2 hyperbilirubinemia, nausea / vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, hyponatremia were significantly lower in TL group (p<0. 05): 6% vs. 35%, 14% vs. 53%, 0% vs. 6%, 15% vs. 40%, 9% vs. 56%, 0% vs. 10%, 3% vs. 13%, 2% vs. 23%, 15% vs. 74%. During chemoradiotherapy, the incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalaemia and grade 1–2 nausea was significantly lower in the TL group (p<0. 05), with 24% vs. 69%, 20% vs. 65% and 24% vs. 44%, respectively. However, more grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia were observed in the TL group (15% vs. 3%, p<0. 05).  There was no significant difference in the recent objective response rate (ORR) between patients with TL group and TPF group (p=0.961).  There was no statistical difference in 1, 3 and 5 years OS between TL group and TPF group, respectively, (71.0% vs. 67.5%, p=0.573), (56.6% vs. 56.9%, p=0.814), (52.5% vs. 52.9%, p=0.841); 1, 3 and 5 years PFS are: (63.4% vs. 64.0%, p=0.883), (51.1% vs. 54.0%, p=0.705) and (47.3% vs. 45.9%, p=0.887), None of them were significantly different. Multivariate analysis of COX regression showed that T stage (p=0.01) and surgery (p=0.046) were independent factors affecting PFS and OS, respectively. OS subgroup analysis shows that people receiving the TL regimen in postoperative and nodal stage N1 and N2 patients tended to survive longer than those receiving the TPF regimen.ConclusionPatients with postoperative, N1 or N2 stage locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may have more significant clinical benefits when treated with TL regimen. TL regimen has advantages in reducing toxic side effects and can be used as one of the first-line treatment options.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03117257).","Objective.Social determinants of health (SDOH) impact cancer outcomes. The CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) integrates scores for four neighborhood-based SDOH domains (socioeconomic status, household characteristics, minority status, and housing type/transportation) to assess neighborhood social vulnerability (NSV). While NSV has been associated with overall cancer mortality and lung, breast, colon, and endometrial cancer-specific mortality, the relationship between NSV as defined by the SVI and ovarian cancer outcomes remains unknown.Methods.We used data from 177 patients enrolled in an observational ovarian cancer cohort study from October 2012 through September 2022. All patients underwent debulking surgery and completed an entire course of standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy. Follow-up was completed through May 2024. SVI was calculated using census tract at diagnosis. High NSV was defined as SVI in the top quartile of the cohort. Cox proportional hazard models assessed the association between NSV and progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival.Results.After accounting for demographic and clinical factors, high NSV was associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:2.31 [95% CI:1.48–3.61]; P < 0.001) and OS (HR:1.79 [95% CI:1.10–2.92]; P = 0.02), with neighborhood socioeconomic status associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:2.29 [95% CI:1.47–3.56]; P < 0.001) and OS (HR:1.71 [95% CI:1.04–2.80]; P = 0.03). Neighborhood housing type/transportation was also associated with significantly worse PFS (HR:1.65 [95% CI:1.07–2.55]; P = 0.02) and trended towards worse OS (HR:1.43 [95% CI:0.80–2.33]).Conclusion and relevance.Higher neighborhood social vulnerability is associated with worse outcomes among ovarian cancer patients. Validating these results in a population-based cohort and assessing programs to reduce neighborhood social vulnerability to improve ovarian cancer outcomes is warranted.",0
"BackgroundGastric cancer (GC) remains a global challenge due to its high morbidity and mortality rates especially in Asia as well as poor response to treatment. As a member of the adhesion protein family and transmembrane glycoprotein, EpCAM expressed excessively in cancer cells including GC cells. The database assay showed that EpCAM is excessively expressed and easily mutated in cancers, especially in early stage of GC.MethodsTo explore the roles EpCAM plays in oncogenesis and progression of GC, the expression of EpCAM was deleted in GC cells with CRISPR/Cas9 method, and then the changes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility and motility associated microstructures in EpCAM-deleted GC cells (EpCAM-/-SGC7901) were detected to evaluate the rules EpCAM played.ResultsThe results showed that EpCAM deletion caused cell proliferation, motility and the development of motility-relevant microstructures inhibited significantly, apoptotic trend and contact inhibition enhanced in EpCAM-deleted GC cells. The results of western blot suggested that EpCAM modulates the expression of epithelial/endothelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) correlated genes. All results as above indicated that EpCAM plays important roles to enhance the oncogenesis, malignancy and progression as a GC enhancer.ConclusionsCombining our results and published data together, the interaction of EpCAM with other proteins was also discussed and concluded in the discussion. Our results support that EpCAM can be considered as a novel target for the diagnosis and therapy of GC in future.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04767-2.","ResumenIntroducción:en este trabajo se implementa un método probabilístico para estimar la esperanza de vida de hombres y mujeres por edad; el método de Double GAP o Doble Brecha. La aplicación al caso de Argentina intenta aportar información al fenómeno del envejecimiento poblacional y su relación con el sistema previsional.Objetivo:presentar estimaciones y proyecciones de la esperanza de vida de hombres y mujeres por edad obtenidas a través de un método probabilístico que contempla el dferencial por sexo, hasta el año 2025.Material y métodos:se estima el método de Double GAP o Doble Brecha, y luego se seleccionan las esperanzas de vida a los 60 y a los 65 años (para mujeres y varones respectivamente), dado que se trata de las edades jubilatorias de Argentina y se presentan los pronósticos y sus correspondientes intervalos de confianza.Resultados:los pronósticos del modelo Doble Brecha indican que las esperanzas de vida en Argentina tanto a los 60 como a los 65 años, crecerán levemente hasta 2025. Para las mujeres se incrementa medio año, mientras que en los varones el crecimiento de la esperanza es levemente superior. Esto último, muestra también una tendencia lenta hacia una convergencia entre las esperanzas de vida masculina y femenina.Conclusiones:se pone en evidencia cómo Argentina está lejos de registrar un récord de esperanza de vida a nivel mundial para estas edades, debido a que los pronósticos de esperanza de vida que genera el modelo de Doble Brecha para el país están muy lejos de la tendencia de las buenas prácticas (serie de máximos en la esperanza de vida).",0
"BackgroundNon-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) makes up about 85% of lung cancer cases, mainly adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Recently, PD-1 inhibitors have become crucial in NSCLC treatment, significantly enhancing survival for some. However, side effects, like skin reactions and hematotoxicity, limit their use, with drug-induced TEN and immunotherapy-induced agranulocytosis as severe adverse effects.Case PresentationHerein, we have reported the case of a 75-year-old male diagnosed with metastatic Lung Squamous cell Carcinoma (LUSC) in the left lung. He received first-line treatment with one cycle of tislelizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, after which he developed Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and granulocytopenia. To address these two serious immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs), the patient was administered methylprednisolone in combination with gamma globulin for TEN and dexamethasone in combination with G-CSF for agranulocytosis. Antibiotics were also administered according to the patient’s medication regimen. After treatment, the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital. It was also noted that the lung tumor condition improved.ConclusionEffective management of severe immune-related side effects from tislelizumab, including TEN and agranulocytosis, can be partly achieved through steroids, gamma globulin, G-CSF, and antibiotics. This strategy not only alleviates these adverse effects, but also potentially improves tumor conditions, highlighting the crucial role of vigilant monitoring and management in immunotherapy.","AbstractCancer is one of most lethal diseases worldwide. Chemotherapeutics and surgeries are among the treatment facilities available for curing cancer. However due to their negative impact on normal cells and drug resistance development, new treatment strategies have yet to be developed. Some microbial products exhibit therapeutic potential for treating cancer. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Azurins have shown anticancer effects against breast cancer without affecting normal cells. To enhance its cytotoxic effect and targeted delivery, we fused Azurin with a cell-penetrating peptide (BR2) through a rigid linker and evaluated its anticancer potential via in silico analysis. The prediction of the secondary and the tertiary structures and analysis of physiochemical properties of chimeric proteins were computationally performed. The Azurin-BR2 chimeric protein has a basic nature with a molecular weight of 16.8 kDa. The quality indices and validation of chimeric proteins were performed with ERRAT2 and Ramachandran plot values, respectively. The quality index of the chimeric protein was predicted to be 81% to 84.6%, and residues residing in the most favoured region were identified. The HDOCK bioinformatics tool was used for docking a chimeric protein with a cancer suppressor protein p53. The results of the current study support that an Azurin-BR2 fusion protein has a high binding affinity for p53 can induce apoptosis in cancerous cells, and can be used in tumor-targeting therapy.",0
"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic age-related chronic lung disease characterized by the accumulation of senescent cells. Whether impaired immune response is responsible for the accumulation of senescent cells in the IPF lung remains unknown. Here we characterized the NK phenotype in IPF lungs via flow cytometry using C12FDG, markers of tissue residence, and chemokine receptors. The effect of the lung microenvironment was evaluated using lung fibroblast (LF) conditioned media and the bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was used to assess the in vivo relationship between NK cells and the accumulation of senescent cells. We found that NK cells from the lower lobe of IPF patients (IPF-LL) exhibited immune-senescent and impaired CD57-NKG2A+ phenotype. We also observed that culture of NK cells from healthy donors in conditioned media (CM) from IPF-LL-LF induced a senescent like phenotype and impaired cytotoxic capacity. There is an impaired NK recruitment by LF and NKs presented decreased migration toward their CM. Additionally, NK cell-depleted mice treated with bleomycin showed increased collagen deposition, and accumulation of different populations of senescent cells compared to controls. The IPF lung microenvironment induces a dysfunctional NK phenotype limiting the clearance of lung senescent cells and the resolution of lung fibrosis. We propose that impaired NK activity could be one of the mechanisms responsible for perpetuating the accumulation of senescent cells in IPF lungs.","ABSTRACTTelomeres, crucial for chromosomal integrity, have been related to aging and cancer formation, mainly through regulating G-quadruplex structures. G-quadruplexes are structural motifs that can arise as secondary structures of nucleic acids, especially in guanine-rich DNA and RNA regions. Targeting these structures by small compounds shows promise in the selective suppression of cell growth, opening up novel possibilities for anticancer treatment. A comprehensive investigation of the many structural forms of G-quadruplex ligands is required to create ground-breaking anticancer drugs. Recent research into using specific benzimidazole molecules in stabilizing telomeric DNA into G-quadruplex structures has highlighted their ability to influence oncogene expression and demonstrate antiproliferative characteristics against cancer cells. This review describes the benzimidazole derivative, designed to enhance the stability of the G-quadruplex structure DNA to suppress the activity of telomerase enzyme, exhibiting promising potential for anticancer therapy",0
"BackgroundExosomes are extracellular nanometric vesicles used by cells to communicate with each other. They are responsible for many pathological conditions, including tumors by transferring regulatory biomolecules that impact target cell activity. Because of their high concentration in exosomes compared with parental cells and the rest of exosomal content, specificity to the cell of origin, and their well-organized sorting mechanism, microRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to be the most potent exosomes cargo and used by scientists to track exosomes and to detect cell activity changes and prognosis in cancer early.PurposeIn this review, the results of studies examining the role of exosomes in cancer pathophysiology and their clinical potential are discussed in detail.Summary of the FindingsTumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) mediate the dynamic changes of cancer growth and invasion, including local microenvironment remodeling, distance metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor-associated immunosuppression. They also contribute to hypoxia-induced tumor progression and cancer cell drug resistance. As a result of exosomes being present in all body fluids, it is possible to have early accessible and less-invasive diagnostic and prognostic measures by forming a table for each cancer type and its matched specific miRNAs. Under testing, available therapeutic uses of exosomes include interference of exosomes biogenesis, secretion, or uptake, and recruitment of exosomes as target-specific drug delivery vehicles, and immunostimulatory agents for both cancer patients and healthy population to avoid cancer development from the start.ConclusionThese data suggest that exosomes and exosomal microRNA are directly related to cancer progression mechanisms, and could be used in cancer early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.","AbstractCancer is one of most lethal diseases worldwide.

"TCF1high progenitor CD8+ T cells mediate the efficacy of immunotherapy, however the mechanisms that govern their generation and maintenance are poorly understood. Here, we show that targeting glycolysis through deletion of pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2) results in elevated pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity, leading to enrichment of a TCF1high progenitor exhausted-like phenotype and increased responsiveness to PD-1 blockade in vivo. PKM2KO CD8+ T cells showed reduced glycolytic flux, accumulation of glycolytic intermediates and PPP metabolites, and increased PPP cycling as determined by 1,2 13C glucose carbon tracing. Small molecule agonism of the PPP without acute glycolytic impairment skewed CD8+ T cells towards a TCF1high population, generated a unique transcriptional landscape, and adoptive transfer of agonist-treated CD8+ T cells enhanced tumor control in mice in combination with PD-1 blockade, and promoted tumor killing in patient-derived tumor organoids. Our study demonstrates a new metabolic reprogramming that contributes to a progenitor-like T cell state promoting immunotherapy efficacy.","BackgroundLiver resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) while the postoperative prognosis varies greatly, with no recognized biomarker. We aimed to identify the plasma metabolomic biomarkers that could be used for preoperative risk stratification of ICC patients.Methods108 eligible ICC patients who underwent radical surgical resection between August 2012 and October 2020 were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into a discovery cohort (n = 76) and a validation cohort (n = 32) by 7:3. Metabolomics profiling of preoperative plasma was performed and clinical data were collected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, Cox regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to screen and validate the survival-related metabolic biomarker panel and construct a LASSO-Cox prediction model.Results10 survival-related metabolic biomarkers were used for construction of a LASSO-Cox prediction model. In the discovery and validation cohorts, the LASSO-Cox prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.876 (95%CI: 0.777–0.974) and 0.860 (95%CI: 0.711–1.000) in evaluating 1-year OS of ICC patients, respectively. The OS of ICC patients in the high-risk group was significantly worse than that in the low-risk group (discovery cohort, p < 0.0001; validation cohort: p = 0.041). Also, the LASSO-Cox risk score (HR 2.43, 95%CI: 1.81–3.26, p < 0.0001) was a significant independent risk factor associated with OS.ConclusionsThe LASSO-Cox prediction model has potential as an important tool in evaluating the OS of ICC patients after surgical resection and can be used as prediction tools to implement the best treatment options that could result in better outcomes.",0
"IntroductionCharacterized by vast heterogeneity, gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. A specific prognostic model is necessary for the improvement of clinical treatment strategies. Hypoxia is a common feature in the tumor microenvironment that promotes tumor progression. However, the current evaluation of the hypoxic tumor immune microenvironment in GC is still inadequate.Material and methodsWith sequence data and single nucleotide variants data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas-STAD dataset as well as hypoxia- and immune-related genes acquired from MsigDB and ImmPort, a hypoxia-immune-based gene signature of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) was built by Cox regression analysis. The risk score could be used as an independent prognostic factor.ResultsThe receiver operating characteristic curve and survival curve showed the accuracy of the model. Pearson correlation analysis showed that DUSP1, one of the hypoxia- and immune-related feature genes, was positively correlated with immune cell scores and immune-related function scores. In addition, low-risk group peers were found to be in higher immune infiltration status and had a higher immunophenoscore as demonstrated by single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), indicating a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment among the low-risk group. q-PCR results showed that DUSP1, IGFBP1, CGB5, GPC3 and EGF were significantly highly expressed in STAD cells, while FAM3D and FGF8 were significantly down-regulated.ConclusionsOverall, our study not only paves the way for future studies focusing on hypoxia and the immune microenvironment but also improves STAD patients’ prognosis and their response to immunotherapy.","ABSTRACTRegenerative therapy, a key area of tissue engineering, holds promise for restoring damaged organs, especially in bone regeneration. Bone healing is natural to the body but becomes complex under stress and disease. Large bone deformities pose significant challenges in tissue engineering. Among various methods, scaffolds are attractive as they provide structural support and essential nutrients for cell adhesion and growth. Collagen and hydroxyapatite (HA) are widely used due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Collagen and nano-scale HA enhance cell adhesion and development. Thus, nano HA/collagen scaffolds offer potential solutions for bone regeneration. This review focuses on the use and production of nano-sized HA/collagen composites in bone regeneration.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDRecent advances in neuro-oncology highlighted the meninges as an important immunological hub at the crossroads between systemic immunity and the central nervous system. Meningiomas are predominantly benign tumors arising from meningeal cells. However, about 20% are high-grade cases, commonly refractory to standard treatment, showing high recurrence rates. Methylation-based classification has crucially improved meningioma patient stratification. However, the biological processes that govern differences between these classes remain unknown. Here, we investigate the role of differential immune infiltration, cellular communities, and their spatial organization. In light of previously found differential immune infiltration across methylation classes, this study aims to spatially resolve the role of myeloid cells and study their influence on tumor progression and recurrence. MATERIAL AND METHODSWe deployed multiplexed ion beam imagining and spatial transcriptomics on a retrospective cohort with extensive clinical annotations. Analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data of a subset of patients (n=22), we delineated the expression of gene and protein markers that were used to design an antibody panel comprising 41 targets for cell-type identification, phenotypic and metabolic characterization at the protein level. Additionally, we curated a targeted gene panel for spatial transcriptomics to perform granular spatial analysis. An integration of histological, spatial transcriptomic, and protein layers provides a comprehensive multi-omics approach to studying spatial cellular interactions. RESULTSTranscriptional programs and cell populations observed in single-nuclei data were captured in the spatial context revealing differences in the myeloid compartment across meningioma methylation classes. In specific classes, myeloid cells constitute a significant part of the tumor bulk warranting further investigation into their phenotypic differences. Accordingly, our analyses revealed a distinct phenotypic macrophage landscape along disease progression. Furthermore, spatial profiling of the metabolic regulome displayed distinct niche formation within perivascular and tumor compartments. CONCLUSIONIn this study we confirm that macrophages undergo a phenotypic switch from more tolerogenic in low-grade to inflammatory in high-grade cases of meningioma. Correspondingly, specific phenotypic and metabolic features of myeloid and tumor cells contribute to tumor progressions. Considering the limited targeted therapy options and poor responses to immunotherapy in meningioma patients, we hope that our spatial multi-omics analysis may reveal recurrent infiltration patterns of phenotypically distinct cell types that could be informative of biological processes and predictive of disease outcome.","IntroductionGround glass opacity featured lung adenocarcinomas (GGO-LUAD) display more indolent biological behavior than solid nodule featured lung adenocarcinomas (SN-LUAD) and have an excellent prognosis. However, the cellular immune characteristics of GGO-LUAD remain poorly understood.MethodsImmunohistochemistry technique was performed to stain related immune markers (CD8, CD103, CD20, CD138, CD4, FOXP3, CD68, CD163, PD-1 and PD-L1) and TGF-β from 15 patients with pure GGO-LUAD and 15 patients with SN-LUAD tissue sections (Paired cohort), and then, the related markers with significant differences were verified on 10 patients (Verified cohort) with both pure GGO-LUAD and SN-LUAD. For localization analysis of CD68 + tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and FOXP3 + Terg cells in tumor areas, pure GGO-LUAD and SN-LUAD were also stained for simultaneous detection of pan-CK, CD68 and FOXP3 by multiplex immunofluorescence.ResultsIn the Paired cohort, compared with SN-LUAD, only the infiltration of TAMs and Treg cells was significantly lower in GGO-LUAD. The infiltration of the remaining immune cells including CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, CD103 + T cells, CD20 + B cells and CD138 + Plasma cells in GGO-LUAD, although relatively low, was not significantly different. Meanwhile, the expression of TGF-β was significantly higher in SN-LUAD. And the above results have also been confirmed in the Verified cohort. Moreover, there was no significantly difference in PD-L1 expression in GGO-LUAD compared to SN-LUAD both in the Paired cohort and Verified cohort.ConclusionsGGO-LUAD demonstrates an overall less active immune landscape as compared with SN-LUAD. TAMs and TGF-β may play an important role in the progression of GGO-LUAD. More importantly, PD-L1 expression in GGO-LUAD is comparable to that in SN-LUAD, indicating that there may be other reasons for the insensitivity of GGO-LUAD to immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04289-3.",0
"Dendritic cells (DCs) are uniquely capable of transporting tumoral antigens to tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs), and also interact with effector T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) itself, mediating both natural antitumor immunity and the response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Using LIPSTIC (Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts)-based single-cell transcriptomics, we identify individual DCs capable of presenting antigen to CD4+ T cells in the tdLN as well as inside the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our findings reveal that DCs with similar hyperactivated transcriptional phenotypes interact with helper T cells both within tumors and in the tdLN, and that checkpoint blockade drugs enhance these interactions. These findings show that a relatively small fraction of DCs is responsible for most of the antigen presentation within the tdLN and TME to both CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T cells and that classical checkpoint blockade enhances CD40-driven DC activation at both sites.","BackgroundTumor vaccines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an area of intense interest. Tremendous clinical trials have been conducted globally, but the efficacy and security of tumor vaccines are elusive. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and security of tumor vaccines.MethodsAll relevant studies were identified in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science and Cochrane Library databases. Objective response rate (ORR), median overall survival (OS), or median progression-free survival (PFS) and 95% CI were meta-analyzed based on the random-effects model. The individual-level data of OS, PFS were pooled by conducting survival analysis. All observed adverse events were collected.Results31 studies containing 35 eligible cohorts with 932 HCC patients were included. The pooled ORR were 7% (95% CI 3–14%), while ORR of dendritic cell (DC) vaccine (19%, 95% CI 11–29%) were highly significant than ORR of peptide vaccine (1%, 95% CI 0–5%). The pooled median OS and PFS were 13.67 months (95% CI 8.20–22.80) and 6.19 months (95% CI 2.97–12.91), respectively. The pooled median OS (DC vaccine: median OS = 21.77 months, 95% CI 18.33–25.86; Peptide vaccine: median OS = 10.08 months, 95% CI 5.23–19.44) and PFS (DC vaccine: median PFS = 11.01 months, 95% CI 5.25–23.09; Peptide vaccine: median PFS = 1.97 months, 95% CI 1.53–2.54) of DC vaccine were also longer than that of peptide vaccine. HBV-related HCC may acquire more benefits from tumor vaccines than HCV-related HCC. In almost all studies, the observed toxicities were moderate even tiny.ConclusionsTumor vaccines for HCC, especially DC vaccine, are safe and worth exploring. More high-quality prospective studies are warranted.",0
"AbstractBackgroundCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is characterized by a high tumor mutational burden due to solar damage and a favorable response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Yet, we encounter tumors arising in areas with minimal sun exposure, such as cSCC that develops in chronically inflamed skin, also known as Marjolin’s Ulcer (MU). The response of MU-SCC to immunotherapy remains unknown.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with cSCC and treated with cemiplimab or pembrolizumab in a single tertiary medical center. Patients lost to follow up were excluded.ResultsOf the 84 eligible patients, 9 (11%) had MU-SCC. Of these, 2 (22%) reached partial response (PR), and none reached complete response (CR). In contrast, of the 75 patients with solar damage-related cSCC, 40 had PR (53%), and 20 had CR (26%). The difference between the two subtypes was significant (P < .001). Interestingly, 3 patients with MU-SCC received a second-line chemo-immunotherapy and experienced a partial response that continued for 5 to 21 months. Patients with MU-SCC had a significantly shorter median time to progression (TTP) (1.6 vs 51.6 months, P < .001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (1.6 vs 15.4 months, P < .001). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly shorter (17.4 vs 36.7 months, P = .096). Multivariate analysis confirmed that MU-SCC is an independent risk factor for shorter TTP (HR 5.5, 95% CI 2.2-14.0, P < .001) and PFS (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.5-8.1, P = .003).ConclusionsThis study suggests that immunotherapy is less beneficial in SCC-MU. More work is needed to verify our findings and explore other treatment options.","AbstractPannexin (PANX) channels are present in skin and facilitate the movement of signalling molecules during cellular communication. PANX1 and PANX3 function in skin homeostasis and keratinocyte differentiation but were previously reduced in a small cohort of human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) tumours compared to normal epidermis. In our study we used SCC‐13 cells, limited publicly available RNA‐seq data and a larger cohort of cSCC patient‐matched samples to analyse PANX1 and PANX3 expression and determine the association between their dysregulation and the malignant properties of cSCC. In a bioinformatics analysis, PANX1 transcripts were increased in cSCC and head and neck SCC tumours compared to normal tissues, but PANX3 mRNA showed no differences. However, in our own cohort PANX3 transcripts were decreased in cSCC compared to patient‐matched aged skin, whereas PANX1 protein was upregulated in cSCC. PANX1 localized to all regions within the cSCC tumour microenvironment, and increased levels were associated with larger tumour dimensions. To investigate PANX1 function in SCC‐13 cells, we deleted PANX1 via CRISPR/Cas9 and treated with PANX1 inhibitors, which markedly reduced cell growth and migration. To assess PANX3 function in cutaneous carcinogenesis, we employed the 7,12‐dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12‐otetradecanoylphorbol‐13‐acetate (DMBA/TPA) model using our global Panx3 knockout (KO) mice, where 60% of wild‐type and 100% of KO mice formed precancerous papillomas. Average papilloma volumes at endpoint were significantly increased in KO mice and showed moderate evidence of increases in KO mice over time. Collectively, these findings suggest PANX1 and PANX3 dysregulation may have potential tumour‐promoting and tumour‐suppressive effects for keratinocyte transformation, respectively. Key points Pannexin 1 (PANX1) and pannexin 3 (PANX3) are channel‐forming proteins which are critical in the normal maintenance and function of keratinocytes in the skin but may become altered in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) tumours.In this study we used a combination of culture models, mouse models and patient‐derived tissues. We found PANX1 levels are increased in cSCC tumours and present in all tumour regions, functioning to promote cSCC cell growth and migration.Conversely, PANX3 levels are decreased in cSCC tumours, and this protein reduces the incidence and growth of precancerous lesions.Taken together our data indicate that in cSCC these pannexin family members seem to have opposite effects, in either promoting or restricting cancer cell properties.These results help us to better understand the mechanisms of malignant transformation of keratinocytes and offer a new potential therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced cSCC.",1
"Biliary tract cancers encompass a group of malignancies that affect the bile ducts and gallbladder and are associated with a poor prognosis, often due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. The incidence of biliary tract cancer has been increasing gradually, underscoring the need for a better understanding of its pathogenesis and potential risk factors. Research suggests that biliary tract cancer may develop through a combination of genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as environmental factors. The role of microbial exposure and the human microbiome in the pathogenesis of biliary tract cancer is an emerging area of interest. Traditionally, the biliary tree was considered sterile under normal conditions, but recent studies have identified associations between specific microbiological patterns and inflammatory biliary diseases and cancer. The human microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining host homeostasis and interacting with the host's immune system. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the microbiome composition, has been implicated in the development of various diseases, including cancer. Hence, dysbiosis in the biliary tract might trigger the pathogenesis of biliary tract cancer. Advances in next-generation sequencing technology have provided researchers with a more comprehensive view of the microbiota and their potential roles in health and disease, providing more evidence of the relationship between the microbiota and biliary tract cancer. This review summarizes the latest evidence of the microbiome that would be associated with biliary tract cancer.","BackgroundTo date, no comprehensive analysis of gallbladder cancer (GBC) management has been reported. We aimed to identify the publication characteristics and research trends in managing GBC over the past three decades.MethodsWe selected the 100 most cited articles and performed a bibliometric analysis to summarize the publication characteristics, explore research hotspots, and identify research trends in the management of GBC.ResultsThe total citations of the included articles ranged from 123 to 1822. Period II (2001–2010) yielded the highest number of included articles, whereas the lowest was in Period III (2011–2020). The United States and Japan published the most papers, in which the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center and Nagoya University were the leading institutions, respectively. The most influential authors were Blumgart LH and Fong YM from the United States. Cooperation among countries, institutions, and authors was weak. The Annals of Surgery contributed the most articles with the highest number of total citations. The most researched topic was surgery, followed by systemic therapy and adjuvant therapy. Since Period I, the percentage of surgery-related publications continuously decreased (Periods II and III versus Period I, both p < 0.001), with a concomitant increase in those of adjuvant therapy (Period III versus Period I, p = 0.004) and systemic therapy (Period II versus Period I, p = 0.004; Period III versus Period I, p = 0.002).ConclusionsSurgery remains the preferred treatment, while there is a tendency toward adjuvant and systemic therapy in GBC management. An increase in local and international collaboration for managing GBC is required.",1
"Three 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) derivatives (named C4–C6) including DNJ and tegafur (TGF) were designed and synthesized, and their antiproliferative effects were investigated. C4–C6, especially C6, exerted good lipophilicity, α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and antitumor effects. Mechanism studies indicated that C6 significantly induced cell apoptosis and S-phase block and inhibited migration of HCT-116 cells. Besides, C6 induced mitochondrial damage by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, improving the accumulation of ROS, upregulating the expression of Bax, and downregulating Bcl-2. Moreover, C6 induced excessive production of ROS to trigger oxidative stress, resulting in an increase in the level of MDA and NO, a decrease in the content of GSH and SOD, and an overexpression of Nrf2. Furthermore, C6 induced DNA damage by down-regulating the expression of thymidylate synthase. These results indicated that C6 is a potential antitumor agent and kills HCT-116 cells through DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress.","PurposeThere is uncertainty regarding the role of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).MethodsWe identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICIs combined with NACT to NACT in early-stage TNBC. Efficacy outcomes included pathological complete response (pCR) and event-free survival (EFS). Toxicity data included any grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, AEs leading to death, common and meaningful AEs associated with chemotherapy and immune-related AEs. Odds ratio (ORs), hazard ratios (HR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) for efficacy and toxicity were extracted and pooled in a meta-analysis. Differences in the odds for pCR between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status and between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors were also assessed.ResultsFive RCTs comprising 2,075 patients were analyzed. Compared to NACT alone, combination of ICIs and NACT significantly improved pCR (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25–2.47, p = 0.001) and EFS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48–0.91, p = 0.01). Magnitude of effect on pCR was similar between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors (p for the subgroup difference = 0.80) and between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors (p = 0.27). The combination treatment resulted in higher odds of any grade 3/4 AEs (OR 1.31, p = 0.02) and serious AEs (OR 1.84, p = 0.006), with no statistically significant difference in AEs leading to death (OR 1.67, p = 0.51). Higher magnitude of toxicity was observed for immune-related AEs.ConclusionCombination of ICIs and NACT were associated with improved outcome in early-stage TNBC while increasing toxicity significantly. Longer follow-up is desired to better understand the risk and benefit ratio of this combination.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03591-w.",0
"Both machine learning and mechanistic modelling approaches have been used independently with great success in systems biology. Machine learning excels in deriving statistical relationships and quantitative prediction from data, while mechanistic modelling is a powerful approach to capture knowledge and infer causal mechanisms underpinning biological phenomena. Importantly, the strengths of one are the weaknesses of the other, which suggests that substantial gains can be made by combining machine learning with mechanistic modelling, a field referred to as Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). In this review we discuss recent advances in combining these two approaches for systems biology, and point out future avenues for its application in the biological sciences.","ABSTRACTCancer is increasingly being recognized as a global health issue with considerable unmet medical need. Despite the rapid progression of anticancer pharmaceuticals, there are still significant challenges for the effective management of cancer. In many circumstances, cancer cells are difficult to detect and treat. Combination of nanovesicles (NVs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), referred as magnetic nanovesicles (MNVs), is now well recognized as a potential theranostic option for improving cancer treatment outcomes and reducing adverse effects. MNVs can be used for monitoring the long-term fate and functional benefits of cancer therapy. Moreover, MNV-mediated hyperthermia mechanism has been explored as a potential technique for triggering cancer cell death, and/or controlled release of laden cargo. In this review, we focus on the unique characteristics of MNVs as a promising avenue for targeted drug delivery, diagnosis, and treatments of cancer or tumor. Moreover, we discuss critical considerations related to the issues raised in this area, which will guide future research toward better anti-cancer therapeutics for clinical applications.",0
"BackgroundLncRNAs and DNA methylation are both key regulators of tumorigenesis and immune regulation. However, the interaction between lncRNA and DNA methylation, their regulation and their clinical and immune relevance in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, we identified DNA methylation regulator-related lncRNAs through Pearson correlation analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Univariate Cox regression was used to screen DNA methylationrelated prognostic lncRNAs. Further, through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression, a prognostic model based on 13 lncRNAs was established. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis verified the accuracy of the model in predicting the survival of GC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses also confirmed that the risk score obtained from the risk model could be applied as an independent prognostic factor for patients with GC. Furthermore, based on the risk score and other clinicopathological characteristics that can be used as independent prognostic factors, we constructed a nomogram that could accurately determine the survival time of each patient. In addition, a lncRNA score was constructed using a principal component analysis algorithm to quantify the DNA methylation-related lncRNA expression patterns of individual tumors.ResultsWe found that a higher lncRNA score indicated a worse the prognosis and was associated with a reduced tumor mutation burden and immunosuppression. A low lncRNA score was related to an increase in neoantigen load and an increase in the anti-PDL1/CTLA4 immunotherapy response. Additionally, a low lncRNA score was related to a significant therapeutic advantage and clinical benefit.ConclusionsThis study describes a DNA methylation regulator-related lncRNA signature model, which provides a new approach for predicting therapeutic response and patient stratification in GC. Assessing lncRNA expression patterns in individual tumors will contribute to enhancing our understanding of tumor microenvironment infiltration and guide more effective immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05234-8.","Plain Language SummaryPatients with both BRAF V600E mutations and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have poor prognosis. Currently, there are no specifically targeted first-line treatment options indicated for patients with mCRC whose tumors harbor both molecular aberrations. Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of MSI-H/dMMR mCRC, and the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib, in combination with cetuximab, is approved for previously treated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. Combination of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab may synergistically enhance antitumor activity in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR mCRC. SEAMARK is a randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab versus pembrolizumab alone in patients with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR mCRC.Plain language summary – SEAMARK study: encorafenib & cetuximab plus pembrolizumab for people with BRAF V600E-mutant & DNA repair-deficient colorectal cancerColorectal cancer (CRC) occurs when there is an abnormal growth of cells (known as a tumor) in the colon or rectum. Some people with CRC have changes in their tumor genes (known as gene mutations). A gene is a piece of DNA that tells the cell to make specific molecules, such as proteins. Mutations in a gene called BRAF can turn on signals that help the cancer cells grow. Gene mutations that impair DNA repair mechanisms can also make the cancer cells grow more quickly and allow the immune system to detect the cancer cells as being foreign to the body. Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that turns off specific genes and proteins involved in cancer cell survival and growth. BRAF and EGFR inhibitors are targeted therapies that work well together in treating people with BRAF-mutant CRC. BRAF proteins can help cancer cells grow, and BRAF inhibitors block these proteins to prevent, slow, or stop the growth of the cancer cells. Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps a person’s immune system fight cancer. Immunotherapy is effective for treating CRC that has mutations in the DNA repair mechanisms. By combining targeted therapy and immunotherapy, patients may be able to live longer without their disease getting worse. In the SEAMARK study, we will use a treatment combination including a BRAF inhibitor (encorafenib), an EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab) and an immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) in patients with CRC who have a BRAF mutation and deficiencies in the DNA repair mechanism.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05217446 (ClinicalTrials.gov), 2021-003715-26 (EudraCT) Tweetable abstract SEAMARK (NCT05217446) is a phase II study investigating the efficacy of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.",0
"ABSTRACTAcute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous hematopoietic cancer prevalent in adults, has been a leading cause of leukemia-associated deaths for decades. Despite advancements in understanding its pathology and pharmacological targets, therapeutic strategies have seen minimal change. The standard treatment, combining cytarabine and anthracycline, has persisted, accompanied by challenges such as pharmacokinetic issues and non-specific drug delivery, leading to severe side effects. Nanotechnology offers a promising solution through combination drug delivery. FDA-approved CPX351 (VYXEOS™) a liposomal formulation delivering doxorubicin and cytarabine, exemplifies enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Ongoing research explores various nanocarriers for delivering multiple bioactives, addressing drug targeting, pharmacokinetics and chemoresistance. This review highlights nanotechnology-based combination therapies for the effective management of AML, presenting a potential breakthrough in leukemia.","Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) (∼50–150 nm) that have emerged as promising vehicles for therapeutic applications and drug delivery. These membrane-bound particles, released by all actively dividing cells, have the ability to transfer effector molecules, including proteins, RNA, and even DNA, from donor cells to recipient cells, thereby modulating cellular responses. RNA-based therapeutics, including microRNAs, messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, hold great potential in controlling gene expression and treating a spectrum of medical conditions. RNAs encapsulated in EVs are protected from extracellular degradation, making them attractive for therapeutic applications. Understanding the intricate biology of cargo loading and transfer within EVs is pivotal to unlocking their therapeutic potential. This review discusses the biogenesis and classification of EVs, methods for loading RNA into EVs, their advantages as drug carriers over synthetic-lipid-based systems, and the potential applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Notably, EVs show promise in delivering RNA cargo across the blood-brain barrier and targeting tumor cells, offering a safe and effective approach to RNA-based therapy in these contexts.",1
"BackgroundOvarian cancer (OvCa) is the most lethal of the gynecologic malignancies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have revolutionized the treatment of multiple malignancies, have had limited efficacy in OvCa patients. This lack of effectiveness is partly due to the abnormal ovarian tumor microenvironment (TME), displaying a desmoplastic, highly fibrotic extracellular matrix. High extracellular matrix deposition leads to a buildup of compressive forces that cause tumor blood vessel collapse, reduced vessel perfusion, poor delivery of drugs, and compromised trafficking of cytotoxic T-cells to these tumors.MethodsUsing two syngeneic OvCa models, we tested the effect of losartan, a widely prescribed anti-hypertensive drug, on reprogramming the TME and chemosensitizing the cancer cells.ResultsLosartan treatment (i) reprograms the TME leading to increased vascular perfusion, and thus enhances drug delivery and immune effector cell intratumoral infiltration and function; and (ii) rewires the OvCa cells by suppressing the IGF-1 signaling, resulting in enhanced chemosensitivity. As a result of the combined tumor and stromal effects, losartan treatment enhances the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in OvCa models.ConclusionThe safety and low cost ( < $1-2/day) of losartan warrant rapid translation of our findings to patients with OvCa.","ObjectiveFolate receptor alpha (FRα) is overexpressed on >90% of high-grade epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC). Targeting FRα with antibody-drug conjugates has proven utility in the platinum-resistant setting. It is also a potential therapeutic target for immuno-oncologic agents, such as peptide vaccines that work primarily via adaptive and humoral immunity. We tested the hypothesis that FRα peptide immunization could improve outcomes in patients with EOC following response to platinum-based therapy.MethodsWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TPIV200 (a multi-epitope FRα peptide vaccine admixed with GM-CSF) versus GM-CSF alone in 120 women who did not have disease progression after at least 4 cycles of first-line platinum-based therapy. Patients were vaccinated intradermally once every 4 weeks up to 6 times, followed by a boosting period of 6 vaccinations at 12-week intervals. Primary endpoints included safety, tolerability, and progression free survival (PFS).ResultsAt study termination with a median follow-up of 15.2 months (range 1.2 – 28.4 months), 68 of 119 intention-to-treat patients had disease progression (55% in TPIV200 + GM-CSF arm and 59% in GM-CSF alone arm). The median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI 8.3 – 16.6 months) with no significant difference between the treatment groups (10.9 months with TPIV200 + GM-CSF versus 11.1 months with GM-CSF, HR, 0.85; upper 90% CI 1.17]. No patient experienced a ≥ grade 3 drug-related adverse event.ConclusionTPIV200 was well tolerated but was not associated with improved PFS. Additional studies are required to uncover potential synergies using multiepitope vaccines targeting FRα.",1
"Inflammation and a dysregulated immune system are common denominators in cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) highlighted the convergence of interleukin (IL)-1β biology in cancer and CVD, and the potential of anti–IL-1β drugs for the treatment of both disease entities. Accumulating evidence further supports the role of the innate immunity members and IL-1β activators, S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in both cancer and CVD. This review outlines the common involvement of S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in cancer and CVD. Specifically, their time-, cell-, and context-dependent actions and hereto-related dichotomous role in different cancers and CVD are addressed, highlighting the need for further insights to allow tailored therapies.","The immune system is highly regulated but, when dysregulated, suboptimal protective or overly robust immune responses can lead to immune-mediated disorders. The genetic and molecular mechanisms of immune regulation are incompletely understood, impeding the development of more precise diagnostics and therapeutics for immune-mediated disorders. Recently, thousands of previously unrecognized noncanonical microprotein genes encoded by small open reading frames have been identified. Many of these microproteins perform critical functions, often in a cell- and context-specific manner. Several microproteins are now known to regulate immunity; however, the vast majority are uncharacterized. Therefore, illuminating what is often referred to as the “dark proteome,” may present opportunities to tune immune responses more precisely. Here, we review noncanonical microprotein biology, highlight recently discovered examples regulating immunity, and discuss the potential and challenges of modulating dysregulated immune responses by targeting microproteins.",1
"AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly detected cancer with a serious global health issue. The rates for incidence and mortality for CRC are alarming, especially since the prognosis is abysmal when the CRC is diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage. Both type of (modifiable/ non-modifiable) types of risk factors are established for CRC. Despite the advances in recent technology and sophisticated research, the survival rate is still meager due to delays in diagnosis. Therefore, there is urgently required to identify critical biomarkers aiming at early diagnosis and improving effective therapeutic strategies. Additionally, a complete understanding of the dysregulated pathways like PI3K/Akt, Notch, and Wnt associated with CRC progression and metastasis is very beneficial in designing a therapeutic regimen. This review article focused on the dysregulated signaling pathways, genetics and epigenetics alterations, and crucial biomarkers of CRC. This review also provided the list of clinical trials targeting signaling cascades and therapies involving small molecules. This review discusses up-to-date information on novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies alongside specific clinical trials.",0
"Atherosclerosis is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases with a high global prevalence. It is characterized by the formation of lipid-laden plaques in the arteries, which eventually lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis. While the current lipid-lowering therapies are generally effective in lowering the risk of cardiovascular events, they do not address the underlying causes of disease. Defective resolution of inflammation and impaired efferocytosis are the main driving forces of atherosclerosis. Macrophages recognize cells for clearance by the expression of “eat me” and “do not eat me” signals, including the CD47-SIRPα axis. However, the “do not eat me” signal CD47 is overexpressed in atherosclerotic plaques, leading to compromised efferocytosis and secondary necrosis. In this context, prophagocytic antibodies have been explored to stimulate the clearance of apoptotic cells, but they are nonspecific and impact healthy tissues. In macrophages, downstream of signal regulatory protein α, lie protein tyrosine phosphatases, SHP 1/2, which can serve as effective targets for selectively phagocytosing apoptotic cells. While increasing the efferocytosis targets the end stages of lesion development, the underlying issue of inflammation still persists. Simultaneously increasing efferocytosis and reducing inflammation can be effective therapeutic strategies for managing atherosclerosis. For instance, IL-10 is a key anti-inflammatory mediator that enhances efferocytosis via phosphoSTAT3 (pSTAT3) activation. In this study, we developed a combination nanotherapy by encapsulating an SHP-1 inhibitor (NSC 87877) and IL-10 in a single nanoparticle platform [(S + IL)-NPs] to enhance efferocytosis and inflammation resolution. Our studies suggest that (S + IL)-NPs successfully encapsulated both agents, entered the macrophages, and delivered the agents into intracellular compartments. Additionally, (S + IL)-NPs decreased inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory markers and enhancing anti-inflammatory mediators. They also exhibited the potential for improved phagocytic activity via pSTAT3 activation. Our nanomedicine-mediated upregulation of the anti-inflammatory and efferocytic responses in macrophages shows promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the top ten leading causes of cancer-related death in India, with recent reports suggesting a rising incidence. Chronic HBV infection is still the commonest cause of HCC in India but the recent surge of MASLD and better control of viral hepatitis is already changing the epidemiology. Most HCC in India are diagnosed at an advanced stage where cure is impossible, and prognosis is poor. These factors force us to rethink strategies for surveillance and diagnosis of early stage HCC in India.Current guidelines including from INASL, suggest six-monthly surveillance using abdominal ultrasound (USG) with or without Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) testing. This strategy has several limitations, especially in patients with MASLD. Also, HCC surveillance is neither well-organized nor universally practiced in India. The current screening approach, therefore needs a radical change. The Japanese guidelines provide a template for a successful model for increasing the diagnosis of early HCC. Tumor markers like PIVKA II, and newer algorithms like the GALAD and the GAAD scores could refine the surveillance strategies in the coming years, as shown by emerging data from Thailand and China. Moving away from hospital-based imaging towards community-based use of blood markers and digital technology may be a potential solution to help reach at-risk populations.Healthcare economics and logistics will play a big part in implementation of a radical new strategy, and a nationwide chronic liver disease and HCC registry is needed to evaluate current practices, define populations at risk, and identify the best beneficiaries of surveillance in a resource-constrained setting like India. We also concurrently need to identify, upgrade or develop statewide centers of excellence to provide state-of-the-art integrated multidisciplinary care to patients who get diagnosed through surveillance pathways to actually improve patient outcomes.",0
"ABSTRACTMalignant tumors including gastric cancer (GC) are the leading cause of deaths among reproductive women. Physiological morning sickness can mask the clinical manifestations of GC, whereas the clinical presence of metastatic tumors in the abdominal cavity may be easily mistaken for abdominal swelling caused by fetal growth. Pregnancy and delivery processes in young females could accelerate the growth of GC, leading to its rapid development and grave prognosis. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical and gastrointestinal endoscopy is recommended for any suspected pregnant woman with long-term morning sickness. Treatment strategies, including chemotherapy, resection surgery and radiotherapy, will be determined based on a comprehensive consideration of the status of both the fetus and the mother. Rational management, especially clinical multidisciplinary collaboration may significantly benefit such patients.","Problem:Vaccination in pregnancy guards against infection. Maternal antibodies, however, can inhibit antibody production in neonates. We sought to determine the effects of maternal vaccination on neonatal immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.Method of Study:We hypothesized that mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNP) vaccination allows for a de novo neonatal antibody response even in the presence of vertically transmitted maternal antibodies. Female mice were vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA-LNPs. Mice were then bred, and 21-day-old pups were inoculated with the same mRNA-LNPs. Spike-specific IgG ELISAs were performed using mouse serum. A SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide library to perform peptide ELISAs characterized high affinity binding domains within the spike protein. Results were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests.Results:Compared to pups of unvaccinated dams, there were high levels of spike-specific IgG detected in the pups of vaccinated dams at 3 weeks of life (p < 0.0001). After neonatal vaccination, pups of unvaccinated dams had higher spike-specific serum IgG than pups of vaccinated dams at 12 weeks of life (p < 0.001). Antibody specificity to peptide moieties within spike RBD were similar when comparing a vaccinated dam to her pup at Week 3 of life, with different binding affinities observed in the pups by Week 15 of life.Conclusions:Pre-existing maternal antibodies may partially blunt the initial neonatal antibody response to mRNA-LNPs vaccination. This vaccine strategy, however, does not prohibit the subsequent development of a broad range of RBD antibody specificities that may be protective.",1

However, its clinical significance in different tumor types is not fully understood. To assess its therapeutic efficacy and immunomodulatory properties, we compared HIFU thermal ablation and histotripsy ablation in dogs with spontaneous tumors. We also evaluated the ability of non-ablative HIFU-based mild hyperthermia (40–45 °C) to improve Doxorubicin delivery and immunomodulation. Our results showed that HIFU thermal ablation induced tumor remission in the majority of treated patients over 60 days, while histotripsy achieved partial response to stable disease persistence. The adverse effects of thermal ablation were minor to moderate, while histotripsy exposures were relatively well-tolerated. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between HIFU-therapeutic response and serum anti-tumor cytokine profiles and the presence of functionally active cytotoxic immune cells in patients. Similarly, Doxorubicin-treated patients showed improved drug delivery, efficacy, and anti-tumor immune responses with HIFU hyperthermia. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that depending on the tumor type and treatment parameters, HIFU treatments can enable tumor growth control, immune activation, and chemotherapy in veterinary patient. These findings have significant clinical implications and highlight the potential of HIFU as a promising cancer treatment approach.",1
"PurposeThe anti-inflammatory environment of glioma reduces the efficacy of immunotherapies. Therefore, it is vital to transform the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma into a pro-inflammatory environment. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) can serve as immune checkpoint targets that enhance the anti-tumor immune response. However, the roles of Siglecs in the glioma microenvironment are unknown. This study was conducted to identify targets to inhibit the anti-inflammatory environment to improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with glioma.MethodsWe analyzed the regulatory effect of prognosis-related Siglecs identified from data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) and China Glioma Genome Atlas Data portal on the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma. The effects of prognosis-related Siglecs on the glioma microenvironment were investigated by determining the Pearson correlation coefficients of the Siglecs in transcriptome data from the TCGA database.ResultsSiglec-1, -9, -10, and -14 were closely associated with the prognosis of patients with glioma. The expression of these four Siglecs was significantly increased in the high-risk group and positively correlated with anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in the glioma microenvironment.ConclusionOur study provides insights into the effects of prognosis-related Siglecs in glioma immunotherapy, suggesting that targeted prognosis-related Siglecs can modify the microenvironment of glioma and improve the sensitivity of patients with glioma to immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03762-9.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that perform post-transcriptional gene regulation. This review focuses on the role of tumor cell-derived miRNAs in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) via receptor cell recoding, including angiogenesis, expression of immunosuppressive molecules, formation of radiation resistance, and chemoresistance. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of these molecules as adjuvant therapies in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy, as well as their advantages as efficacy predictors for personalized therapy. MiRNA-based therapeutic agents for tumors are currently in clinical trials, and while challenges remain, additional research on tumor-derived miRNAs is warranted, which may provide significant clinical benefits to cancer patients.",1
"AbstractInverted papillomas (IP) are rare sinonasal tumors (Schneiderian papillomas) characterized by local invasion, with high recurrence rates and potential for malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC ex‐IP). Traditionally, the mainstay of treatment has been surgical resection, often challenging due to invasion of the skull base or vital neurovascular structures. In advanced cases, prognosis is poorer and radiation therapy is the current standard of care with limited role of systemic therapy. We present a case of unresectable SCC ex‐IP treated with sequential chemoradiation and PD‐1 immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and achieving complete response at 1 year. This case suggests that immunotherapy can effectively treat SCC ex‐IP and we propose that programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) testing should be performed in all advanced cases. Prospective studies are needed to validate immunotherapy in adjuvant or frontline treatments for advanced SCC ex‐IP, and the role of PD‐L1 as a predictive biomarker.","ObjectiveTo search for human protein-coding genes related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and perform prognosis risk assessment.MethodsGenes related to HBV-HCC were selected through literature screening and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network database analysis. Prognosis potential genes (PPGs) were identified using Cox regression analysis. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on PPGs, and risk scores were calculated. Kaplan–Meier plots were used to analyze overall survival rates, and the results were predicted based on clinicopathological variables. Association analysis was also conducted with immune infiltration, immune therapy, and drug sensitivity. Experimental verification of the expression of PPGs was done in patient liver cancer tissue and normal liver tissue adjacent to tumors.ResultsThe use of a prognosis potential genes risk assessment model can reliably predict the prognosis risk of patients, demonstrating strong predictive ability. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the overall survival rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than that of the high-risk group. There were significant differences between the two subgroups in terms of immune infiltration and IC50 association analysis. Experimental verification revealed that CYP2C19, FLNC, and HNRNPC were highly expressed in liver cancer tissue, while UBE3A was expressed at a lower level.ConclusionPPGs can be used to predict the prognosis risk of HBV-HCC patients and play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. They also reveal their potential role in the tumor immune microenvironment, clinical-pathological characteristics, and prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04989-4.",0
"AbstractIntroductionImmunotherapy is the first-line treatment for intermediate-advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although its outcomes vary. This study aimed to identify imaging biomarkers of immunotherapy susceptibility linked to gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) and immune phenotypes, particularly immune-excluded phenotypes, with a tumor immune barrier.MethodsWe performed immunohistochemical staining with a CD8+ antibody, and samples were classified into immune-inflamed, -intermediate, -excluded, and -ignored phenotypes. We assessed EOB-MRI findings obtained from 104 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC and evaluated the relationship between MRI findings and immune phenotype. Spatial transcriptome analysis of tumor tissues in each immune phenotype was performed to characterize the MRI findings. For validation, we analyzed the treatment effect on 60 nodules in another cohort of 27 patients who received combined immunotherapy using anti-programmed death-ligand 1 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies.ResultsHCCs with rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) (odds ratio [OR] 17.3, p = 0.009), peritumoral enhancement in the arterial phase (OR: 8.6, p < 0.004), and intermediate intensity on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) measured with a visual 3-point scale (OR: 28.2, p = 0.002) were associated with immune-excluded phenotype, where tumors tended to be larger and of the single nodular type with extranodular growth and confluent multinodular rather than the simple nodular type. Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed a spatial relationship among cytotoxic T lymphocytes, VEGF signals, and cancer-associated fibroblasts at the tumor-invasive margins in this phenotype. From the validation study, nodules with any one of these three imaging findings had a significantly prolonged time to-nodular progression (p = 0.007, median not reached vs. 226 days).ConclusionHCCs with rim APHE, peritumoral enhancement in arterial phase, and intermediate intensity on HBP with visual 3-point scale could be non-invasive biomarkers to predict the immune-excluded phenotype with the tumor immune barrier. These HCCs were most likely to respond to combined immunotherapy.","ABSTRACTObjective:The term post-COVID (coronavirus disease) is used to refer to the presence of prolonged symptoms 12 weeks or more after the disease treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of symptoms and anxiety in patients with COVID-19 who did not require inpatient care at the third and sixth months following symptom onset.Materials and Methods:The study is a prospective cohort study involving 471 university employees who contracted COVID-19 between October 2020 and October 2021. Data were obtained through the disease contact follow-up program implemented at the university and phone interviews conducted at the third and sixth months from symptom onset.Results:The study group comprised 361 individuals at three months and 109 at six months from symptom onset. The study found that symptoms persisted in 116 (32.1%) people in the third month and in 47 (13.0%) people in the sixth month. The most common symptoms at three months were shortness of breath, fatigue, and fatigue, while fatigue, fatigue, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms at six months.Conclusion:Understanding the long-term effects of coronavirus will enhance the management of the disease. As a result, the follow-up of symptomatic COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients will become more systematic and effective.",0
"ABSTRACTAdoptive cell therapy (ACT) is on the horizon as a thrilling therapeutic plan for cancer. However, widespread application of ACT is often restricted by several challenges, including complexity of priming tumor-specific T cells and poor trafficking in solid tumors. The convergence of nanotechnology and cancer immunotherapy is coming of age and could address the limitations of ACT. Recent studies have provided evidence on the application of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to generate smart immune cells and to bypass problems associated with conventional ACT. Herein, we review current progress in the application of MNPs to improve preparing, guiding and tracking immune cells in cancer ACT. Besides, we comment on the challenges ahead and strategies to optimize MNPs for clinical settings.","Ovarian cancers are a complex and heterogenic group of malignancies that are difficult to detect, diagnose and treat. Fortunately, considerable knowledge of ovarian cancer specific biomarkers has been generated, that is pertinent to the development of novel theranostic platforms by combining therapies and diagnostics. Genomic and proteomic data has been invaluable in providing critical biomolecular targets for ovarian cancer theranostic approaches. Exploitation of the wealth of biomarker research that has been conducted offers viable targets as beacons for ovarian cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic targeting. These markers can be used in theranostics, a treatment strategy that combines therapy and diagnostics and is common in nuclear medicine, where radionuclides are used for both diagnosis and treatment. The development of theranostics has taken substantial focus in recent years in the battle against ovarian cancer. Yet to date only one theranostic technology has emerged in clinical practice. However, given the wealth of ovarian cancer biomarkers the field is poised to see the emergence of revolutionary disease treatment and monitoring outcomes through their incorporation into the development of theranostic strategies. The future of ovarian cancer treatment is set to enable precise diagnosis, targeted treatment, and vigilant monitoring. This review aims to assess the status of ovarian cancer diagnostic tools and biomarkers in practice, clinical development, or pre-clinical development, highlighting newly emerging theranostic applications.",1
"BACKGROUND:Cancer is a dynamic process and thus requires highly informative and reliable biomarkers to help guide patient care. Liquid-based biopsies have emerged as a clinical tool for tracking cancer dynamics. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipid bilayer delimited particles secreted by cells, are a new class of liquid-based biomarkers. EVs are rich in selectively sorted biomolecule cargos, which provide a spatiotemporal fingerprint of the cell of origin, including cancer cells.CONTENT:This review summarizes the performance characteristics of EV-based biomarkers at different stages of cancer progression, from early malignancy to recurrence, while emphasizing their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and screening biomarkers. We discuss the characteristics of effective biomarkers, consider challenges associated with the EV biomarker field, and report guidelines based on the biomarker discovery pipeline.SUMMARY:Basic science and clinical trial studies have shown the potential of EVs as precision-based biomarkers for tracking cancer status, with promising applications for diagnosing disease, predicting response to therapy, and tracking disease burden. The multi-analyte cargos of EVs enhance the performance characteristics of biomarkers. Recent technological advances in ultrasensitive detection of EVs have shown promise with high specificity and sensitivity to differentiate early-cancer cases vs healthy individuals, potentially outperforming current gold-standard imaging-based cancer diagnosis. Ultimately, clinical translation will be dictated by how these new EV biomarker-based platforms perform in larger sample cohorts. Applying ultrasensitive, scalable, and reproducible EV detection platforms with better design considerations based upon the biomarker discovery pipeline should guide the field towards clinically useful liquid biopsy biomarkers.","AbstractBackgroundGlioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary central nervous system tumor characterized by poor outcomes. In case of relapse or progression to adjuvant chemotherapy, there is no univocal preferred regimen for relapsing glioblastoma.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and Bayesian trial-level network meta-analyses (NMA) to identify the regimens associated with the best outcomes. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR). We estimated separate treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values. Only phase II/III prospective comparative trials were included.ResultsTwenty-four studies (3733 patients and 27 different therapies) were ultimately included. Twenty-three different regimens were compared for OS, 21 for PFS, and 26 for ORR. When taking lomustine as a common comparator, only regorafenib was likely to be significantly superior in terms of OS (hazard ratio: 0.50, 95% credible interval: 0.33-0.75). Regorafenib was significantly superior to other 16 (69.6%) regimens, including NovoTTF-100A, bevacizumab monotherapy, and several bevacizumab-based combinations. Regarding PFS and ORR, no treatment was clearly superior to the others.ConclusionsThis NMA supports regorafenib as one of the best available options for relapsing/refractory glioblastoma. Lomustine, NovoTTF-100A, and bevacizumab emerge as other viable alternative regimens. However, evidence on regorafenib is controversial at best. Moreover, most studies were underpowered, with varying inclusion criteria and primary endpoints, and no longer adapted to the most recent glioblastoma classification. A paradigmatic change in clinical trials’ design for relapsing/refractory glioblastoma and more effective treatments are urgently required.",0
"AbstractMiniproteins constitute an excellent basis for the development of structurally demanding functional molecules. The engrailed homeodomain, a three‐helix‐containing miniprotein, was applied as a scaffold for constructing programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) interaction inhibitors. PD‐L1 binders were initially designed using the computer‐aided approach and subsequently optimized iteratively. The conformational stability was assessed for each obtained miniprotein using circular dichroism spectroscopy, indicating that numerous mutations could be introduced. The formation of a sizable hydrophobic surface at the inhibitor that fits the molecular target imposed the necessity for the incorporation of additional charged amino acid residues to retain its appropriate solubility. Finally, the miniprotein effectively binding to PD‐L1 (K D = 51.4 nM) that inhibits PD‐1/PD‐L1 interaction in cell‐based studies with EC50 = 3.9 μM, was discovered.","BackgroundCombination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chemotherapy (ICI + chemotherapy) has become the standard first line treatment for driver oncogene-negative advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it may be more toxic compared to monotherapy, which limits its use. Moreover, the feasibility of the combination therapy in clinical practice remains unknown.MethodsWe conducted a cohort study to determine the implementation rate of ICI + chemotherapy in clinical practice. We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from advanced NSCLC patients who received systemic therapy at 13 institutions between December 2018 and December 2020.ResultsAfter excluding 154 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene alterations, a total of 919 NSCLC patients were included. Among them, 442 were treated with ICI + chemotherapy (48%), whereas 477 were treated with other therapies (52%). Among these 477 patients, 340 did not receive ICI + chemotherapy because of intolerance (71%); thus, more than one-third of the advanced NSCLC patients do not benefit from the combination therapy due to intolerance. Among the 659 NSCLC patients for whom PD-L1 was < 50% or unknown, only 342 received the ICI + chemotherapy combination (52%) even though it is considered preferable to either therapy alone; the remaining 318 patients were treated with other therapies (48%). Among the 318 patients who did not receive ICI + chemotherapy, 274 were intolerant to it (86%).ConclusionOur results revealed that a substantial proportion of advanced NSCLC patients did not benefit from ICI + chemotherapy due to intolerance. As treatments for NSCLC are moving toward combinations for greater efficacy, their feasibility in clinical practice must be taken into consideration.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04415-1.",0
"KRAS is an important oncogenic driver which is mutated in numerous cancers. Recent advances in the selective targeting of KRAS mutants via small molecule inhibitors and targeted protein degraders have generated an increase in research activity in this area in recent years. As such, there is a need for new assay platforms to profile next generation inhibitors which improve on the potency and selectivity of existing drug candidates, while evading the emergence of resistance. Here, we describe the development of a new panel of biochemical and cell-based assays to evaluate the binding and function of known chemical entities targeting mutant KRAS. Our assay panels generated selectivity profiles and quantitative binding interaction dissociation constants for small molecules and degraders against wild type, G12C, G12D, and G12V KRAS, which were congruent with published data. These assays can be leveraged for additional mutants of interest beyond those described in this study, using both overexpressed cell-free systems and cell-based systems with endogenous protein levels.","KRAS mutations play a critical role in the development and progression of several cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Despite advancements in targeted therapies, the management of KRAS-mutant tumors remains challenging. This study leverages bibliometric analysis and a comprehensive review of clinical trials to identify emerging immunotherapies and potential treatments for KRAS-related cancers. Using the Web of Science Core Collection and Citespace, we analyzed publications from January 2008 to March 2023 alongside 52 clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO’s registry, concentrating on immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) and novel therapies. Our study highlights an increased focus on the tumor immune microenvironment and precision therapy. Clinical trials reveal the effectiveness of ICBs and the promising potential of T-cell receptor T-cell therapy and vaccines in treating KRAS-mutant cancers. ICBs, particularly in combination therapies, stand out in managing KRAS-mutant tumors. Identifying the tumor microenvironment and gene co-mutation profiles as key research areas, our findings advocate for multidisciplinary approaches to advance personalized cancer treatment. Future research should integrate genetic, immunological, and computational studies to unveil new therapeutic targets and refine treatment strategies for KRAS-mutant cancers.",1
ABSTRACTMedulloblastoma (MB) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in children. MB originates from neural precursor cells in distinctive regions of the rhombic lip and their maturation occurs in the cerebellum or the brain stem during embryonal development. Autophagy is also referred to as self-eating’ which is a catabolic process that often triggers cellular homeostasis through the salvaging of degenerated proteins as well as organelles. Autophagy influence cell survival via aberrant proteins that could accumulate within the cell and influence potential signaling and transport mechanisms. The role of autophagy in MB aggressiveness as well as tumorigenesis is a very complex process. This review targets specifically data reporting the key roles of autophagy in the pathogenesis and therapy of MB.,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia among the elderly, affects numerous individuals worldwide. Despite advances in understanding the molecular underpinnings of AD pathology, effective treatments to prevent or cure the disease remain elusive. AD is characterized not only by pathological hallmarks such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also by impairments in synaptic physiology, circuit activity and cognitive function. Synaptic homeostatic plasticity plays a vital role in maintaining the stability of synaptic and neural functions amid genetic and environmental disturbances. A key component of this regulation is presynaptic homeostatic potentiation, where increased presynaptic neurotransmitter release compensates for reduced postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, thereby stabilizing neuronal excitability. The role of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity in synapse stabilization in AD, however, remains unclear. Moreover, recent advances in transcriptomics have illuminated the complex roles of glial cells in regulating synaptic function in ageing brains and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the impact of AD-related abnormalities in glial signalling on synaptic homeostatic plasticity has not been fully delineated. This review discusses recent findings on how glial dysregulation in AD affects presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. There is increasing evidence that disrupted glial signalling, particularly through aberrant histone acetylation and transcriptomic changes in glia, compromises this plasticity in AD. Notably, the sphingosine signalling pathway has been identified as being protective in stabilizing synaptic physiology through epigenetic and homeostatic mechanisms, presenting potential therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",1
"Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a groundbreaking method of treating malignancies. However, cancer immunotherapy can only benefit a small percentage of patients, and the numerous side effects that might develop during treatment reduce its effectiveness or even put patients' lives in jeopardy. Surprisingly, the gut microbiome Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) can significantly inhibit carcinogenesis and improve anti-tumor effects, thus increasing the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy and decreasing the likelihood of side effects. In this review, we focus on the effects of A. muciniphila on the human immune system and the positive impacts of A. muciniphila on cancer immunotherapy, which can build on strengths and improve weaknesses of cancer immunotherapy. The potential clinical applications of A. muciniphila on cancer immunotherapy are also proposed, which have great prospects for anti-tumor therapy.","B-cell lymphomas occur with an incidence of 20 new cases per 100.000 per year in the Western world.

"ABSTRACTBackgroundRecently, we developed AT101, an IgM-class mouse monoclonal antibody directed against glypican-1 (GPC1), a proteoglycan that can be considered as useful target for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment being specifically and highly expressed on GBM cell surface. Here, we proposed the use of AT101 as targeting agent in a drug delivery nanoplatfom to effectively deliver chitosan nanobubbles (NBs) for GBM treatment.MethodsChitosan NBs were prepared and conjugated with AT101 or left unconjugated as control.ResultsThe ability of AT101 to bind the GPC1 protein was demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis in the “GBM-like” GPC1-expressing cell lines U-87 MG and T98G. AT101 was shown to bind GPC1-expressing GBM tumor samples by immunofluorescence. In-vivo experiments in the U-87 MG xenograft model showed that AT101 was able to bind GPC1 on cell surface and accumulate in U-87 MG tumor masses (p = 0.0002 respect to control). Moreover, in-vivo experiments showed that AT101 is able to target GPC1 when conjugated to chitosan NBs, thus increasing their specific deliver to GPC1-expressing cells of U-87 MG tumor, as compared to chitosan NBs not conjugated to AT101 (p = 0.02).ConclusionsAT101 is an useful targeting agent for the development of drug delivery nanoplatforms for GBM treatment.","Immunoglobulin G 3 (IgG3) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are high-value scaffolds for developing novel therapies. Despite their wide-ranging therapeutic potential, IgG3 physicochemical properties and developability characteristics remain largely under-characterized. Protein–protein interactions elevate solution viscosity in high-concentration formulations, impacting physicochemical stability, manufacturability, and the injectability of mAbs. Therefore, in this manuscript, the key molecular descriptors and biophysical properties of a model anti-IL-8 IgG1 and its IgG3 ortholog are characterized. A computational and experimental framework was applied to measure molecular descriptors impacting their downstream developability. Findings from this approach underpin a detailed understanding of the molecular characteristics of IgG3 mAbs as potential therapeutic entities. This work is the first report examining the manufacturability of IgG3 for high-concentration mAb formulations. While poorer conformational and colloidal stability and elevated solution viscosity were observed for IgG3, future efforts controlling surface potential through sequence-engineering of solvent-accessible patches can be used to improve biophysical parameters that dictate mAb developability.",1
"IntroductionProteomics technology platforms offer an extremely useful tool for the discovery of new cancer biomarkers. Secreted proteins play important roles in signal transduction, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the molecular signatures of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by quantitative proteomics using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).Material and methodsIn this study, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to analyse the secretome of HCC tissues to identify plasma biomarkers. Serum-free conditioned media (CM) were collected from the primary cultures of cancerous tissues, the surrounding noncancerous tissues, and distal noncancerous tissues.ResultsA proteomic analysis of the CM proteins allowed for a total of 5214 identified proteins, of which 190 and 44 proteins were dysregulated in the HCC tissues/distal noncancerous tissues (HCC/DN group) and the adjacent noncancerous tissues/distal noncancerous tissues (AN/DN group) compared with the distal noncancerous tissues. The dysregulated proteins in the HCC/DN group were concentrated in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling, but the dysregulated proteins in the AN/DN group were more concentrated in the basal material metabolism.ConclusionsThe secretome profile alternations and signalling pathways were associated with HCC incidence and development. The dysregulated proteins in the HCC/DN group were concentrated in the MAPK signalling and JAK-STAT signalling, but the dysregulated proteins in the AN/DN group were more concentrated in the basal material metabolism.","During eukaryotic gene expression, alternative splicing of messenger RNA precursors is critical in increasing protein diversity and regulatory complexity. Multiple transcript isoforms could be produced by alternative splicing from a single gene; they could eventually be translated into protein isoforms with deleted, added, or altered domains or produce transcripts containing premature termination codons that could be targeted by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Alternative splicing can generate proteins with similar, different, or even opposite functions. Increasingly strong evidence indicates that abnormal RNA splicing is a prevalent and crucial occurrence in cellular differentiation, tissue advancement, and the development and progression of cancer. Aberrant alternative splicing could affect cancer cell activities such as growth, apoptosis, invasiveness, drug resistance, angiogenesis, and metabolism. This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of abnormal RNA alternative splicing on the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.",0
"Aim: To investigate the different impact of each component of lipid profile in advanced cancer patients treated with immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) according to neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) value.Methods: We retrospectively collected total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL).Results: 407 patients were enrolled. In NLR <4 subgroup, TGs <150 mg/dl led to longer PFS (p = 0.01) and OS (p = 0.02) compared with TGs ≥150 mg/dl; LDL <100 mg/dl led to longer PFS (p = 0.004) and OS (p = 0.007) compared with LDL ≥100 mg/dl. In NLR ≥4 subgroup, TC >200 mg/dl led to longer PFS (p = 0.008) and OS (p = 0.004) compared with TC <200 mg/dl.Conclusion: We showed a distinct prognostic impact of lipid profile according to NLR.","Metastasis remains the primary cause of cancer-related death. The succession of events that characterize the metastatic cascade presents multiple opportunities for therapeutic intervention, and the ability to accurately model them in mice is critical to evaluate their effects. Here, a step-by-step protocol is presented for the establishment of orthotopic primary breast tumors and the subsequent monitoring of the establishment and growth of metastatic lesions in the lung using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. This methodology allows for the evaluation of treatment or its biological effects along the entire range of metastatic development, from primary tumor escape to outgrowth in the lungs. Breast orthotopic tumors are generated in mice via injection of a luciferase-labeled cell suspension in the 4th mammary gland. Tumors are allowed to grow and disseminate for a specific amount of time and are then surgically resected. Upon resection, spontaneous lung metastasis is detected, and the growth over time is monitored using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. At the desired experimental endpoint, lung tissue can be collected for downstream analysis. The treatment of established, clinically evident metastasis is critical to improve outcomes for stage IV cancer patients, and it can be evaluated through tail vein models of experimental lung metastasis. However, metastatic dissemination occurs early in breast cancer, and many patients have latent, subclinical disseminated disease after surgery. Utilization of spontaneous models such as this one provides the opportunity to study the whole spectrum of the disease, especially the systemic effects driven by treatment of the primary tumor such as pre-metastatic niche priming, and evaluate treatments on dormant and subclinical disease after surgery.",0
"Introduction:ERBB2 or HER2 alterations are found in approximately 2% to 5% of NSCLCs; most are exon 20 insertion mutations. The efficacy and safety of poziotinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, were assessed in patients with treatment-naive NSCLC whose tumors harbor HER2 exon 20 insertions.Methods:ZENITH20 is an open-label, multicohort, multicenter, global, phase 2 trial. ZENITH20-C4 enrolled treatment-naive patients with NSCLC with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 insertions. Poziotinib was administered 16 mg once daily (QD) or 8 mg twice daily (BID). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review. Secondary and exploratory end points included disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety.Results:A total of 80 patients (16 mg QD, n = 47; 8 mg BID, n = 33) were treated in ZENITH20-C4. ORR was 39% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28%–50%; 31 of 80), with a disease control rate of 73% (95% CI: 61%–82%; 58 of 80); 80% of the patients experienced tumor reduction. Median duration of response was 5.7 (95% CI: 4.6–11.9) months, and median progression-free survival was 5.6 (95% CI: 5.4–7.3) months. The most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were rash (QD, 45%; BID, 39%), stomatitis (QD, 21%; BID, 15%), and diarrhea (QD, 15%; BID, 21%). Among all subtypes of HER2 exon 20 insertions, seven patients (9%) harboring tumors with G778_P780dupGSP had the best clinical outcomes (ORR, 71%).Conclusions:Poziotinib was found to have clinically meaningful efficacy with a manageable toxicity profile for patients with treatment-naive NSCLC harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations.","BackgroundFurmonertinib is a novel third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). A phase Ib study (FAVOUR, NCT04858958) initially demonstrated the efficacy of furmonertinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins). This study aimed to investigate the real-world efficacy and safety of furmonertinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex20ins.MethodsWe retrospectively examined patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex20ins having complete follow-up data, who were treated with furmonertinib from April 14, 2021, to March 15, 2022, at our institution and multiple hospitals in China. Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates and treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were assessed.ResultsThis study included 53 patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex20ins. A767_V769dup (28.3%) and S768_D770dup (11.3%) are the major variants. The ORR and DCR were 37.7% (20/53) and 92.5% (49/53), respectively. The 6-month PFS rate was 69.4% (95% CI 53.7–85.1%). The ORR of patients in the 240 mg once-daily dosage group was higher (42.9%) than that of patients in the 80 mg once-daily (25.0%) and 160 mg once-daily (39.5%) groups, but with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.816). The ORR of furmonertinib is not dependent on insertion location (P = 0.893). Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline responded similarly to those without CNS metastases (ORR: 33.3% vs. 40.6%, P = 0.773). The most common AEs were diarrhea (26.4%) and rash (26.4%). No grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were observed. No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of TRAEs between dosage groups (P = 0.271).ConclusionsFurmonertinib has shown encouraging antitumor activity and CNS activity in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex20ins. Moreover, furmonertinib had a good safety profile and no dose-dependent toxicity.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04726-x.",1
"BackgroundNeuroinflammation participates in the pathogenesis of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); however, no effective treatments exist. MicroRNAs regulate several aspects of neuronal dysfunction. In a previous study, we found that exosomal miR-486-3p is involved in the pathophysiology of SAH. Targeted delivery of miR-486-3p without blood-brain barrier (BBB) restriction to alleviate SAH is a promising neuroinflammation approach.MethodsIn this study, we modified exosomes (Exo) to form an RVG-miR-486-3p-Exo (Exo/miR) to achieve targeted delivery of miR-486-3p to the brain. Neurological scores, brain water content, BBB damage, flow cytometry and FJC staining were used to determine the effect of miR-486-3p on SAH. Western blot analysis, ELISA and RT-qPCR were used to measure relevant protein and mRNA levels. Immunofluorescence staining and laser confocal detection were used to measure the expression of mitochondria, lysosomes and autophagosomes, and transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the level of mitophagy in the brain tissue of mice after SAH.ResultsTail vein injection of Exo/miR improved targeting of miR-486-3p to the brains of SAH mice. The injection reduced levels of neuroinflammation-related factors by changing the phenotype switching of microglia, inhibiting the expression of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) and enhancing mitophagy. miR-486-3p treatment alleviated neurobehavioral disorders, brain oedema, BBB damage and neurodegeneration. Further research found that the mechanism was achieved by regulating the acetylation level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator l alpha (PGC-1α) after SIRT2 enters the nucleus.ConclusionExo/miR treatment attenuates neuroinflammation after SAH by inhibiting SIRT2 expression and stimulating mitophagy, suggesting potential clinical applications.","PurposeWe aimed to investigate whether induction chemotherapy with less than four courses is as effective as induction chemotherapy with more than four courses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy.MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 249 patients with NSCLC who received chemoimmunotherapy at 12 centers in Japan between January and December 2019. The patient group that completed less than four courses owing to adverse events (AEs), and received subsequent maintenance therapy was compared to the group that received at least four courses of induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsOn univariate and multivariate analyses, the patient group that transitioned to maintenance therapy after completing less than four courses of induction chemotherapy had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those who completed at least four courses (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.38–3.37, p < 0.001 and HR 2.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.40–3.84, p = 0.001, respectively). There was no obvious difference in PFS between the group in which induction chemotherapy ended in two or three courses leading to partial or complete response, and the group that continued at least four courses of induction chemotherapy (log-rank test p = 0.53).ConclusionTreatment efficacy may be maintained if induction chemotherapy is completed in less than four courses owing to development of AEs, and is administered for more than two courses with partial or complete response; efficacy is maintained even on transitioning to maintenance therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03782-5.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated myocarditis is a rare but severe complication for patients treated with immunotherapy. This study aims to explore the predictive significance of patients’ clinical features and examination results for the severity of ICI-associated myocarditis.MethodsData from a real-world cohort of 81 cancer patients who developed ICI-associated myocarditis after immunotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. The development of myocarditis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3–5 and/or the major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was set as endpoints. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive value of each factor.ResultsCTCAE grades 3–5 and MACE developed in 43/81 (53.1%) and 28/81 (34.6%) cases, respectively. The likelihood of CTCAE grades 3–5 and MACE increased with the accumulation of organs affected by the ICI-associated adverse events and initial clinical symptoms. Concurrent systematic therapies during ICI treatment did not raise the risk of myocarditis severity, while prior chemotherapy did. Besides classical serum cardiac markers, a higher neutrophil ratio was also related to poorer cardiac outcomes, whereas higher lymphocyte and monocyte ratios were predictors of favorable cardiac outcomes. The CD4+ T cell ratio and CD4/CD8 ratio were negatively related to CTCAE grades 3–5. Several cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters were associated with myocarditis severity, whereas the predictive value of echocardiography and electrocardiogram was weak.ConclusionThis study comprehensively evaluated the prognostic value of patients’ clinical characteristics and examination results and identified several predictors of severe ICI-associated myocarditis, which will facilitate early detection of severe ICI-associated myocarditis in patients receiving immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04782-3.","Objective.HER2 is an important prognostic and therapeutic target in uterine serous carcinoma (USC). Optimal HER2 testing platforms have not been defined and guidelines for testing have changed over time. Our objective is to assess the concordance of HER2 positivity based on chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and next generation sequencing (NGS) and to determine the rate of downstream mutations that may affect response to HER2 directed therapy.Methods.Utilizing the Caris tumor registry, 2192 USC tumors were identified and analyzed using NGS (NextSeq, 592 Genes and WES, NovaSEQ), IHC, and CISH. PD-L1 expression was tested by IHC. Microsatellite instability was tested by fragment analysis, IHC, and NGS. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was measured by totaling somatic mutations per tumor. HER2 positivity through IHC and CISH was determined based on 2007 and 2018 ASCO/CAP HER2 breast cancer guidelines.Results.There was a higher rate of HER2 positivity by IHC when using the 2018 guidelines compared to the 2007 guidelines (16.3% vs 12.3%). Concordance between IHC and CISH was 98.9%. ERBB2 amplification was identified by NGS in 10.5% of tumors. Compared to CISH results, this corresponds to a concordance rate of 91.6% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 60.3%. Single gene alterations in HER2 amplified tumors that may implicate HER2 therapy resistance included PI3K (33.1%), KRAS (2.5%), and PTEN (1.3%).Conclusions.There was high concordance between HER2 positivity based on CISH and IHC. Rate of HER2 positivity is the lowest by NGS. Ultimately these testing platforms need to be validated by response to targeted therapy.",0
"AbstractSuperficial cancers typically refer to cancers confined to the surface layers of tissue. Low-targeting therapies or side effects prompt exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), due to their unique optical properties, serve as effective photosensitizers, enabling tumor ablation through photothermal therapy (PTT). PTT induced by AuNPs can be achieved through light sources externally applied to the skin. Near-infrared radiation is the main light candidate due to its deep tissue penetration capability. This review explores recent advancements in AuNP-based PTT for superficial cancers, specifically breast, head and neck, thyroid, bladder and prostate cancers. Additionally, challenges and future directions in utilizing AuNPs for cancer treatment are discussed, emphasizing the importance of balancing efficacy with safety in clinical applications.","Nanotechnology advancements have resulted in many sensors and devices for biomedical applications. Among the various nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), due to their size, shape, biocompatibility, and unique plasmonic property, are an excellent candidate for many biomedical applications. AuNPs, known for their easy surface modifications, robust nature, and photothermal activities, find application in drug delivery and cancer treatment studies. In this review, we are highlighting the recent trends in using AuNPs as nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy not only eliminates the primary tumors but also allows for the treatment of metastasis along with the recurrence of the tumor. AuNPs possess tissue-specific delivery functions that depend on the tunability in size and surface functionalization of AuNPs. AuNPs can be used to activate the tumor’s immune defense ability, or they can be used to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the interaction of the tumor environment and nanobiomedicine is very important. In the present review, we give an idea of the mode of action of AuNPs and various combinations of therapies for cancer immunotherapy.",1
"Metastasis is the ultimate and often lethal stage of cancer. Metastasis occurs in three phases that may vary across individuals: First, dissemination from the primary tumor. Second, tumor dormancy at the metastatic site where micrometastatic cancer cells remain quiescent or, in dynamic cycles of proliferation and elimination, remaining clinically undetectable. Finally, cancer cells are able to overcome microenvironmental constraints for outgrowth, or the formation of clinically detectable macrometastases that colonize distant organs and are largely incurable. A variety of approaches have been used to model metastasis to elucidate molecular mechanisms and identify putative therapeutic targets. In particular, metastatic dormancy has been challenging to model in vivo due to the sparse numbers of cancer cells in micrometastasis nodules and the long latency times required for tumor outgrowth. Here, we review state-of-the art genetically engineered mouse, syngeneic, and patient-derived xenograft approaches for modeling metastasis and dormancy. We describe the advantages and limitations of various metastasis models, novel findings enabled by such approaches, and highlight opportunities for future improvement.","Background:Acute care events (ACEs), comprising ED visits and hospitalizations, are a priority area for reduction in oncology. Prognostic models are a compelling strategy to identify high-risk patients and target preventive services, but have yet to be broadly implemented, partly due to challenges with electronic health record (EHR) integration. To facilitate EHR integration, we adapted and validated the previously published PROACCT model to identify patients at highest risk for ACEs after systemic anti-cancer treatment.Methods:A retrospective cohort of adults with a cancer diagnosis starting systemic therapy at a single center between July and November 2021 was divided into development (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Clinical and demographic variables were extracted, limited to those in structured format in the EHR, including cancer diagnosis, age, drug category, and ACE in prior year. Three logistic regression models of increasing complexity were developed to predict risk of ACEs.Results:5,153 patients were evaluated (3,603 development, 1,550 validation). Several factors were predictive of ACEs: age (in decades), receipt of cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy, thoracic, gastrointestinal or hematologic malignancy, and ACE in the prior year. We defined “high-risk” as the top 10% of risk scores; this population had 33.6% ACE rate compared with 8.3% for the remaining 90% in the low-risk group. The simplest Adapted PROACCT model (A-PROACCT) had a C-statistic of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.28 and specificity of 0.93.Conclusion:We present three models designed for EHR integration that effectively identify oncology patients at highest risk for ACE after initiation of systemic anti-cancer treatment. By limiting predictors to structured data fields and including all cancer types, these models offer broad applicability for cancer care organizations and may offer a “safety-net” to identify and target resources to this high-risk",0
"PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.","BackgroundVasculogenic mimicry (VM), an alternative microvascular circulation independent of angiogenesis, is formed by aggressive cancer cells. Tumor-expressed B7-H3 has been reported to promote VM formation in hepatocellular carcinoma and modulate angiogenesis in breast cancer and colorectal cancer. However, its effects on VM generation and angiogenesis in non-small cell Lung cancer (NSCLC) remained to be elucidated.MethodsCRISPR/Cas9-mediated B7-H3 knockout (KO) was conducted in NSCLC A549 and H3255 cells. The expression of VM-related proteins, including vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), and the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured by western blotting and chemiluminescence assay in both B7-H3 KO and mock-edited A549 and H3255 cells. To examine VM formation, a three-dimensional (3D) culture model was used for B7-H3 KO and mock A549 and H3255 cells. For in vivo analysis, xenograft mice models were established using B7-H3 KO and mock-edited A549 cells, and immunohistochemical (CD31) and histochemical (periodic acid-Schiff, PAS) double staining were performed to identify VM and endothelial vessels in tumor tissues. Finally, specific signaling inhibitors were used to analyze B7-H3-induced signaling pathway responsible for VE-cadherin and MMP14 expression and VM generation.ResultsHigher expression of B7-H3 was associated with a worse prognosis and more advanced T-category in NSCLC. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated B7-H3 KO in A549 and H3255 cells led to decreased expression of VE-cadherin and MMP14; however, the secretion of VEGF by the two cell lines remained unchanged. In the 3D cell culture model, both B7-H3 KO A549 and H3255 cells showed a significant reduction in the formation of capillary-like tubular structures compared to mock-edited cells. In the in vivo xenograft model, mock-edited A549 cells formed excessive PAS+ CD31− VM channels, while B7-H3 KO restrained VM formation in the xenograft tumors. However, no significant differences were found in CD31+ endothelial vessels between xenografts formed by B7-H3 KO and mock-edited A549 cells. Finally, we analyzed the signaling pathway responsible for B7-H3-induced VM formation and found that selective inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) hyperactivation by LY294002 was associated with decreased expression of MMP14 and VE-cadherin, and in vitro VM formation by both A549 and H3255 cells.ConclusionsTumor-expressed B7-H3 acts via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote VM formation by NSCLC cells while bears no effects on angiogenesis in NSCLC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04790-3.",1
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are increasingly used in the treatment of certain cancers but cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Gastrointestinal irAEs may necessitate extended periods of steroid use and the initiation of selective immunosuppressive therapy (SIT) which could theoretically counteract the effect of ICIs. In this study, we aim to explore the impact of immunosuppression use and duration on cancer progression and progression-free survival (PFS).MethodsThis is a single-center retrospective review exploring cancer outcomes in patients taking ICIs who developed gastrointestinal irAEs within 1 year of ICI initiation. Cancer outcome and progression free survival (PFS) were measured and compared by using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.ResultsOf the 116 patients included in this study, 69 received immunosuppression to treat irAEs. The occurrence of colitis and use of immunosuppression for colitis were associated with less cancer progression by later assessment (p < 0.05). Shorter durations of steroids with or without SIT for colitis were associated with less cancer progression within the study window than no immunosuppression (p < 0.05). Immunosuppression has no effect on PFS (p < 0.05).ConclusionOur study reported shorter duration of steroid treatment for colitis may be associated with less cancer progression. Though the use of immunosuppression was not found to impact PFS, this may be confounded by the presence of colitis, which is known to improve cancer outcomes and could mask any negative impact of immunosuppression on survival. It may be preferable to limit long-term immunosuppression in the treatment of immune-mediated colitis to minimize potential complications. Prospective studies are needed to clarify this relationship, and treatments that abrogate the need for immunosuppression in these patients such as fecal microbiota transplantation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04736-9.","Rank aggregation (RA) is the process of consolidating disparate rankings into a single unified ranking. It holds immense potential in the field of genomics. RA has applications in diverse research areas, such as gene expression analysis, meta-analysis, gene prioritization, and biomarker discovery. However, there are many challenges in the application of the RA approach to biological data, such as dealing with heterogeneous data sources, rankings of mixed quality, and evaluating the consolidated rankings. In this review, we present an overview of the existing RA methods with an emphasis on those that have been tailored to the complexities of genomics research. These encompass a broad range of approaches, from distributional and heuristic methods to Bayesian and stochastic optimization algorithms. By examining these techniques, we aim to equip researchers with the background knowledge needed to navigate the intricacies of RA in genomics data integration effectively. We review the practical applications to highlight the relevance and impact of RA methods in advancing genomics research. As the field continues to evolve, we identify open problems and suggest future directions to enhance the effectiveness of rank aggregation in genomics, by addressing the challenges related to data heterogeneity, single-cell omics and spatial transcriptomics data, and the development of clear and consistent evaluation methods. In summary, RA stands as a powerful tool in genomics research, which can offer deeper insights and more comprehensive data integration solutions.",0
"BackgroundColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, which imposes a significant societal burden. Regular screening and emerging molecular tumor markers have important implications for detecting the progression and development of colorectal cancer. Disulfidptosis is a newly defined type of programmed cell death triggered by abnormal accumulation of disulfide compounds in cells that stimulate disulfide stress. Currently, there is no relevant discussion on this mechanism and colorectal cancer.MethodsWe classified the disulfidptosis-related subtypes of colorectal cancer using bioinformatics methods. Through secondary clustering of differentially expressed genes between subtypes, we identified characteristic genes of the disulfidptosis subtype, constructed a prognostic model, and searched for potential biomarkers through clinical validation.ResultsUsing disulfidptosis-related genes collected from the literature, we classified colorectal cancer patients from public databases into three subtypes. The differentially expressed genes between subtypes were clustered into three gene subtypes, and eight characteristic genes were screened to construct a prognostic model.ConclusionThe disulfidptosis mechanism has important value in the classification of colorectal cancer patients, and characteristic genes selected based on this mechanism can serve as a new potential biological marker for colorectal cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05211-1.","In recent years, as more and more lung-cancer patients have been treated with immunotherapeutic agents, their survival has been prolonged compared to before. It is well known that BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase) is predominantly found in cells of the hematopoietic system. However, there is a distinct lack of literature on BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and its effect on the immune microenvironment. Consequently, the main goal of this investigation was to analyze how BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma affects its progression, along with its prognostic significance, through the utilization of bioinformatics online resources and publicly available databases. Data on the sequencing results and clinical records of lung adenocarcinoma patients were gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the expression level of BKT, TCGA categorized lung adenocarcinoma patients into BTK high-expression and low-expression groups. We investigated the effects of BKT on clinicopathologic, genomic, and immunologic characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma patients. We analyzed BTK mRNA expression in tumors and normal tissues using two key resources: Tumor Immuno Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER 2.0) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA 2). We analyzed the prognosis of the patients using GEPIA2 and validated the results using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, we assessed BTK protein expression by Human Protein Atlas (HPA). We sought to elucidate the clinical prognostic significance of BTK in The TCGA using the online tool GEPIA 2. Furthermore, to clarify the biologic roles and pathways linked to BTK, we conducted a genomic enrichment analysis of the information. To predict the proportion of various immune cell infiltrations in the immune microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed in the TCGA database, we performed an analysis using the TIMER online tool. Using TIMER and CIBERSORT, the correlation between genes co-expressed with BTK and the corresponding tumor-infiltrating immune cells was explored; finally, the relationship between BTK expression and immune infiltration and immune checkpoints in the TMB group and the high and low groups was analyzed by R language analysis using the TCGA database. The expression of BTK provides some hints about the prognosis of the patients. The high expression of BTK is involved in immune response regulation signaling pathways, leukocyte-mediated immunity, leukocyte intercellular adhesion, graft rejection, and complement. Analysis of the GEPIA 2 database showed that BTK was co-expressed with the genes FGD2, SASH3, NCKAP1L, CD53, ARHGAP30 and LPXN. Increased expression of the above-mentioned genes resulted in increased proportions of CD8 + T cells, memory CD4 + T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and decreased proportions of Treg cells and TH2 cells. In addition, our study revealed a strong positive correlation between various key immune checkpoints (for example, PDCD1, CD274, PDCD1LG2, CTLA4, HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and SIGLEC15) and BTK expression. In conclusion, increased BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma is closely associated with prolonged survival of lung-cancer patients. Moreover, the genes classified under the BTK high-expression group exhibit significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, suggesting a potential impact on the tumor microenvironment. We investigated the potential of BTK as a tumor suppressor gene in predicting prolonged patient survival. In addition, we further investigated the possibility that BTK further affects the immunotherapeutic response of patients by influencing the microenvironment of tumor immune infiltration, but the relevant mechanisms remain to be further studied.",1
"PurposeThe expression of cytochrome B561 (CYB561) and its role in breast cancer (BC) prognosis remain unclear. We analyzed the differential expression and prognostic value of CYB561 using online databases and a clinical cohort through bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry.MethodsThe differential expression of CYB561 and its association with BC were analyzed using the tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER), gene expression profiling interaction analysis2 (GEPIA2), Human Protein Atlas, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and Kaplan–Meier Plotter website. Important pathways of CYB561 enrichment were explored using gene set enrichment analysis. Immunohistochemistry detected CYB561 expression in normal breast, breast hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), para-cancer, and invasive BC groups. Association between CYB561 expression and BC prognosis was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses.ResultsCYB561 mRNA expression was higher in GEPIA and TIMER BC patients than in para-cancer tissues. CYB561 was expressed in the glandular epithelium and myoepithelium, with positive localization in the cytoplasm and cell membrane. CYB561 protein expression significantly differed among the groups. CYB561 expression was correlated with ERBB2/HER2 and infiltrating CD4+ T cells in GEPIA and TIMER BC patients and associated with HER2 status, histological grade, and molecular subtypes in the clinical cohort but not related to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. CYB561 mRNA overexpression predicted reduced recurrence-free survival and overall survival in BC. Patients with CYB561 expression had significantly reduced overall survival and increased risk of death.ConclusionCYB561 can serve as an effective clinical prognostic biomarker for BC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03928-z.","PurposeWe aimed to study the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) using bioinformatics.MethodsGSE39582 and GSE39084, which collectively contain 363 CRC samples, were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database as a test set. TCGA-COADREAD, with 376 CRC samples, was downloaded from the UCSC database as a validation set. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for ARGs that were significantly associated with prognosis. The top 10 ARGs were used to classify the samples into different subtypes based on unsupervised cluster analysis. The immune environments of the different subtypes were analyzed. ARGs that were significantly associated with CRC prognosis were used to construct a risk model. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen independent prognostic factors and construct a nomogram.ResultsFour anoikis-related subtypes (ARSs) with differential prognoses and immune microenvironments were identified. KRAS and epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathways were enriched in subtype B, which had the worst prognosis. Three ARGs (DLG1, AKT3, and LPAR1) were used to construct the risk model. Both the test and validation sets showed worse outcomes for patients in the high-risk group than those in the low-risk group. Risk score was found to be an independent prognostic factor for CRC. Moreover, there was a difference in drug sensitivity between the high- and low-risk groups.ConclusionThe identified ARGs and risk scores were associated with CRC prognosis and could predict the responses of patients with CRC to immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04945-2.",0

Meanwhile, M2 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) plays an important role in tumor progression. Here, we propose to combine these two perspectives to detect novel disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related biomarkers in bladder cancer (BCa) to identify various tumor subtypes, construct prognostic features, reveal immune and somatic mutational landscapes, and screen for drugs in BCa.MethodsWe used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to mine M2 TAM-related genes. Consensus unsupervised clustering was performed to identify potential tumor subtypes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to build the risk model. We then explored the immune cell, immune function, immune checkpoint expression patterns and somatic mutational landscape in clusters and risk groups. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis for anti-cancer drugs.ResultsWe identified 3057 M2 TAM-related genes and intersected them with disulfidptosis-related genes to obtain 95 disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related genes (DMRGs). In terms of tumor subtypes, two molecular clusters were identified. Cluster 1 showed stronger immunogenicity and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). We also predicted 50 drugs with high sensitivity in cluster 1. On the basis of risk grouping, the high-risk group had poor overall survival in the training, test, and validation groups. Ten screened anti-cancer drugs were more sensitive in the high-risk group. A nomogram predicting survival of BCa patients was also established.ConclusionBy combining two hotspot perspectives, disulfidptosis and M2 TAM, we provide a valuable risk score signature for establishing individualized treatment regimens and drug choices. The risk score may serve as an independent risk factor for BCa patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05352-3.",1
"Introduction:In 2018, durvalumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as consolidation immunotherapy for patients with stage III NSCLC after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, whether durvalumab benefits patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC remains unknown.Methods:We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC who completed concurrent CRT. Kaplan-Meier analyses evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who completed CRT with or without durvalumab.Results:Among 37 patients, 13 initiated durvalumab a median of 20 days after CRT completion. Two patients completed 12 months of treatment, with five patients discontinuing durvalumab owing to progression and five owing to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Of 24 patients who completed CRT without durvalumab, 16 completed CRT alone and eight completed CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Median PFS was 10.3 months in patients who received CRT and durvalumab versus 6.9 months with CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.993). CRT and EGFR TKI was associated with a significantly longer median PFS (26.1 mo) compared with CRT and durvalumab or CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.023). Six patients treated with durvalumab initiated EGFR TKIs after recurrence, with one developing grade 4 pneumonitis on osimertinib.Conclusions:In this study, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC did not benefit with consolidation durvalumab and experienced a high frequency of irAEs. Patients who initiate osimertinib after durvalumab may be susceptible to incident irAEs. Consolidation durvalumab should be approached with caution in this setting and concurrent CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR TKIs further investigated as definitive treatment.","BackgroundThe survival benefit of first-line epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in super-elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring active EGFR mutations remains unclear.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective evaluation of the difference in the overall survival (OS) among super-elderly (aged ≥ 85 years) NSCLC patients who had received best supportive care alone (BSC group, n = 36), cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT group, n = 11) or EGFR-TKI therapy (TKI group, n = 22).ResultsThe median age of the patients was 88 years. Among the 35 super-elderly NSCLC patients with an performance status (PS) score of 0–2, 11of 18 EGFR wild-type patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy and 15 of 17 EGFR-mutant patients received EGFR-TKI therapy with gefitinib (n = 13) or osimertinib (n = 2). The OS tended to be longer in the TKI group than in the CT or BSC group (16.9 months vs. 7.2 months or 9.8 months, p = 0.059). Among the 34 super-elderly NSCLC patients with a PS score of 3–4, 7 with EGFR-mutant received gefitinib therapy and the remaining 27 received BSC alone. The OS tended to be longer in the TKI group than in the BSC group (4.6 months vs. 2.3 months, p = 0.060). Multivariate analysis identified a good PS before the start of first-line therapy and presence of active EGFR mutations reduced a risk of death.ConclusionsGefitinib appears to be useful as a salvage therapy in super-elderly NSCLC patients with active EGFR mutation, regardless of their PS.",1
"Drug resistance and toxicity are major challenges observed during cancer treatment. In recent years, gut microbiota has been found to be strongly associated with the efficacy, toxicity, and side effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Both preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of microbiota modulation for cancer treatment. The human gut microbiota has exciting prospects for developing biomarkers to predict the outcome of cancer treatment. Moreover, multiple approaches can alter the gut microbiota composition, including faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, antibiotics (ATB), and diet. We describe the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influences the efficacy and toxicity of cancer therapy, disease-related biomarkers, and methods to target the gut microbiota to improve outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide new ideas for optimising cancer therapy by providing up-to-date information on the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer therapy, and hopes to find new targets for cancer treatment from human microbiota.","Background:In this study, we compare outcomes of older patients with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (PCNSL) undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) with either thiotepa/carmustine (BCNU/Thio) or thiotepa/busulfan/cyclophosphamide (TBC) conditioning.Methods:We used a post-publication dataset made available by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Research (CIBMTR) including patients who were ≥65 years in age with PCNSL and underwent autoHCT as consolidation with TBC or BCNU/Thio conditioning.Results:Out of 147 patients; n=84 received BCNU/Thio and n=63 received TBC. The 1-year NRM in the BCNU/Thio group was 10% versus 22% in the TBC group (p=0.05) and the 2-year relapse rate was 5% versus 5%, respectively (p=1.00). The 2-year PFS in the BCNU/Thio group was 85% versus 71% in the TBC group (p=0.05) and 2-year OS was 86% vs 74% (p=0.08). In a multivariable regression model, BCNU/Thio was associated with a lower risk for NRM [Hazard Ratio (HR), 0.33, p=0.009], improved PFS (HR, 0.41, p=0.008) and OS (HR, 0.37, p=0.007), but there was no association with relapse risk.Conclusion:We found that in older adults with PCNSL undergoing consolidation with autoHCT, BCNU/Thio conditioning is associated with lower NRM and improved OS compared to TBC.",0
"BackgroundThe immunostimulatory actions of innate and adaptive immune responses play a crucial role in the cancer-immunity cycle. Although cervical cancer (CC) exhibits a high recurrence rate, the relation with lymphocytes in the tumor tissue have not been analyzed.MethodsWe analyzed NKT, NK, and T cells, not only in peripheral blood (PB), but also tumor tissue through histological analysis from 23 patients with CC collected before treatment. A correlation of them between PB and the tumor tissue were assessed.ResultsWe detected functional NKT and NKG2Dhi NK cells and effector CD4+ Tregs in PB. In the tumor, we detected the infiltration of LAG-3+ TIM-3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells rather than NK cells particularly in the invasion front (IF) by fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry. The heatmap and correlation analysis revealed that LAG-3+ TIM-3+ CD8+ T cells are highly associated with CD69+ CD103− exhausted CD8+ T cells. We identified the statistical relationship between CD4+Tregs in PB and the number of LAG-3+ TIM-3+ CD4+ T cells in the IF, which may be related to recurrence in patients with CC.ConclusionsLAG-3+ TIM-3+ T cells located in the IF may play a key role in regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment.","AbstractPurposeHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is a critical biomarker in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). While the role of HER2-positive tumors in guiding targeted therapies is well-established, the clinical implications of HER2-low expression, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization-negative (ISH-negative), remain undetermined. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance and clinicopathological features of HER2-low AGC.Patients and methodsThis retrospective analysis involved patients with AGC treated with first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy from 2011 to 2020. Patients were categorized into HER2-zero (HER2 IHC 0), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-negative), and HER2-positive (IHC 2+/ISH-positive or 3+) groups.ResultsAmong 548 patients analyzed, 33.0%, 45.1%, and 21.8% were classified as HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive, respectively. The proportions of male patients, intestinal-type histology, esophagogastric junction/cardia involvement, metastatic disease status, ≥2 metastatic sites, liver metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and high serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels were gradually elevated in the HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive groups. Overall survival (median) was 13.8, 13.6, and 23.0 months, respectively, with a non-significant trend favoring HER2-positive over HER2-low (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.80; P = .0672). A delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival between the HER2-zero and HER2-low groups was observed, without reaching statistical significance (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.12; P = .2568).ConclusionPatients with HER2-low status exhibited intermediate and specific clinicopathological features within the HER2-negative category. In terms of prognosis, HER2-low patients showed a worsening trend compared with HER2-positive patients. This evidence implies that HER2-low status represents a distinct clinical subset, bridging the gap between the HER2-zero and HER2-positive profiles.",0
"PurposeChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has demonstrated clinical success in treating haematologic malignancies but has not been effective against solid tumours thus far. Trop2 is a tumour-related antigen broadly overexpressed on a variety of tumours and has been reported as a promising target for pancreatic cancers. Our study aimed to determine whether CAR T cells designed with a fully human Trop2-specific single-chain fragment variable (scFv) can be used in the treatment of Trop2-positive pancreatic tumours.MethodsWe designed Trop2-targeted chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells with a novel human anti-Trop2 scFv (2F11) and then investigated the cytotoxicity, degranulation, and cytokine secretion profiles of the anti-Trop2 CAR T cells when they were exposed to Trop2 + cancer cells in vitro. We also studied the antitumour efficacy and toxicity of Trop2-specific CAR T cells in vivo using a BxPC-3 pancreatic xenograft model.ResultsTrop2-targeted CAR T cells designed with 2F11 effectively killed Trop2-positive pancreatic cancer cells and produced high levels of cytotoxic cytokines in vitro. In addition, Trop2-targeted CAR T cells, which persistently circulate in vivo and efficiently infiltrate into tumour tissues, significantly blocked and even eliminated BxPC-3 pancreatic xenograft tumour growth without obvious deleterious effects observed after intravenous injection into NSG mice. Moreover, disease-free survival was efficiently prolonged.ConclusionThese results show that Trop2-targeted CAR T cells equipped with a fully human anti-Trop2 scFv could be a potential treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer and could be useful for clinical evaluation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04017-x.","BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare solid malignancy with a poor prognosis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in tumorigenesis and progression. However, little is known about the role of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC.Methodsm6A-related lncRNAs were extracted by Pearson analysis, and then prognosis-related lncRNAs were filtered from the m6A-related lncRNAs by univariate Cox regression analysis. Based on the expression patterns of the prognosis-related lncRNAs, samples were classified into distinct clusters. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used to construct a m6A-lncRNA-related prognostic signature for PC patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate the prognostic ability of the model.ResultsA total of 178 tumor and 4 normal samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database in our study. Based on the expression of 12 filtered prognosis-related lncRNAs, two distinct clusters were eventually identified; these clusters were characterized by differences in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and prognosis. A risk model comprising ten m6A-related lncRNAs was identified as an independent predictor of prognosis. ROC analysis revealed that this model had an acceptable prognostic value for PC patients. The prognostic signature was related to the TIME and the expression of critical immune checkpoint molecules.ConclusionThis study comprehensively assessed the expression pattern and prognostic value of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC. The different clusters correlated with distinct TIMEs and prognoses. The study also constructed a ten-gene signature prognostic model based on m6A-related lncRNAs, which showed good accuracy in predicting overall survival.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03985-4.",1
"The association of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) with melanoma has been well documented. Similarly, the outcome of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) in melanoma depends, to some extent, on the HLA genotype of the patient. Although specific favorable (or unfavorable) HLA alleles for CBI outcome for melanoma have been identified, there is currently no reliable way to predict a positive, neutral or negative melanoma CBI outcome for other alleles. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to identify HLA alleles whose frequency is negatively (or positively) associated with melanoma prevalence (protective or susceptibility alleles, respectively). The findings demonstrated that, indeed, HLA alleles that are negatively associated with melanoma prevalence in the population have been associated with good CBI outcome at the individual level and, conversely, HLA alleles that are positively associated with melanoma prevalence have been associated with poor CBI outcome in individuals. Given this good prediction of CBI cancer immunotherapy by specific immunogenetically discovered HLA alleles, we used this epidemiologic immunogenetic approach to identify more HLA Class I and II alleles protective (or susceptibility) for melanoma which would thus be good predictors of CBI outcomes in those cancers. This is a new approach to successfully (a) identify HLA protective or susceptibility alleles for melanoma, and (b) use that information in anticipating outcomes in CBI cancer immunotherapy.","The emerging field of cancer neuroscience reshapes our understanding of the intricate relationship between the nervous system and cancer biology; this new paradigm is likely to fundamentally change and advance neuro-oncological care. The profound interplay between cancers and the nervous system is reciprocal: Cancer growth can be induced and regulated by the nervous system; conversely, tumors can themselves alter the nervous system. Such crosstalk between cancer cells and the nervous system is evident in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Recent advances have uncovered numerous direct neuron-cancer interactions at glioma-neuronal synapses, paracrine mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment, and indirect neuroimmune interactions. Neurosurgeons have historically played a central role in neuro-oncological care, and as the field of cancer neuroscience is becoming increasingly established, the role of neurosurgical intervention is becoming clearer. Examples include peripheral denervation procedures, delineation of neuron-glioma networks, development of neuroprostheses, neuromodulatory procedures, and advanced local delivery systems. The present review seeks to highlight key cancer neuroscience mechanisms with neurosurgical implications and outline the future role of neurosurgical intervention in cancer neuroscience.",0
"PurposeTherapies targeting the immune checkpoint molecules programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) have been explored in various malignant tumours. In this study, we examined the relationship between PDL-1, IDO1 and JAK2 expression and the roles of these signal pathways in soft tissue leiomyosarcoma (LMS).MethodsThe next-generation sequencing data of 53 patients with LMS were obtained from an online public database and were used to assess PD-L1, IDO1 and JAK2 gene amplification and mRNA expression. Then, we determined the relationship between JAK–STAT pathway activation and PD-L1 and IDO1 expression in a LMS cell line. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of 69 cases of LMS was performed for PD-L1, IDO1, TDO2 and phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2).ResultsComprehensive gene expression analysis using microarray and RNA-Seq data revealed that PD-L1 and IDO1 mRNA expression positively correlated with JAK2 and STAT1 mRNA expression. Two of the 53 cases exhibited PD-L1 and JAK2 gene amplification; however, they were not related to their gene expression. LMS cell line analysis revealed that IFN-γ supplementation induced IDO1 and PD-L1 expression; these effects were suppressed by JAK inhibition. Immunohistochemical analysis of the resected specimens revealed that TDO2 expression positively correlated with pJAK2 (P = 0.0490) and IDO1 expression (P < 0.0001). PD-L1-positive specimens tended to express pJAK2; however, the relationship did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.1477).ConclusionThe results suggest the possible feasibility of the combined inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 or IDO1 with IFN-γ–JAK–STAT pathway inhibition to treat soft tissue LMS.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03390-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Senescent cells can either to promote immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment or facilitate immune surveillance.

Various techniques were employed to determine their physiochemical characteristics. MTT assay, cell apoptosis analysis and combination index analysis were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic feasibility of Nio-AuNPs combined with XRT.Results: The combination of Nio-AuNPs and XRT resulted in greater cytotoxicity compared with XRT alone or with AuNPs.Conclusion: The AuNPs-loaded niosomal formulation enhances the efficacy of XRT on lung cancer cells in vitro, presenting a promising and effective therapeutic strategy.","BACKGROUNDLittle is known about the impact of residential segregation on early detection, treatment, and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a predominant type of lung cancers.RESEARCH QUESTIONDoes racialized economic segregation play a role in NSCLC treatment and outcomes and contribute to racial disparities?STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSThis study included non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients with NSCLC diagnosed between 2007 and 2015 and identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset. County-level racialized economic segregation was estimated using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE). Multilevel logistic regression and multilevel Cox regression accounting for county-level clustering were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for late-stage diagnosis and treatment underutilization, and hazard ratio (HR) for mortality.RESULTSOf 203,441 patients, 85.8% were NHW and 14.2% were NHB. Compared with patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of high-income NHW households (lowest ICE quintile), patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of low-income NHB households (highest ICE quintile) had higher risks of late-stage diagnosis (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.02–1.16; Ptrend <.001), underutilization of guideline-recommended treatment (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.16–1.41; Ptrend <.0001), lung cancer-specific mortality (HR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.07–1.14; Ptrend <.0001), and overall mortality (HR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.09–1.16; Ptrend <.0001). The association between segregation and treatment underutilization was stronger in NHW than NHB patients (Pinteraction =0.02). There was no significant difference in the segregation-related risk of late-stage diagnosis, lung cancer-specific mortality, or overall mortality between NHW and NHB patients.INTERPRETATIONLiving in segregated, low-income NHB counties had adverse impacts on early detection, treatment, and outcomes of NSCLC. However, residential segregation did not explain the excess risks of NSCLC care underutilization and mortality in NHB patients compared with NHW patients.",1
"Inflammation and a dysregulated immune system are common denominators in cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) highlighted the convergence of interleukin (IL)-1β biology in cancer and CVD, and the potential of anti–IL-1β drugs for the treatment of both disease entities. Accumulating evidence further supports the role of the innate immunity members and IL-1β activators, S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in both cancer and CVD. This review outlines the common involvement of S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in cancer and CVD. Specifically, their time-, cell-, and context-dependent actions and hereto-related dichotomous role in different cancers and CVD are addressed, highlighting the need for further insights to allow tailored therapies.","IntroductionNanotechnology has shown potential in treating different types of cancers. In particular, nano-drug delivery systems (DDSs) offer a promising strategy for treating oral cancer. By customizing therapy and improving drug delivery, these systems can improve outcomes for patients. Hence, a review was conducted to assess the current evidence and explore the use of DDSs for treating oral cancer.AimTo comprehensively explore the nano-drug carriers and target delivery for oral cancer therapy and to discuss the benefits, challenges, and potential to guide future research and clinical practice.MethodologyA systematic search of articles archived in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane using keywords such as Nano, drug carrier, target drug delivery, and oral cancer was performed to fulfill the objectives from inception till February 2, 2024. Articles providing insights into nano-drug carriers in oral cancer were included.ResultsThe results revealed a total of 156 articles. After duplicate removal, 136 articles were screened for title and abstract as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 113 articles were excluded with reasons. Out of the remaining 23 articles, only 11 were included for qualitative data synthesis.ConclusionThe literature revealed scarcity of oral cancer-related work using DDSs.

It is alternatively referred to as mSWI/SNF and has been suggested to be imbalanced in human disease compared with human health. Three types of BAF assemblies associated with it have been described, including  canonical BAF (cBAF),  polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), and  non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complexes. Each of these BAF assemblies plays a role, either functional or dysfunctional, in governing gene expression patterns, cellular processes, epigenetic mechanisms, and biological processes. Recent evidence increasingly links the dysregulation of mSWI/SNF complexes to various human non-malignant lung chronic disorders and lung malignant diseases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive general state-of-the-art and a profound examination of the current understanding of mSWI/SNF assembly processes, as well as the structural and functional organization of mSWI/SNF complexes and their subunits. In addition, it explores their intricate functional connections with potentially dysregulated transcription factors, placing particular emphasis on molecular and cellular pathogenic processes in lung diseases. These processes are reflected in human epigenome aberrations that impact clinical and therapeutic levels, suggesting novel perspectives on the diagnosis and molecular therapies for human respiratory diseases.",1
"Nanozymes are a unique class of nanomaterials that possess intrinsic enzymatic properties, exhibiting similar reaction kinetics to natural enzymes. As enzyme substitutes in various biomedical applications, nanozymes offer numerous advantages, including low cost, tunable catalytic activity, and exceptional stability. However, their catalytic activities are typically lower than those of natural enzymes, and the lack of precise control over their functional modulation limits their therapeutic potential. To address these challenges, the biomimetic and intelligent design of nanozymes has been introduced as a critical concept for enhancing their functionality. In this review, we will explore the importance of biomimetic design in the development of intelligent nanozymes. We will first introduce the foundational principles and strategies for their targeted design, followed by an overview of recent advances in the regulatory mechanisms and biomedical applications of intelligent nanozymes. Lastly, we will highlight the current limitations in this research field and propose future directions. With continued progress in biomimetic and intelligent design, nanozymes are poised to accelerate their clinical translation and large-scale commercialization, further expanding their potential in therapeutic applications.","ABSTRACTObjectivesTo evaluate the effects of CALM intervention on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), and heart rate variability (HRV) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.MethodsA total of 153 NSCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to the CALM group and usual care (UC) group. Patients in the CALM group were received 6 CALM intervention sessions over a 12-week period and evaluated using CRF, QOL and HRV at baseline (T0) and after 2, 4, and 6 intervention sessions.ResultsThe CALM group showed significant differences in total CRF, behavioral/daily life CRF, emotional/affective CRF, sensory/physical CRF, cognitive CRF and QOL before and after CALM intervention sessions (F = 643.47, F = 208.34, F = 354.52, F = 285.69, F = 334.29, F = 245.77, p < 0.001). The CALM group showed significant increases in standard deviation of normal R-R interval (SDNN) and high-frequency power (HF) (z = −4.94, p < 0.001,z = −4.30, p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were observed between CRF and SDNN, HF and QOL across all participants.ConclusionsThe CALM intervention had a positive impact on overall physical and mental health, fatigue reduction, quality of life and autonomic dysfunction in NSCLC patients.

"BackgroundB7-H3 is a cell surface immunomodulatory glycoprotein overexpressed in prostate cancers (PC). Understanding its longitudinal expression at emergence of castration-resistance, and association with tumour genomics, is critical to the development of and patient selection for B7-H3 targeted therapies.ObjectiveTo characterize B7-H3 expression in same-patient, castration-sensitive PC (CSPC) and castration-resistant PC (CRPC) biopsies, associating this with PC genomics, and to evaluate the antitumour activity of an anti-B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in human CRPC in vitro and in vivo.Design, setting, and participantsWe performed IHC and next generation sequencing on a cohort of 98 clinically annotated, CRPC biopsies, among which 72 patients had CSPC biopsies for analyses. We analysed two CRPC transcriptome and exome datasets. PC organoids (PDX-Os) were derived from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generated from human CRPC biopsies.Outcome measurementsWe evaluated B7-H3 mRNA expression in relation to a panel of 770 immune-related genes; compared B7-H3 protein expression between same-patient CSPC and CRPC biopsies; determined associations with PC genomic alterations; evaluated the antitumour activity of DS-7300a, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor payload anti-B7-H3 ADC, in human PC cell lines, organoids and xenografts of different histologies, B7-H3 expressions, and genomics.Results and limitationsB7-H3 was one of the most highly expressed immunomodulatory genes in CRPCs. Most CSPCs (97%) and CRPCs (93%) expressed B7-H3 and conversion from B7-H3 positive to negative, or vice versa, during progression from CSPC to CRPC was rare. B7-H3 is overexpressed in tumours with defective DNA repair (DDR) gene (ATM, BRCA1/2) alterations compared to tumours without DDR gene alteration. DS7300a had antitumour activity against B7-H3 expressing human PC models including cell lines, PDX-Os and PDXs of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine histology.ConclusionsB7-H3 is overexpressed in the majority of PCs, especially DDR defective tumours. B7-H3 positive CRPC may be targeted with an anti-B7-H3 ADC.Patient summaryB7-H3, a protein expressed on the surface of most lethal PC, and in particular those with specific mutations, can be targeted using drugs that bind B7-H3 and carry potent chemotherapies. These drugs are being evaluated in cancer patients.","PurposeEarly biochemical recurrence (eBCR) indicated a high risk for potential recurrence and metastasis in prostate cancer. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification played an important role in prostate cancer progression. This study aimed to develop a m6A lncRNA signature to accurately predict eBCR in prostate cancer.MethodsPearson correlation analysis was first conducted to explore m6A lncRNAs and univariate Cox regression analysis was further performed to identify m6A lncRNAs of prognostic roles for predicting eBCR in prostate cancer. The m6A lncRNA signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis (LASSO) in training cohort and further validated in test cohort. Furthermore, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were utilized to explore potential effective drugs for high-risk group in this study.ResultsFive hundred and thirty-eighth m6A lncRNAs were searched out through Pearson correlation analysis and 25 out of 538 m6A lncRNAs were identified to pose prediction roles for eBCR in prostate cancers. An m6A lncRNA signature including 5 lncRNAs was successfully built in training cohort. The high-risk group derived from m6A lncRNA signature could efficiently predict eBCR occurrence in both training (p < 0.001) and test cohort (p = 0.002). ROC analysis also confirmed that lncRNA signature in this study posed more accurate prediction roles for eBCR occurrence when compared with PSA, TNM stages and Gleason scores. Drug sensitivity analysis further discovered that various drugs could be potentially utilized to treat high-risk samples in this study. ConclusionsThe m6A lncRNA signature in this study could be utilized to efficiently predict eBCR occurrence, various clinical characteristic and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04040-y.",1
"ObjectiveCellular cannibalism (CC) is a prime metabolic event to determine the aggressive potential of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the etiology and mechanism behind this degradation are still ambiguous. The aim of the study was to explore the etiopathogenetic mechanism behind CC, along with its association with degree of differentiation, angiogenic, phagocytic and antiapoptotic activity in OSCC.DesignSeventy-three tissue sections of various histological grades of OSCC were retrieved from departmental archives and scanned for cannibalistic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using CD31, CD68, and BCL2 was performed. The data obtained were analyzed using Chi-square, Spearman’s correlation test and multiple regression analysis (p < 0.05).ResultsCCs were present significantly in various grades of OSCC (p < 0.00). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant difference in CD68, BCL2 (p < 0.05 in both), and CD31 (p < 0.001) expression with CC. The internalized cells showed positivity for CD68 and negativity for BCL2. Regression analysis revealed that tumor grade, CD31 and BCL2 immunoreactivity were significant predictors of frequency of CC.ConclusionThe association of CC with degree of differentiation, CD31, CD68, and BCL2 expression could predict the biological behavior of OSCC and might serve as a promising histopathological parameter in future.","AbstractBackgroundCannabis use is prevalent among cancer patients and survivors and may provide some therapeutic benefits for this population. However, benefits may be attenuated when cannabis is co-used with tobacco, which is associated with more severe tobacco and cannabis use and adverse outcomes in noncancer populations. We compared cannabis use, primary mode of use, and therapeutic and/or nontherapeutic use among 3 groups of patients and survivors based on cigarette smoking status.MethodsSurvey data was collected from patients and survivors with cancer (n = 1732) at 2 US National Cancer Institute–designated cancer centers in states with varying cannabis regulatory policy. Prevalence of cannabis use (prior to diagnosis, after diagnosis, before treatment, after treatment), primary mode of use, and therapeutic and/or nontherapeutic use were assessed by cigarette smoking status (current, former, never) within and across centers using weighted bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression, controlling for demographic and clinical variables.ResultsCurrent cigarette use was associated with greater rates of cannabis use prior to diagnosis, after diagnosis, during treatment, and after treatment within each center (all P < .001) and in pooled analyses across centers (all P < .001). Primary mode of use, knowledge of cannabis products, and therapeutic and/or nontherapeutic use also statistically differed by tobacco status and study site.ConclusionsResults illustrate the importance of conducting assessments for both tobacco and cannabis use among cancer patients during and after cancer treatment, regardless of the cannabis regulatory environment. Given previous data indicating harms from co-use and continued tobacco use during cancer treatment, this issue introduces new priorities for cancer care delivery and research.",0
"PurposeTo compare brachytherapy to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with respect to overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) among NSCLC patients undergoing limited surgical resection.MethodsAll cases of T1-4 N0 M0 NSCLC undergoing limited resection and either brachytherapy or EBRT diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact analysis were used to analyze categorical variables while Student’s t-test was used to analyze continuous variables. Univariate analysis to assess for differences in survival with respect to covariates was performed with the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis was performed with Cox proportional hazards regression models among the entire cohort and after sub-stratification by T stage.ResultsAmong 543 patients, 471 underwent EBRT and 72 underwent brachytherapy. Brachytherapy demonstrated improved OS and DSS on univariate analysis as compared to EBRT (p < 0.05). Cox regression also demonstrated improved OS and DSS with brachytherapy (HR 0.604; 95% CI [0.380; 0.961] and HR 0.524; 95% CI [0.303; 0.908], respectively). Sub-cohort analysis demonstrated significant improvement in survival only among patients with T1 disease with similar survival between brachytherapy and EBRT among higher stage disease.ConclusionsPatients undergoing brachytherapy for T1-T4, N0, M0 NSCLC demonstrated at least similar survival as compared to those undergoing EBRT among patients undergoing limited resection. Improved survival was demonstrated among patients with T1 disease.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03375-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeThis study aimed to explore the value of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) and develop nomograms to predict the prognosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients with receiving radiology therapy or/and chemotherapy (RT/&CT).MethodsClinical data of patients with mRCC between 2010 and 2015 were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Prognostic nomograms were constructed to predict the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) probability for 1-, 3-, and 5- years in patients with mRCC. A series of validation methods were used to validate the accuracy and reliability of the model, including area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), consistency index (C-index), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).Results1394 patients were enrolled in this study. All patients were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 976) and the validation cohort (n = 418). In the training cohort, multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that pathology grade, histology type, T stage, N stage, surgery, and distant metastasis were independent risk factors for OS and CSS. The AUC and C-index were both over 0.65 in both cohorts, indicating that the nomograms for OS and CSS had satisfactory discriminative power. The calibration curves revealed that the predictive nomograms had a good consistency between the observed and the predicted survival.ConclusionThis study provided evidence that mRCC patients underwent RT/&CT could gain survival benefits from CN. The prognostic nomogram constructed in our study is reliable and practical, may help guide clinical strategies in the treatment of mRCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04885-x.",1
"BackgroundTumor vaccines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an area of intense interest. Tremendous clinical trials have been conducted globally, but the efficacy and security of tumor vaccines are elusive. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and security of tumor vaccines.MethodsAll relevant studies were identified in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science and Cochrane Library databases. Objective response rate (ORR), median overall survival (OS), or median progression-free survival (PFS) and 95% CI were meta-analyzed based on the random-effects model. The individual-level data of OS, PFS were pooled by conducting survival analysis. All observed adverse events were collected.Results31 studies containing 35 eligible cohorts with 932 HCC patients were included. The pooled ORR were 7% (95% CI 3–14%), while ORR of dendritic cell (DC) vaccine (19%, 95% CI 11–29%) were highly significant than ORR of peptide vaccine (1%, 95% CI 0–5%). The pooled median OS and PFS were 13.67 months (95% CI 8.20–22.80) and 6.19 months (95% CI 2.97–12.91), respectively. The pooled median OS (DC vaccine: median OS = 21.77 months, 95% CI 18.33–25.86; Peptide vaccine: median OS = 10.08 months, 95% CI 5.23–19.44) and PFS (DC vaccine: median PFS = 11.01 months, 95% CI 5.25–23.09; Peptide vaccine: median PFS = 1.97 months, 95% CI 1.53–2.54) of DC vaccine were also longer than that of peptide vaccine. HBV-related HCC may acquire more benefits from tumor vaccines than HCV-related HCC. In almost all studies, the observed toxicities were moderate even tiny.ConclusionsTumor vaccines for HCC, especially DC vaccine, are safe and worth exploring. More high-quality prospective studies are warranted.","ObjectiveImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been validated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, there exists no evidence regarding NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, experiencing EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment failure. We collected clinical information from real world and conducted a time series-based meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations and experienced EGFR-TKIs resistance.MethodsTwenty-two NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations after TKI resistance were included from two hospitals. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literature published until December 31, 2021. Endpoint outcomes included mortality and progression-free survival (PFS) at different times of follow-up.ResultsIn total, 22 patients showed that the median PFS was 5.6 months (range 2.0–9.0 months). According to treatment strategies, the median PFS was 2.4 months (range 2.0–5.3 months) in the ICI monotherapy group and 5.9 months (range 2.8–9.0 months) in the ICI combined Chemotherapy group. Additionally, sixteen studies, including 5 trials, 10 controlled cohorts and 1 real-world study, were assessed, involving a total of ICI-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation after TKI failure. The 6-month survival and PFS rate were 0.82 (95% CI 0.36–0.97) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.34–0.74), respectively. ICI combined chemotherapy showed the best survival outcome among these groups, as demonstrated by the 12-month survival rate and PFS. No new safety signals were identified with the combination therapy. The frequency of treatment-related adverse events was similar to that in previously reported studies of chemotherapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors.ConclusionsThe addition of ICIs plus chemotherapy may significantly improve progression-free survival among patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who EGFR-TKIs resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04176-x.",1
"ABSTRACTHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer-related death with limited therapies, is a complex disease developing in a background of Hepatitis Virus infection or systemic conditions, such as the metabolic syndrome. Investigating HCC pathogenesis in model organisms is therefore crucial for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been instrumental in recapitulating the local and systemic features of HCC. Early studies using GEMMs and patient material implicated members of the dimeric Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, such as c-Jun and c-Fos, in HCC formation. In a recent report, we described how switchable, hepatocyte-restricted expression of a single-chain c-Jun~Fra-2 protein, functionally mimicking the c-Jun/Fra-2 AP-1 dimer, results in spontaneous and largely reversible liver tumors in GEMMs. Dysregulated cell cycle, inflammation, and dyslipidemia are observed at early stages and tumors display molecular HCC signatures. We demonstrate that increased c-Myc expression is an essential molecular determinant of tumor formation that can be therapeutically targeted using the BET inhibitor JQ1. Here, we discuss these findings with additional results illustrating how AP-1 GEMMs can foster preclinical research on liver diseases with novel perspectives offered by the constantly increasing wealth of HCC-related datasets.","The adult central nervous system (CNS) possesses a limited capacity for self-repair. Severed CNS axons typically fail to regrow. There is an unmet need for treatments designed to enhance neuronal viability, facilitate axon regeneration, and ultimately restore lost neurological functions to individuals affected by traumatic CNS injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and other neurological disorders. Here we demonstrate that both mouse and human bone marrow (BM) neutrophils, when polarized with a combination of recombinant interleukin (IL)-4 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), upregulate alternative activation markers and produce an array of growth factors, thereby gaining the capacity to promote neurite outgrowth. Moreover, adoptive transfer of IL-4/G-CSF polarized BM neutrophils into experimental models of CNS injury triggered substantial axon regeneration within the optic nerve and spinal cord. These findings have far-reaching implications for the future development of autologous myeloid cell-based therapies that may bring us closer to effective solutions for reversing CNS damage.",0
"BackgroundLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens people’s health worldwide. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in regulating LUAD growth and metastasis as well as in therapeutic response. However, currently, there is a lack of integrative analysis of PCD-related signatures of LUAD for accurate prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response.MethodsThe bulk transcriptome and clinical information of LUAD were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. A total of 1382 genes involved in regulating 13 various PCD patterns (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, netotic cell death, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, parthanatos, autophagy-dependent cell death, oxeiptosis, alkaliptosis and disulfidptosis) were included in the study. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were performed to identify PCD-associated differential expression genes (DEGs). An unsupervised consensus clustering algorithm was used to explore the potential subtypes of LUAD based on the expression profiles of PCD-associated DEGs. Univariate Cox regression analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, Random Forest (RF) analysis and stepwise multivariate Cox analysis were performed to construct a prognostic gene signature. The “oncoPredict” algorithm was utilized for drug-sensitive analysis. GSVA and GSEA were utilized to perform function enrichment analysis. MCPcounter, quanTIseq, Xcell and ssGSEA algorithms were used for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. A nomogram incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics was established to predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.ResultsForty PCD-associated DEGs related to LUAD were obtained by WGCNA analysis and differential expression analysis, followed by unsupervised clustering to identify two LUAD molecular subtypes. A programmed cell death index (PCDI) with a five-gene signature was established by machine learning algorithms. LUAD patients were then divided into a high PCDI group and a low PCDI group using the median PCDI as a cutoff. Survival and therapeutic analysis revealed that the high PCDI group had a poor prognosis and was more sensitive to targeted drugs but less sensitive to immunotherapy compared to the low PCDI group. Further enrichment analysis showed that B cell-related pathways were significantly downregulated in the high PCDI group. Accordingly, the decreased tumor immune cell infiltration and the lower tumor tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) scores were also found in the high PCDI group. Finally, a nomogram with reliable predictive performance PCDI was constructed by incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics, and a user-friendly online website was established for clinical reference ( performed the first comprehensive analysis of the clinical relevance of genes regulating 13 PCD patterns in LUAD and identified two LUAD molecular subtypes with distinct PCD-related gene signature which indicated differential prognosis and treatment sensitivity. Our study provided a new index to predict the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and the prognosis of LUAD patients for guiding personalized treatments.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05000-w.","BackgroundThyroid carcinoma (THCA) represents a prevalent form of cancer globally, with its incidence demonstrating an upward trend in recent years. Accumulating evidence has indicated that programmed cell death (PCD) patterns exert a vital influence on tumor progression. Nevertheless, the association between PCD and the prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma remains to be elucidated. The current study endeavors to examine the link between PCD and the prognosis of thyroid cancer while concurrently developing a prognostic index based on PCD genes.Materials and methodsProgrammed cell death patterns were employed to construct the model and define clusters. Gene expression profile genomics and clinical data pertaining to 568 patients with thyroid cancer were sourced from the TCGA database. In addition, single-cell transcriptome data GSE184362 were procured from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for subsequent analysis.ResultsThe study harnessed six machine learning algorithms to create a programmed cell death signature (PCDS). Ultimately, the model developed via SVM was chosen as the optimal model, boasting the highest C-index. Moreover, the application of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) led to the identification of two molecular subtypes of THCA, each characterized by distinct vital biological processes and drug sensitivities. The investigation revealed that PCDS is linked to chemokines, interleukins, interferons, and checkpoint genes, as well as pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment, as determined through a comprehensive analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomes. Patients with THCA and elevated PCDS values are more inclined to exhibit resistance to conventional chemotherapy regimens, yet may display heightened responsiveness to targeted therapeutic agents. Finally, we established a nomogram model based on multivariable cox and logistic regression analyses to predict the overall survival of THCA patients.ConclusionThis research sheds new light on the role of programmed cell death (PCD) patterns in THCA. By conducting an in-depth analysis of various cell death patterns, a novel PCD model has been devised, capable of accurately predicting the clinical prognosis and drug sensitivity of patients with THCA.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05252-6.",1
"AbstractBackgroundEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ and EBV- primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) carry distinct mutational landscapes, but their transcriptional and epigenetic profiles have not been integrated and compared. This precludes further insights into pathobiology and molecular differences, relevant for classification and targeted therapy.MethodsTwenty-three EBV- and 15 EBV+ PCNSL, histologically classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, were subjected to RNA-sequencing and EPIC methylation arrays. Unsupervised clustering analyses were performed. Differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes were identified and integrated.ResultsTwo distinct transcriptional clusters were found, which separated EBV- and EBV+ PCNSL (P < .0001). The EBV+ transcriptional signature contained genes (GPR15, FCER2/CD23, SLAMF1/CD150) closely regulated by EBV oncogenes in B cells. Pathway enrichment analysis uncovered enhanced B-cell receptor (BCR) and WNT/beta-catenin signaling in EBV- lymphomas, whereas Interleukin-10, NOTCH, and viral life cycle pathways were upregulated in EBV+ PCNSL. Correspondingly, BCR-associated SYK kinase activity was enriched in EBV- tumors while JAK2 was overrepresented in EBV+ PCNSL. Epigenetic profiling revealed reduced global promoter methylation in EBV+ PCNSL. Two methylation clusters were recognized, which separated EBV- and EBV+ PCNSL (P < .0001). Epigenetic profiles were distinct from 2,788 other brain tumor and nonmalignant reference samples. Promoter region hypermethylation of CD79B, a BCR subunit critical for sustained proliferation in EBV- disease, highly correlated (R = −0.7) with its transcriptional downregulation in EBV+ PCNSL.ConclusionsEBV+ and EBV- PCNSL harbor distinct transcriptional and epigenetic profiles, corroborating them as distinctive biological subtypes. Uncovered differences provide novel insights into their pathobiology, may guide molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies.","Background and Clinical Significance: Radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) following immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has been infrequently reported. Case Presentation: We present a 47-year-old female patient who developed RRD of the breast following three doses of pembrolizumab administered as an adjuvant treatment post-nephrectomy for Stage III renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Notably, the affected breast had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy 247 weeks earlier for Stage IA invasive ductal carcinoma. She had received no prior chemotherapy at any point. RRD manifested as breast induration, erythema, and peau d’orange, and contraction of breast volume was noted following three cycles of pembrolizumab on week 17 (400 mg dose every 6 weeks). The dermatitis responded rapidly to systemic corticosteroids and no treatment interruption was needed. Conclusions: To date, this is the longest reported interval from completion of radiotherapy to RRD. A literature search underscores the variability in presentation and management of ICI-associated RRD.",0
"BackgroundBladder cancer (BLCA) is a prevalent urological tumor with high morbidity and mortality. However, BLCA treatment remains challenging due to a lack of effective biomarkers. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), as active participants in tumor progression are involved in multiple biological regulatory mechanisms, and cuproptosis-related genes participate in the development of cancer. It is important to discover cuproptosis- related lncRNAs for BLCA diagnosis and treatment.MethodsA predictive signature was constructed based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses of the 9 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs. Samples were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group based on their median risk scores to explore their prognosis.ResultsThis signature is well predictive, as evidenced by the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) and K-M curves. Based on the nomogram, we were able to visually forecast the survival rates of patients with BLCA at 1-, 3-, and 5-year, and the calibration plots displayed that the actual results were well matched with the predicted 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, BLCA patients in the high-risk group had a higher Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score and lower TMB. Finally, we investigated the response of antitumor drugs for BLCA patients in different risk groups, and a statistically significant difference was observed in the sensitivity of those drugs between low- and the high-risk groups.ConclusionAccording to the 9 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs, we constructed a signature which can be served as a promising prognostic biomarker for BLCA patients.","PurposeIn recent times, multiple molecular subtypes with varying prognoses have been identified in bladder cancer (BLCA). However, the attributes of butyrate metabolism-related (BMR) molecular subtypes and their correlation with immunotherapy response remain inadequately explored in BLCA.MethodsWe utilized 594 samples of BLCA to investigate the molecular subtypes mediated by BMR genes and their correlation with the immunotherapy response. To quantify the BMR features of individual tumors, we developed a BMR score through the COX and LASSO regression methods. Clinical-related, tumor microenvironment, drug-sensitive and immunotherapy analyses were used to comprehensively analyze BMR scores.ResultsTwo distinct molecular subtypes related to butyrate metabolism were identified in BLCA, each with unique prognostic implications and immune microenvironments. BMR score was constructed based on 7 BMR genes and was used to classify the patients into two score groups. Clinical analysis revealed that the BMR score was an independent prognostic factor. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. The BMR score can also predict tumor immunity. The results demonstrated that a low BMR score was associated with higher efficacy of immunotherapy, which was also validated by an external dataset.ConclusionOur study proposes both molecular subtypes and a BMR-based score as promising prognostic classifications in BLCA. These findings may offer new insights for the development of precise targeted cancer therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05067-5.",1
"AbstractBackgroundThe rate of primary surgery for human papillomavirus (HPV)–related oropharynx cancer has recently declined, whereas use of transoral robotic surgery has lagged at community cancer centers. We hypothesize that differences in overall survival exist between patients undergoing surgery for HPV-related oropharynx cancer at community centers and low transoral robotic surgery volume (<15 transoral robotic surgeries per year) academic centers and high transoral robotic surgery volume (≥15 transoral robotic surgeries per year) academic centers.MethodsPatients from the US National Cancer Database with a diagnosis of HPV-related oropharynx cancer from 2010 to 2019 who underwent primary surgical treatment were included. Trends in transoral robotic surgery use, rates of positive surgical margins, quality of adjuvant treatment, and 5-year overall survival were compared between community centers, low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers, and high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers.ResultsA total of 5406 patients met study criteria. A clinically and statistically significantly lower proportion of patients at community centers underwent transoral robotic surgery than at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers or high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers (26.2% vs 44.0% vs 73.9%, respectively; P < .001). The rate of positive surgical margins was clinically and statistically significantly higher at community centers than at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers or high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers (25.7% vs 15.3% vs 9.2%, respectively; P < .001). A greater proportion of patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) received prolonged courses (23.6% vs 13.1% vs 8.8%; P < .001) or excessive doses (16.5% vs 11.5% vs 8.7%; P < .001) of RT at community centers than at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers or high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers, respectively. Five-year overall survival was lowest at community centers (85.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 81.7% to 88.2%), intermediate at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers (88.9%, 95% CI = 87.2% to 90.4%), and highest at high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers (91.4%, 95% CI = 89.5% to 92.9%; Plog-rank < .01).ConclusionsClinically and statistically significant differences in the type and quality of surgical and adjuvant treatment for HPV-related oropharynx cancer exist between facility types based on transoral robotic surgery volume. Overall survival was lowest at community centers, intermediate at low transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers, and highest at high transoral robotic surgery volume academic centers.","BACKGROUND & AIMS:Single-agent anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors convey outstanding clinical benefits in a small fraction (w20%) of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) but the molecular mechanisms determining response are unknown. To fill this gap, we herein analyze the molecular and immune traits of aHCC in patients treated with anti-PD1.METHODS:Overall, 111 tumor samples from patients with aHCC were obtained from 13 centers before systemic therapies. We performed molecular analysis and immune deconvolution using whole-genome expression data (n = 83), mutational analysis (n = 72), and histologic evaluation with an endpoint of objective response.RESULTS:Among 83 patients with transcriptomic data, 28 were treated in frontline, whereas 55 patients were treated after tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) either in second or third line. Responders treated in frontline showed upregulated interferon-γ signaling and major histocompatibility complex II–related antigen presentation. We generated an 11-gene signature (IFNAP), capturing these molecular features, which predicts response and survival in patients treated with anti-PD1 in frontline. The signature was validated in a separate cohort of aHCC and >240 patients with other solid cancer types where it also predicted response and survival. Of note, the same signature was unable to predict response in archival tissue of patients treated with frontline TKIs, highlighting the need for fresh biopsies before immunotherapy.CONCLUSION:Interferon signaling and major histocompatibility complex–related genes are key molecular features of HCCs responding to anti-PD1. A novel 11-gene signature predicts response in frontline aHCC, but not in patients pretreated with TKIs. These results must be confirmed in prospective studies and highlights the need for biopsies before immunotherapy to identify biomarkers of response.",0
"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B has been recognized as a major determinant of discrepancies in disease outcomes, and recent evidence suggests a role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) efficacy. The B44 supertype, which features an electropositive binding pocket that preferentially displays peptides with negatively charged amino acid anchors, associated with improved survival in ICB-treated melanoma. Yet this effect was not seen in ICB-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we show that mutations leading to glutamic acid substitutions occur more often in melanoma than NSCLC based on mutational landscape. We additionally show stratifying B44 based on the presence of somatic mutations that lead to negatively charged glutamic acid anchors identifies NSCLC patients with ICB benefit similar to that seen in melanoma. We anticipate these findings could improve assessment of HLA-related outcomes and prediction of ICB benefit in those with B44, representing approximately half of the world’s population.","BackgroundSeveral translational animal models have been described assessing intra-arterial (IA) treatments for malignant gliomas. We describe the first endovascular animal model that allows testing of IA drug delivery as a first-line treatment, which is difficult to do in actual patients. We report a unique protocol for vascular access and IA delivery in the rat model that, unlike prior reports, does not require direct puncture and opening of proximal cerebrovasculature which carries risk of ischemia in the animal brain post-delivery.MethodsWistar rats underwent left femoral artery catherization with a Balt Magic 1.2F catheter or Marathon Flow directed 1.5F Microcatheter with an Asahi Chikai 0.008 micro-guidewire which was navigated to the left internal carotid artery under x-ray. 25% mannitol was administered to test blood brain barrier breakdown (BBBB). Additional rats were implanted with C6 glioma cells in the left frontal lobe. C6 Glioma-Implanted Rats (C6GRs) were monitored for overall survival and tumor growth. Tumor volumes from MRI images were calculated utilizing 3D slicer. Additional rats underwent femoral artery catheterization with Bevacizumab, carboplatin, or irinotecan injected into the left internal carotid artery to test feasibility and safety.ResultsA successful endovascular access and BBBB protocol was established. BBBB was confirmed with positive Evans blue staining. 10 rats were successfully implanted with C6 gliomas with confirmed growths on MRI. Overall survival was 19.75 ± 2.21 days. 5 rats were utilized for the development of our femoral catheterization protocol and BBBB testing. With regards to IA chemotherapy dosage testing, control rats tolerated targeted 10 mg/kg of bevascizumab, 2.4 mg/kg of carboplatin, and 15 mg/kg of irinotecan IA ICA injections without any complications.ConclusionsWe present the first endovascular IA rat glioma model that allows selective catheterization of the intracranial vasculature and assessment of IA therapies for gliomas without need for access and sacrifice of proximal cerebrovasculature.",0
"ABSTRACTSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) has been proved to be able to effectively down-regulate gene expression through the RNAi mechanism. Thus, siRNA-based drugs have become one of the hottest research directions due to their high efficiency and specificity. However, challenges such as instability, off-target effects and immune activation hinder their clinical application. This review explores the mechanisms of siRNA and the challenges in siRNA-based tumor therapy. It highlights the use of various nanomaterials – including lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and inorganic nanoparticles – as carriers for siRNA delivery in different therapeutic modalities. The application strategies of siRNA-based nanomedicine in chemotherapy, phototherapy and immunotherapy are discussed in detail, along with recent clinical advancements. Aiming to provide insights for future research and therapeutic approaches.","PurposeThe applications of liposomes are limited due to poor structural stability and short drug circulation time. This study aims to build an albumin-based liposomal delivery system to provide strategies for tumor specificity, efficient gene delivery and effective release of albumin liposomes.MethodsIn this study, siRNA loaded PDL1-targeted albumin liposome was constructed for the treatment of lung cancer and its function was evaluated. Physical parameters such as particle size, potential and infrared spectrum were detected and microscopic morphology was observed by electron microscopy to detect the binding and uptake capacity of albumin liposome with cells. The optimal preparation process and binding ratio of PDL1-targeted albumin liposome/siRNA complex were determined.ResultsThe constructed siRNA loaded PDL1-targeted albumin liposomes has low toxicity, high loading rate and tumor cell targeted gene therapy ability. Moreover, it increased T cell activation and down-regulated siRNA expression, effectively realizing the inhibition of lung cancer cells.ConclusionThe results showed that the PDL1-targeted albumin liposome could be used as a high efficient delivery vector of siRNA, and was a high efficient and safe nano vector for tumor targeted gene therapy.",1
"Aim: To investigate the systemic immune-inflammation index and prognostic immune nutritional index in the prognostic evaluation of oral squamous cell carcinoma.Materials & methods: We analyzed retrospectively the relationship between systemic immune-inflammation index, prognostic immune nutritional index and clinicopathological variables and the overall survival of 262 patients who underwent radical surgery.Results: Multivariate analysis showed high systemic immune-inflammation index (Hazard ratio = 3.062, 95% CI: 1.021–8.251), low prognostic immune nutritional index (Hazard ratio = 0.297, 95% CI: 0.139–0.636), tumor node metastasis classification 3–4 (Hazard ratio = 9.862, 95% CI: 4.658–20.880) patients have worse overall survival.Conclusion: Preoperative systemic immune-inflammation index and prognostic immune nutritional index are independent risk factors for prognostic survival status in oral squamous cell carcinoma.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with clinical benefit in lung cancer. However, response patterns to immunotherapy, including pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, are difficult to diagnose, and their mechanisms remain unclear. This review aimed to describe two response patterns observed in lung cancer, namely pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, including their epidemiology, diagnostic characteristics, and plausible mechanisms.MethodsWe performed a comprehensive literature search in the PubMed database, using keywords “pseudoprogression”, “hyperprogression”, and “lung cancer”, among others. The literature was examined for pseudoprogression and hyperprogression characteristics and plausible mechanisms.ResultsPseudoprogression manifests in multiple forms; however, the immune system-related response criteria and biopsy data are helpful to make accurate diagnosis. Serological biomarkers, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), might help distinguish pseudoprogression from true progression. The incidence of hyperprogression ranges within 5–19.2%, depending on definition. The unique response pattern of rapid progression is observed not only with immunotherapy, but also with other treatment regimens. Molecular mutations and amplifications may result in hyperprogression; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear.ConclusionAtypical response patterns, such as pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, are increasingly common in clinical practice. Immune-related response criteria can help diagnose pseudoprogression. Molecular mechanisms of hyperprogression remain unclear. Biomarkers for pseudoprogression and hyperprogression are required.",0
"AbstractDespite standard-of-care therapy, pediatric brain tumors are now the leading cause of cancer-related death in children, highlighting an urgent need for the development of new treatments. Immunotherapy is actively being evaluated as a therapeutic approach to pediatric brain tumors, however, more research is needed to reveal additional antigenic targets that exist in these malignancies. In this study, our team performed a transcriptomic analysis of pediatric brain tumor RNA sequencing data within the Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) to identify intra and extracellular antigens that are highly expressed across major tumor types. Interestingly, our team observed that most tumors had high gene expression of a group of antigens that were unique to that specific tumor type. Specifically, our analysis revealed that diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) highly expressed the extracellular antigens CA9, CTCFL, and ST8SIA1, whereas atypical rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) highly expressed MUC1 and TEK. Other tumors that displayed high gene expression for a variety of antigenic targets included H3-wildtype high-grade gliomas (HGGs), and ependymomas (EPNs). Strikingly, we observed minimal difference in antigen expression in primary tumors when compared to patient-matched recurrences. Beyond antigen expression, we evaluated the expression of antigen processing machinery (APM) which includes major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Our findings revealed that DMGs had the lowest level of APM expression, however, these tumors uniquely expressed high levels of the immune checkpoints ADORA2A, CD276, and KLRC1. Contrarily, ATRTs showed a high expression of immune checkpoints CD274 (PD-L1), PVR, and CD80. Other tumors included in our analysis had unique expression patterns of antigen, as well as APM and immune checkpoints. Our findings illustrate that pediatric brain tumors have distinct expression patterns of antigens, APM, and immune checkpoints that are specific to tumor type, emphasizing diverse, rather than general, immunotherapeutic approaches must be considered for childhood brain tumors.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are uniquely capable of transporting tumoral antigens to tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs), and also interact with effector T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) itself, mediating both natural antitumor immunity and the response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Using LIPSTIC (Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts)-based single-cell transcriptomics, we identify individual DCs capable of presenting antigen to CD4+ T cells in the tdLN as well as inside the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our findings reveal that DCs with similar hyperactivated transcriptional phenotypes interact with helper T cells both within tumors and in the tdLN, and that checkpoint blockade drugs enhance these interactions. These findings show that a relatively small fraction of DCs is responsible for most of the antigen presentation within the tdLN and TME to both CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T cells and that classical checkpoint blockade enhances CD40-driven DC activation at both sites.",0
"AbstractBackgroundPreclinical cancer studies ascribe promising anticancer properties to metformin. Yet, clinical findings vary, casting uncertainty on its therapeutic value for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We hypothesized that metformin could benefit obese and overweight patients with NSCLC.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 2 clinical cohorts and employed complementary mouse models to test our hypothesis. One cohort included NSCLC patients with overweight body mass index (≥25 kg/m2, n = 511) and nonoverweight body mass index (<25 kg/m2, n = 232) who underwent lobectomy, evaluating metformin’s impact on clinical outcomes. Another cohort examined metformin’s effect on progression-free survival after immune checkpoint inhibitors in overweight (n = 284) vs nonoverweight (n = 184) NSCLC patients. Metformin’s effects on tumor progression, antitumor immunity, and immune checkpoint inhibitor response in obese and normal-weight mice were assessed with lung cancer models.ResultsMetformin is associated with increased recurrence-free survival in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.94; P = .035) after lobectomy. It also corrected accelerated tumor growth in diet-induced obese mouse models in a lymphocyte-specific manner while reversing several mechanisms of immune suppression potentiated by obesity. Programmed cell death 1 blockade coupled with metformin was more effective at limiting tumor burden in obese mice and correlated with progression-free survival only in overweight patients on immunotherapy (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.93; P = .024).ConclusionsMetformin may improve lung cancer–specific clinical outcomes in obese and overweight lung cancer patients and enhance immunotherapy efficacy in this growing population. This work identifies obesity as a potential predictive biomarker of metformin’s anticancer and immunotherapy-enhancing properties in lung cancer while shedding light on the underlying immunological phenomena.","BackgroundExosomes are extracellular nanometric vesicles used by cells to communicate with each other. They are responsible for many pathological conditions, including tumors by transferring regulatory biomolecules that impact target cell activity. Because of their high concentration in exosomes compared with parental cells and the rest of exosomal content, specificity to the cell of origin, and their well-organized sorting mechanism, microRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to be the most potent exosomes cargo and used by scientists to track exosomes and to detect cell activity changes and prognosis in cancer early.PurposeIn this review, the results of studies examining the role of exosomes in cancer pathophysiology and their clinical potential are discussed in detail.Summary of the FindingsTumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) mediate the dynamic changes of cancer growth and invasion, including local microenvironment remodeling, distance metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor-associated immunosuppression. They also contribute to hypoxia-induced tumor progression and cancer cell drug resistance. As a result of exosomes being present in all body fluids, it is possible to have early accessible and less-invasive diagnostic and prognostic measures by forming a table for each cancer type and its matched specific miRNAs. Under testing, available therapeutic uses of exosomes include interference of exosomes biogenesis, secretion, or uptake, and recruitment of exosomes as target-specific drug delivery vehicles, and immunostimulatory agents for both cancer patients and healthy population to avoid cancer development from the start.ConclusionThese data suggest that exosomes and exosomal microRNA are directly related to cancer progression mechanisms, and could be used in cancer early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.",0
"Background and aimAccording to previous reports, GTPase of immunity-associated protein 6 (GIMAP6) is essential for autophagy. However, it is unclear how GIMAP6 affects the development and tumor immunity of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).MethodsIn the present study, the role of GIMAP6 in vivo and in vitro was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting, and Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and Transwell assays. Datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were thoroughly analyzed using R software. A nomogram was created using GIMAP6 and prognostic characteristics. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were applied to explore the potential mechanism of GIMAP6 in lung cancer. The link between GIMAP6 and the immunological landscape was studied using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0 and Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub.ResultsPatients with high GIMAP6 expression had improved overall and disease-specific survival compared with those patients with low GIMAP6 expression. According to the receiver operating characteristic and calibration curve, the nomogram based on T stage, N stage and GIMAP6 had predictive value for prognosis. According to functional enrichment analysis, GIMAP6 was primarily involved in T-cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction. GIMAP6 was shown to be favorably linked with the infiltration of immune cells and immune-related molecules, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, programmed death-ligand 1, and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, by single-cell sequencing and TIMER2.0 analysis. The role of GIMAP6 in lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and immunity was experimentally verified.ConclusionThese findings confirmed that GIMAP6 was an effective prognostic molecule that was involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment of LUAD, and may become a predictor for the efficacy of immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04980-z.","Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been associated with susceptibility and protection against a number of cancers. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to evaluate the overall influence of 127 HLA Class I and II alleles on 30 types of cancer. We found a preponderance of protective alleles (negatively correlated with cancer prevalences), especially for HLA Class I. Of the 30 cancers investigated, 13 were associated with mostly protective HLA effects whereas only 2 were associated with mostly susceptibility HLA alleles. Taken together, these findings highlight the broad influence of HLA on cancer and the complexity of HLA-cancer associations.",1
"ObjectiveCellular cannibalism (CC) is a prime metabolic event to determine the aggressive potential of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the etiology and mechanism behind this degradation are still ambiguous. The aim of the study was to explore the etiopathogenetic mechanism behind CC, along with its association with degree of differentiation, angiogenic, phagocytic and antiapoptotic activity in OSCC.DesignSeventy-three tissue sections of various histological grades of OSCC were retrieved from departmental archives and scanned for cannibalistic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using CD31, CD68, and BCL2 was performed. The data obtained were analyzed using Chi-square, Spearman’s correlation test and multiple regression analysis (p < 0.05).ResultsCCs were present significantly in various grades of OSCC (p < 0.00). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant difference in CD68, BCL2 (p < 0.05 in both), and CD31 (p < 0.001) expression with CC. The internalized cells showed positivity for CD68 and negativity for BCL2. Regression analysis revealed that tumor grade, CD31 and BCL2 immunoreactivity were significant predictors of frequency of CC.ConclusionThe association of CC with degree of differentiation, CD31, CD68, and BCL2 expression could predict the biological behavior of OSCC and might serve as a promising histopathological parameter in future.","PurposeThis study was conducted to investigate impacts of potential anticancer (associated with apoptosis and caspase pathways) of two newly synthesized derivatives of pillararene, named as d-Q-P5 and p-Q-P5, on Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) cells.Materials and methodsThe MTT method was used to determine the IC50 doses of the derivatives on HNSCC cells, and the changes in gene expression were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The apoptosis change was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis.ResultsThe results showed that the d-Q-P5 and p-Q-P5 effectively inhibited the proliferation of the cells by upregulating proapoptotic genes (Bax, Bad, p53, Bak, and Apaf-1) and genes involved in the caspase pathway (Casp2, Casp3, and Casp9), while downregulating the antiapoptotic gene (Bcl-2).ConclusionsThis study is the first to demonstrate the potential anticancer effects of these two agents on HNSCC cells by positively regulating apoptosis gene expression.",1
"AbstractApigenin, a potent natural flavonoid, has emerged as a key therapeutic agent due to its multifaceted medicinal properties in combating various diseases. However, apigenin's clinical utility is greatly limited by its poor water solubility, low bioavailability and stability issues. To address these challenges, this review paper explores the innovative field of nanotechnology-based delivery systems, which have shown significant promise in improving the delivery and effectiveness of apigenin. This paper also explores the synergistic potential of co-delivering apigenin with conventional therapeutic agents. Despite the advantageous properties of these nanoformulations, critical challenges such as scalable production, regulatory approvals and comprehensive long-term safety assessments remain key hurdles in their clinical adoption which must be addressed for commercialization of apigenin-based formulations.","ObjectiveTo investigate the effects of cytokines IL-2 and GM-CSF on CXCR3 expression and chemotaxis of CAR-T cells.BackgroundHigh lymphocyte infiltration within the tumor is a basic requirement for good results in tumor immunotherapy; C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) is an important factor for the chemotaxis of lymphocytes to tumor tissues. The tumor microenvironment can exhibit diverse cytokine suppression or promote antitumor immunity. Both interleukin (IL)-2 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) contribute to the regulation of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. However, the effects of IL-2 and GM-CSF on CXCR3 expression on the T cell surface and its mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we explored the effects of polycytokines on CXCR3 expression in chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) and on HuH-7 in situ hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, followed by purifying using CD3 immunomagnetic beads. Cells were divided into three groups. After 24h of activation using CD3/CD28 antibody, T cells were transfected using lentiviral vector, pGC-SV40-EGFP-GPC3-CAR. Three culture methods were used to amplify the transfected T cells. Method ‘A’ was to incubate T cells with CD3/CD28 antibody; method ‘B’ was with CD3/CD28 antibody and IL-2 at a final concentration of 1000 U/ml; method ‘C’ was with method B in addition of GM-CSF at a final concentration of 1000 U/ml. The phosphorylation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT was determined by western blot. The chemotaxis effect of CAR-T cells on Huh-7 HCCIA in situ was assayed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry.ResultsThe CD3/CD28/IL-2/GM-CSF combination is the most potent for stimulating activated CAR-T cell proliferation and CXCR3 expression in vitro; CD3/CD28/IL-2 induces CAR-T cell expression of CXCR3 through the activation of the PI3K/APK pathway and GM-CSF induces CXCR3 expression in CAR-T cells through the activation of ERK1/2 rather than the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. CAR-GPC3-T cells with high CXCR3 expression showed increased chemotaxis ability to HuH in situ hepatocellular carcinoma, and considerably inhibited the growth of in situ tumors in nude mouse livers.ConclusionA multi-factorial amplification protocol can effectively improve CXCR3 expression on the surface of activated CAR-T cells in vitro, as well as enhance the chemotaxis ability of CAR-T cells in vivo, which significantly inhibit the growth of liver cancer.",0
"PurposeThe anti-inflammatory environment of glioma reduces the efficacy of immunotherapies. Therefore, it is vital to transform the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma into a pro-inflammatory environment. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) can serve as immune checkpoint targets that enhance the anti-tumor immune response. However, the roles of Siglecs in the glioma microenvironment are unknown. This study was conducted to identify targets to inhibit the anti-inflammatory environment to improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with glioma.MethodsWe analyzed the regulatory effect of prognosis-related Siglecs identified from data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) and China Glioma Genome Atlas Data portal on the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma. The effects of prognosis-related Siglecs on the glioma microenvironment were investigated by determining the Pearson correlation coefficients of the Siglecs in transcriptome data from the TCGA database.ResultsSiglec-1, -9, -10, and -14 were closely associated with the prognosis of patients with glioma. The expression of these four Siglecs was significantly increased in the high-risk group and positively correlated with anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in the glioma microenvironment.ConclusionOur study provides insights into the effects of prognosis-related Siglecs in glioma immunotherapy, suggesting that targeted prognosis-related Siglecs can modify the microenvironment of glioma and improve the sensitivity of patients with glioma to immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03762-9.","PurposeTumor immunotherapy has the advantages of high specificity, minimal damage to the patient’s body, and a long-lasting anti-tumor effect. However, due to the existence of immune escape phenomenon, the effect of anti-tumor immunotherapy is still poor. Therefore, a cancer vaccine that reverses tumor-associated immunosuppression is a very promising approach for research and treatment.MethodsVaccines were prepared using autologous and allogeneic tumor cells and their lysates to syngeneic tumor cell lysates as immunogens. The glioma cell proliferation, apoptosis and the secretion level of MCP-2, IFN-γ were detected to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment against glioma in vitro. In addition, a rat glioma model was established to investigate the anti-tumor effect in vivo, and evaluated its efficacy by observing the changes of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, NK cells, and the level of IL-2 and IL-10 in peripheral blood before and after treatment.ResultsThe C6 + 9L glioma cell lysate vaccine (C6 + 9L-CL) not only inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells and promoted their apoptosis in vitro, but also significantly inhibited the tumor growth in vivo and improved the survival time of rats. In addition, the C6 + 9L-CL vaccine enhanced the anti-tumor immune response by promoting the secretion of T cell chemokines MCP-2, IFN-γ and IL-2, and by stimulating the proliferation of T cells and NK cells in peripheral blood and glioma tissues.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate the inhibitory effect of molecular mimic vaccines on glioma and provided a theoretical basis for molecular mimic hybrid vaccines as a potential therapeutic approach.",1
"PurposeThere is not much progress in the treatment for lung squamous cell carcinoma LSCC in the past few years. Rapamycin Rapa, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR, has exhibited antitumor efficacy in a variety of malignant tumors. It has recently been reported that Rapamycin can induce autophagy signaling pathway in lung cancer and Glypican-3GPC3 can promote the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by stimulating canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of rapamycin’s antitumor efficacy in relation to GPC3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy in LSCC.MethodsSK-MES-1 cells, a LSCC cell line, were treated with various concentrations of rapamycin with or without Glypican-3 GPC3-targeting siRNA. SK-MES-1 cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Protein expression levels of GPC3, β-catenin, Beclin-1 were checked via western blotting. We established the xenograft mice model to investigate the suppression effect of rapamycin on LSCC. In addition, we further testified the metabolism protein of autophagy process using the xenograft tumor tissue. ResultsRapamycin could inhibit the SK-MES-1 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the GPC3 expression and downregulating the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we found that GPC3 silencing can activate the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy, which contribute to the suppression of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionRapamycin suppresses the growth of lung cancer through down-regulating glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which mediates with activation of autophagy. This study suggests GPC3 is a new promising target for rapamycin in the treatment of lung cancer.","Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) serves a key immunosuppressive role as a negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. HPK1 loss-of-function is associated with augmentation of immune function and has demonstrated synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in syngeneic mouse cancer models. These data offer compelling evidence for the use of selective small molecule inhibitors of HPK1 in cancer immunotherapy. We identified a novel series of isoquinoline HPK1 inhibitors through fragment-based screening that displayed promising levels of biochemical potency and activity in functional cell-based assays. We used structure-based drug design to introduce key selectivity elements while simultaneously addressing pharmacokinetic liabilities. These efforts culminated in a molecule demonstrating subnanomolar biochemical inhibition of HPK1 and strong in vitro augmentation of TCR signaling in primary human T-cells. Further profiling of this molecule revealed excellent kinase selectivity (347/356 kinases <50% inhibition @ 0.1 μM), a favorable in vitro safety profile, and good projected human pharmacokinetics.",0
"PurposeThis study examined the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) in tumor cells and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma according to histological subtypes.MethodsWe evaluated PD-L1, PD-L2, and IDO1 expression in tumor cells and CD8-positive TILs in surgically resected specimens from 196 stage 0 or I lung adenocarcinoma patients by immunohistochemical staining. We also examined the relationships between the expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, and IDO1 in tumor cells and the density of CD8-positive TILs and clinical factors. Patients were divided into three groups: A, adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (N = 32); B, lepidic predominant invasive adenocarcinoma (IAD; LPA; N = 66); and C, IAD except for LPA (N = 98).ResultsPD-L1 was expressed only in Group C, but not in Groups A or B. The positive ratio of PD-L2 was significantly higher in Group C (63.3%), and that of IDO1 was also significantly higher in Group C (65.3%). The density of CD8-positive TILs was significantly higher in Group C (45 ± 2.4). There was no significant difference between the positive ratios of PD-L2 and IDO1 and the density of CD8-positive TILs in Group A (50.0%, 21.9%, and 36 ± 4.1, respectively) or Group B (60.6%, 25.8%, and 44 ± 3.0, respectively).ConclusionsNo cases in Groups A and B expressed PD-L1. The expression of immune-related factors, especially PD-L1 and IDO1, was significantly associated with Group C. This is the first report of the detailed examination of PD-L1, PD-L2, IDO1, and CD8 expression in lung adenocarcinoma subtypes with lepidic predominant components. Our results could help identify patients who would benefit from perioperative immunotherapy.","PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.",1
"The association of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) with melanoma has been well documented. Similarly, the outcome of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) in melanoma depends, to some extent, on the HLA genotype of the patient. Although specific favorable (or unfavorable) HLA alleles for CBI outcome for melanoma have been identified, there is currently no reliable way to predict a positive, neutral or negative melanoma CBI outcome for other alleles. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to identify HLA alleles whose frequency is negatively (or positively) associated with melanoma prevalence (protective or susceptibility alleles, respectively). The findings demonstrated that, indeed, HLA alleles that are negatively associated with melanoma prevalence in the population have been associated with good CBI outcome at the individual level and, conversely, HLA alleles that are positively associated with melanoma prevalence have been associated with poor CBI outcome in individuals. Given this good prediction of CBI cancer immunotherapy by specific immunogenetically discovered HLA alleles, we used this epidemiologic immunogenetic approach to identify more HLA Class I and II alleles protective (or susceptibility) for melanoma which would thus be good predictors of CBI outcomes in those cancers. This is a new approach to successfully (a) identify HLA protective or susceptibility alleles for melanoma, and (b) use that information in anticipating outcomes in CBI cancer immunotherapy.","PurposeEmerging evidence suggests that pyroptosis plays an essential role in the development and progression of multiple cancers. However, the role of pyroptosis remains elusive in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).MethodsThe expression profile data of DLBCL and normal samples of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) were analyzed, and the clinical characteristics of DLBCL patients were further investigated. A prognostic model was established using LASSO-Cox regression analysis. The expression of these PRGs was validated by qRT-PCR in DLBCL cell lines. Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry were utilized to explore the impact of pyroptosis inhibitor (disulfiram, DSF) combined with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor (BMS1166) on DLBCL cell proliferation.ResultsMost PRGs were dysregulated in DLBCL samples and associated with overall survival (OS). Six PRGs were selected to construct a prognostic risk score model. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that CASP8, CASP9, NLRP1, NLRP6, and TIRAP are downregulated, while SCAF11 was significantly upregulated in DLBCL cell lines. This prognostic model divided DLBCL patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited lower mortality and longer OS than those in the high-risk group. The ROC curve and nomogram demonstrated this model's excellent predictive performance. GO and KEGG enrichment indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between subgroups were associated with cellular protein modification processes and JAK-STAT signaling pathway regulation. Moreover, the risk score was correlated with the immune profile. Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry further validated the synergistic anti-tumor effects of DSF and BMS1166 on DLBCL cells.ConclusionIn summary, we developed a comprehensive prognostic model based on PRGs characteristics, which accurately predicted the prognosis of DLBCL patients. Pyroptosis-targeting coupled with immunotherapies would be a promising therapeutic strategy for DLBCL.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05018-0.",0
"BackgroundSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine cancer with a high risk of early mortality (that is, survival time less than 1 month). This study aimed to identify relevant risk factors and predict early mortality in SCLC patients.MethodsA total of 27,163 SCLC cases registered between 2010 and 2019 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Significant independent risk factors were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Nomograms for all-causes and cancer-specific early death were constructed and evaluated.ResultsAge, sex, clinical stage, presence of metastasis (liver and lung), and absence of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) were identified for significant association with all-causes and cancer-specific early death. Nomograms based on these predictors exhibited high accuracy (area under ROC curve > 0.850) and potential clinical practicality in the prediction of early mortality.ConclusionWe identified a set of factors associated with early mortality from SCLC and developed a clinically useful nomogram to predict high-risk patients. This nomogram could aid oncologists in the administration of individualized treatment regimens, potentially improving clinical outcomes of SCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05003-7.","The wide application of increasingly advanced molecular studies in routine clinical practice has allowed a detailed, albeit still incomplete, genetic subclassification of undifferentiated round cell sarcomas.

"ObjectiveFolate receptor alpha (FRα) is overexpressed on >90% of high-grade epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC). Targeting FRα with antibody-drug conjugates has proven utility in the platinum-resistant setting. It is also a potential therapeutic target for immuno-oncologic agents, such as peptide vaccines that work primarily via adaptive and humoral immunity. We tested the hypothesis that FRα peptide immunization could improve outcomes in patients with EOC following response to platinum-based therapy.MethodsWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TPIV200 (a multi-epitope FRα peptide vaccine admixed with GM-CSF) versus GM-CSF alone in 120 women who did not have disease progression after at least 4 cycles of first-line platinum-based therapy. Patients were vaccinated intradermally once every 4 weeks up to 6 times, followed by a boosting period of 6 vaccinations at 12-week intervals. Primary endpoints included safety, tolerability, and progression free survival (PFS).ResultsAt study termination with a median follow-up of 15.2 months (range 1.2 – 28.4 months), 68 of 119 intention-to-treat patients had disease progression (55% in TPIV200 + GM-CSF arm and 59% in GM-CSF alone arm). The median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI 8.3 – 16.6 months) with no significant difference between the treatment groups (10.9 months with TPIV200 + GM-CSF versus 11.1 months with GM-CSF, HR, 0.85; upper 90% CI 1.17]. No patient experienced a ≥ grade 3 drug-related adverse event.ConclusionTPIV200 was well tolerated but was not associated with improved PFS. Additional studies are required to uncover potential synergies using multiepitope vaccines targeting FRα.","In gynecological oncology, ovarian cancer (OC) remains the most lethal, highlighting its significance in public health. Our research focused on the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in OC, particularly senescence-related lncRNAs (SnRlncRNAs), crucial for OC prognosis. Utilizing data from the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) and cancer genome Atlas (TCGA), SnRlncRNAs were discerned and subsequently, a risk signature was sculpted using co-expression and differential expression analyses, Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). This signature's robustness was validated through time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and multivariate Cox regression, with further validation in the international cancer genome consortium (ICGC). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) unveiled pathways intertwined with risk groups. The ROC, alongside the nomogram and calibration outcomes, attested to the model's robust predictive accuracy. Of particular significance, our model has demonstrated superiority over several commonly utilized clinical indicators, such as stage and grade. Patients in the low-risk group demonstrated greater immune infiltration and varied drug sensitivities compared to other groups. Moreover, consensus clustering classified OC patients into four distinct groups based on the expression of 17 SnRlncRNAs, showing diverse survival rates. In conclusion, these findings underscored the robustness and reliability of our model and highlighted its potential for facilitating improved decision-making in the context of risk assessment, and demonstrated that these markers potentially served as robust, efficacious biomarkers and prognostic tools, offering insights into predicting OC response to anticancer therapeutics.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00163-z.",1
"Pancreatic cancer is a significant public health concern, with increasing incidence rates and limited treatment options. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, in the development and progression of this disease. Microbial dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota, has been implicated in pancreatic carcinogenesis through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances. Researchers have identified specific microbial signatures associated with pancreatic cancer, offering potential biomarkers for early detection and prognostication. By leveraging advanced sequencing and bioinformatics tools, scientists have delineated differences in the gut microbiota between pancreatic cancer patients and healthy individuals, providing insights into disease pathogenesis and potential diagnostic strategies. Moreover, the microbiome holds promise as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer treatment. Interventions aimed at modulating the microbiome, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have demonstrated potential in enhancing the efficacy of existing cancer therapies, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These approaches can influence immune responses, alter tumor microenvironments, and sensitize tumors to treatment, offering new avenues for improving patient outcomes and overcoming therapeutic resistance. Overall, understanding the complex interplay between the microbiome and pancreatic cancer is crucial for advancing our knowledge of disease mechanisms and identifying innovative therapeutic strategies. Here we report phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA microbial sequences of the pancreatic cancer mice microbiome and corresponding age matched healthy mice microbiome. We successfully identified differentially abundant microbiota in pancreatic cancer.","Despite significant progress in antibiotic discovery, millions of lives are lost annually to infections. Surprisingly, the failure of antimicrobial treatments to effectively eliminate pathogens frequently cannot be attributed to genetically-encoded antibiotic resistance. This review aims to shed light on the fundamental mechanisms contributing to clinical scenarios where antimicrobial therapies are ineffective (that is, antibiotic failure), emphasizing critical factors impacting this under-recognized issue. Explored aspects include biofilm formation and sepsis, as well as the underlying microbiome. Therapeutic strategies beyond antibiotics, are examined to address the dimensions and resolution of antibiotic failure, actively contributing to this persistent but escalating crisis. We discuss the clinical relevance of antibiotic failure beyond resistance, limited availability of therapies, potential of new antibiotics to be ineffective, and the urgent need for novel anti-infectives or host-directed therapies directly addressing antibiotic failure. Particularly noteworthy is multidrug adaptive resistance in biofilms that represent 65 % of infections, due to the lack of approved therapies. Sepsis, responsible for 19.7 % of all deaths (as well as severe COVID-19 deaths), is a further manifestation of this issue, since antibiotics are the primary frontline therapy, and yet 23 % of patients succumb to this condition.",0

This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer, focusing on its differential expression patterns, prognostic implications, genetic alterations, and associations with the tumor microenvironment.Methods and resultsUsing large-scale datasets, including GTEx, TCGA, HPA, and cBioPortal, we analyzed FKBP1A expression across normal tissues and various cancer types. Our findings revealed that FKBP1A exhibited aberrant upregulation in most human cancers, making it a potential biomarker for malignancy. Moreover, FKBP1A expression correlated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, disease-free interval, and progression-free interval in several cancers, indicating its prognostic significance. Genetic alteration analysis showed that FKBP1A gene amplification was prevalent, particularly in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, FKBP1A expression was associated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, highlighting its potential involvement in tumor-immune response. Notably, FKBP1A expression positively correlated with stromal and immune cell scores, suggesting its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, according to the functional enrichment analysis, experimental validation in lung adenocarcinoma confirmed the role of FKBP1A through the regulation of EGFR signaling by apoptosis, which is consistent with drug sensitivity analysis to some extent.ConclusionIn conclusion, FKBP1A exhibits differential expression in cancer, serves as a prognostic indicator, undergoes genetic alterations, and influences the tumor-immune microenvironment. These findings shed light on the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer development and progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and guidance of clinical drugs selection, and provide valuable insights into patient prognosis for interventions based on pharmaceuticals.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05362-1.",1
"Adipocytes are crucial components of breast cancer and are involved in regulating the progression, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Characterized by storing energy and producing a variety of secretory factors, adipocytes are responsible for inducing obesity and regulating the tumor immune activity. Adipocytes communicate with tumor infiltrating immune cells through the secreted adipokines, cytokines, and exosomes in the breast cancer TIME, which shapes the tumor supporting environment to facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. In-depth studies of the crosstalk between adipocytes and TIME can not only provide a more comprehensive regulatory landscape of TIME, but also be conducive to screening novel targets for future precision targeted therapy. The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies for understanding the role of crosstalk between adipocytes and immune cells in shaping the breast cancer immune microenvironment.","Introduction:ERBB2 or HER2 alterations are found in approximately 2% to 5% of NSCLCs; most are exon 20 insertion mutations. The efficacy and safety of poziotinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, were assessed in patients with treatment-naive NSCLC whose tumors harbor HER2 exon 20 insertions.Methods:ZENITH20 is an open-label, multicohort, multicenter, global, phase 2 trial. ZENITH20-C4 enrolled treatment-naive patients with NSCLC with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 insertions. Poziotinib was administered 16 mg once daily (QD) or 8 mg twice daily (BID). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review. Secondary and exploratory end points included disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety.Results:A total of 80 patients (16 mg QD, n = 47; 8 mg BID, n = 33) were treated in ZENITH20-C4. ORR was 39% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28%–50%; 31 of 80), with a disease control rate of 73% (95% CI: 61%–82%; 58 of 80); 80% of the patients experienced tumor reduction. Median duration of response was 5.7 (95% CI: 4.6–11.9) months, and median progression-free survival was 5.6 (95% CI: 5.4–7.3) months. The most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were rash (QD, 45%; BID, 39%), stomatitis (QD, 21%; BID, 15%), and diarrhea (QD, 15%; BID, 21%). Among all subtypes of HER2 exon 20 insertions, seven patients (9%) harboring tumors with G778_P780dupGSP had the best clinical outcomes (ORR, 71%).Conclusions:Poziotinib was found to have clinically meaningful efficacy with a manageable toxicity profile for patients with treatment-naive NSCLC harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations.",0
"PurposeThere is gender-specific disparity in bladder cancer (BlCa) prognosis. Female BlCa patients present with more advanced tumor and have higher risks of disease recurrence, progression, and mortality than males. Since gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) family genes were critical genes in gender-related biological activity and could be detected in BlCa specimens, this study aimed to explore potential roles of GNRH1 and GNRHR in gender disparity of BlCa. MethodsRNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma dataset, IMvigor210 immunotherapy cohort and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database were used to compare potential roles of GNRH1 and GNRHR in males and females, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to analyze the biological functions.ResultsMales with higher GNRH1 and GNRHR have better overall survival (P < 0.05, HR < 1), while females with higher expression have a trend toward worse overall survival (P < 0.05, HR > 1). Gene set enrichment analysis identified GNRH1 and GNRHR exert opposite regulatory roles in myogenesis (M5909), interferon-α response (M5911), interferon-γ response (M5913), inflammatory response (M5932) and TNF-α signaling via NF-κβ (M5890) between males and females. The five functions are up-regulated in females (NES > 0), while down-regulated in males (NES < 0). GNRH1 in females was positively correlated with CD3D (R-value > 0 and P < 0.05), while GNRHR in males was negatively correlated with CD247, CD3D and CD3E (R-value < 0 and P < 0.05).ConclusionGNRH1 and GNRHR have opposite effects on overall survival in different genders, and exert opposite roles in immune-related functions between different genders, which could emerge as a contributor to gender disparity of BlCa prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04640-2.","BackgroundT cells have been proven to play important roles in anti-tumor and tumor microenvironment shaping, while these roles have not been explained in bladder cancer (BLCA).MethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to screen T-cell marker genes. Bulk RNA-sequencing data and clinical information from BLCA patients were downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database to develop a prognosis signature. We analyzed the association of different risk groups with survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and immunotherapy response.ResultsBased on 192 T-cell marker genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis, we constructed a prognostic signature containing 7 genes in the training cohort, which was further validated in the testing cohort and GEO cohort. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 1-, 3-, and 5 years were 0.734, 0.742 and 0.726 in the training cohort, 0.697, 0.671 and 0.670 in the testing cohort, 0.702, 0.665 and 0.629 in the GEO cohort, respectively. In addition, we constructed a nomogram based on clinical factors and the risk score of the signature. The low-risk group exhibited higher immune-related pathways, immune cell infiltration and TMB levels. Importantly, immunophenotype score and immunotherapy cohort (IMvigor210) analyses showed that the low-risk group had better immunotherapy response and prognosis.ConclusionsOur study reveals a novel prognostic signature based on T-cell marker genes, which provides a new target and theoretical support for BLCA patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04881-1.",1
"PurposeLung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is an aggressive subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in the development of LUSC. We aim to identify potential therapeutic targets and a TME-related prognostic signature and for LUSC.MethodsTME-related genes were obtained from TCGA-LUSC dataset. LUSC samples were clustered by the non-negative matrix clustering algorithm (NMF). The prognostic signature was constructed through univariate Cox regression, multivariate Cox regression, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out to explore the enrichment pathways.ResultsThis study constructed a prognostic signature which contained 12 genes: HHIPL2, PLK4, SLC6A4, LSM1, TSLP, P4HA1, AMH, CLDN5, NRTN, CDH2, PTGIS, and STX1A. Patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the median risk score of this signature. Compared with low-risk group patients, patients in high-risk group patients had poorer overall survival, which demonstrated this signature was an independent prognostic factor. Besides, correlation analysis and GSEA results revealed that genes of this signature were correlated with immune cells and drug response.ConclusionOur novel signature based on 12 TME-related genes might be applied as an independent prognostic indicator. Importantly, the signature could be a promising biomarker and accurately predict the prognosis of LUSC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05042-0.","BackgroundColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, which imposes a significant societal burden. Regular screening and emerging molecular tumor markers have important implications for detecting the progression and development of colorectal cancer. Disulfidptosis is a newly defined type of programmed cell death triggered by abnormal accumulation of disulfide compounds in cells that stimulate disulfide stress. Currently, there is no relevant discussion on this mechanism and colorectal cancer.MethodsWe classified the disulfidptosis-related subtypes of colorectal cancer using bioinformatics methods. Through secondary clustering of differentially expressed genes between subtypes, we identified characteristic genes of the disulfidptosis subtype, constructed a prognostic model, and searched for potential biomarkers through clinical validation.ResultsUsing disulfidptosis-related genes collected from the literature, we classified colorectal cancer patients from public databases into three subtypes. The differentially expressed genes between subtypes were clustered into three gene subtypes, and eight characteristic genes were screened to construct a prognostic model.ConclusionThe disulfidptosis mechanism has important value in the classification of colorectal cancer patients, and characteristic genes selected based on this mechanism can serve as a new potential biological marker for colorectal cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05211-1.",1
"One in six deaths worldwide is caused by cancer, making it a major global health concern. Despite their effectiveness, traditional treatment approaches such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery frequently have negative side effects and high costs. New approaches, such as gene therapy, are promising but are hampered by high costs and accessibility problems. Nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate targeted drug delivery by leveraging passive targeting mechanisms, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and by actively targeting surfaces with ligands for site-specific binding through the functionalization of surfaces. This approach enhances therapeutic results while lowering off-target toxicities. Notably, chemotherapeutic medications, immunotherapeutic agents, and photothermal therapies can now be delivered more precisely to the affected site using NP-based systems. By boosting particularity, reducing side effects, and tackling drug resistance, nanomedicine has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and ultimately advance personalized oncological care. These advancements highlight the possibilities for field growth, and future development regulations are detailed.","Addressing the urgent need for innovative depression treatments, this study heralds a breakthrough in major depressive disorder (MDD) therapy by intertwining clinical observations with neurobiological advancements. We analyzed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in serum exosomes from a diverse group of 60 individuals, including first-episode, drug-free MDD patients, medicated MDD patients, and healthy controls. Our results revealed a significant decrease in BDNF levels within MDD patients’ exosomes, which notably increased post-medication, highlighting BDNF’s potential as a biomarker for both MDD diagnosis and treatment efficacy. Advancing these clinical findings, we developed RVG-modified exosomes engineered to overexpress BDNF (RVG-BDNF-Exos), designed to directly target neuronal cells. Our findings demonstrate that these engineered exosomes can successfully traverse the blood–brain barrier, targeting neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In our mouse model of depression induced by lipopolysaccharide, RVG-BDNF-Exos treatment led to a significant increase of BDNF in these key brain regions, crucial for mood regulation and neurogenesis. This intervention modulated the BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling pathway, central to neural plasticity and implicated in depression’s pathogenesis. Behavioral assessments exhibited substantial improvements in depressive-like behaviors in mice treated with RVG-BDNF-Exos, including reduced immobility in Tail Suspension and Forced Swim Tests. Additionally, our treatment effectively decreased neuroinflammation, as evidenced by the reduction in microglia and astrocyte numbers. Moreover, RVG-BDNF-Exos treatment enhanced neurogenesis and regulated synaptic plasticity, as indicated by the increased expression of neuronal markers MAP2 and DCX, and synaptic proteins PSD95 and Syn-1. In conclusion, this study not only underscores the clinical potential of serum exosomal BDNF as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker for MDD but also demonstrates the efficacy of RVG-BDNF-Exos in alleviating depressive symptoms. Our findings pave the way for future targeted, personalized psychiatric treatments, offering a promising direction in MDD therapy.",0
"IntroductionMetastasis remains the major cause of death in breast cancer (BrCa) and lacks specific treatment strategies. The kynurenine pathway (KP) has been suggested as a key mechanism facilitating progression of BrCa. While KP activity has been explored in primary BrCa, its role in metastasis remains unclear. To better understand this, we examined changes in the KP of BrCa with no metastasis compared to BCa that produced local or distant metastases. Given that the cancer cell secretome plays a role in metastasis, we also investigated the relationship between changes in KP activity and serum proteins of patients with local or distant metastases.MethodsTo investigate changes in the KP in BrCa, with and without metastasis, we quantified KP metabolites in blood sera collected from patients with stage 1 BrCa (n = 34), BrCa with local metastases (n = 46), BrCa with distant metastases (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 39). The serum protein profile of the BrCa patients with local or distant metastasis was determined before correlation analyses were carried out to examine the relationship between changes in the KP and cancer serum proteins using SPSS.ResultsWe found that the KP was elevated in BrCa patients with local and distant metastasis compared to healthy controls and stage 1 BrCa patients. The activity of kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) and kynureninase (KYNU) A was positively associated with disease stage and was higher compared to healthy controls. Proteome analysis in patients with local or distant metastasis revealed the dysregulation of 14 proteins, 9 of which were up-regulated and 5 down-regulated at the distant metastasis stage. Importantly, three of these proteins have not been previously linked to BrCa metastasis. In the correlation studies between the KP profile, cancer serum proteins and metastasis status, KYNU A had the greatest number of significant associations with cancer serum protein, followed by KMO.ConclusionOur findings reveal that the KP was regulated differently at various stages of BrCa and was more dysregulated in patients with local or distant metastasis. These KP activity changes showed a significant association with cancer serum proteins in BrCa patients with local or distant metastasis, highlighting the potential role of KP in BrCa metastasis.","Background and Clinical Significance: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but may underlie diverse and potentially life-threatening immune-related adverse events (irAEs). They may cause various conditions leading to respiratory failure, including myasthenic syndromes and myositis. However, diaphragmatic paralysis (DP) has rarely been reported. To describe patients with diaphragmatic paralysis in a pharmacovigilance registry, we searched the prospective REISAMIC registry at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center (Villejuif, France) for cases of diaphragmatic palsy (DP) occurring from September 2014 to December 2021. Case Presentation: We identified three patients, in whom DP was confirmed by diaphragmatic ultrasonography, pulmonary function tests, and/or diaphragmatic electroneuromyogram. Diaphragmatic palsy was life-threatening in all patients, as it caused respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In all cases, a pre-existing subclinical paraneoplastic syndrome was detected. Onconeural antibodies (anti-titin and anti-VGCC) were detected in these patients before and after the initiation of ICI therapy, suggesting a mixed paraneoplastic syndrome with features overlapping those of myasthenic syndrome (myasthenia gravis in one patient and Lambert–Eaton syndrome in another) and myositis. Conclusions: Diaphragmatic palsy is a severe irAE potentially resulting from different mechanisms, including myositis and neuromuscular junction involvement (myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton). Antineuronal antibodies associated with such conditions were already present in our patients prior to immunotherapy initiation, suggesting ICIs could trigger flare-ups of pre-existing silent paraneoplastic autoimmune conditions.",0
"IntroductionPoliovirus receptor (PVR) is a tumor promoter and a regulatory checkpoint that enhances immunosuppression. We investigated PVR expression by applying immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A positive association existed between PVR expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) expression in patients with surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PVR expression is a prognosis predictor of lung adenocarcinoma.PurposeTo investigate the prognostic significance of PVR expression and CTLA4 expression for surgically resected NSCLC.Patients and methodsThe medical records of 108 Chinese patients with primary NSCLC who underwent surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of PVR and CTLA4 were measured through IHC. Clinical characteristics, the association between PVR and CTLA4, and the prognostic significance of PVR were analyzed.ResultsA significant positive association was observed between PVR and CTLA4 expression in NSCLC (P = 0.016). PVR had a high positive rate among females, nonsmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma and advanced lung cancer. The overall survival (OS) of patients with negative PVR expression was significantly longer than that of patients with positive PVR expression (P = 0.049), especially among females (P = 0.03) and nonsmokers (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis results showed that advanced tumor stage and PVR expression were independent prognosis predictors of poor OS.ConclusionPVR can potentially serve as a prognostic predictor and biomarker for NSCLC and cancer anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03189-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeWe aimed to assess the predictive value of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) therapy using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted at Seoul National University Hospital. Patients with EGFR/ALK-wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received ICBs between December 2013 and December 2019 were enrolled. Patients with archived blood samples collected prior to ICB treatment were assigned to the ELISA cohort. In addition, those with tissue samples from sites of recurrence or metastasis were assigned to an IHC cohort. Then, we analyzed Gal-3 expression in both cohorts.ResultsFifty-six patients in the ELISA cohort were grouped into low (N = 36) and high (N = 20) groups, using the mean Gal-3 ELISA level (13.24 pg/ml) as a cutoff. The high group demonstrated trends toward reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (0.9 vs. 3.7 months, p = 0.196) and significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (1.6 vs. 12.3 months, p = 0.018) than the low group. We categorized 94 patients in the IHC cohort into negative (N = 31) and positive (N = 63) groups based on Gal-3 IHC positivity. However, the median PFS (4.6 vs. 4.6 months for the negative vs. positive IHC group, respectively, p = 0.345) and OS (16.4 vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.137) were not significantly different.ConclusionHigh blood Gal-3 levels may predict inferior survival in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with ICBs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04275-9.",1
"PurposeTo evaluate the efficacy of repeat transurethral resection on restaging, preventing tumor recurrence and progression in high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients who received initial en bloc resection.Methods and patientsWe reviewed retrospectively the clinical records of 330 consecutive patients who received en bloc resection for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Eligible patients with and without repeat transurethral resection were matched 1:1 by propensity score. Important covariates were balanced between the two groups. We compared the recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, recurrence rate, and progression rate between groups. And the perioperative results regarding residual tumors and the safety of the repeat resection were also evaluated.ResultsFinally, there are 245 patients included in our analysis with a median follow-up duration of 19 months (range 3–50). Detrusor muscle presented in 244 (99.6%) specimens at initial en bloc resection. And among them, 30 (12.2%) patients had undergone a repeat resection and 215 (87.8%) did not. After 1:1 propensity score matching, 30 pairs were further analyzed.No case of upstaging was identified in repeat resection. During the follow-up, recurrence was observed in 5 (16.7%) and 7 (23.3%) patients in reresection group and non-reresection group, respectively. And progression was found only in 1 (3.3%) patient in each group. The 1-year recurrence-free survival estimates were comparable (86.7% vs 83.3%, p = 0.86) between groups.ConclusionOur study demonstrates that repeat resection after initial transurethral en bloc resection for bladder tumor appears not to improve staging accuracy, recurrence, and progression.","BackgroundBladder cancer has a high rate of recurrence and drug resistance due to the lack of effective therapies. IR-780 iodide, a near-infrared (NIR) mitochondria-targeting fluorescent agent, has been demonstrated to achieve higher selectivity than other drugs in different tumor types and exhibited tumor-killing effects in some cancers. However, this therapeutic strategy is rarely studied in bladder cancer.Material and methodsThe accumulation of IR-780 in bladder cancer was measured by NIR imaging. Human bladder cell lines (T24, 5637, and TCCSUP) were treated with IR-780 or combined IR-780 and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). Cell viability, cell apoptosis, cellular ATP production, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and plasma membrane potential were detected. Mitochondrial complex I protein NDUFS1 was measured by western blot. To confirm the anti-tumor efficacy of IR-780 + HBO, mouse bladder cell line (MB49) tumor-bearing mice were established and tumor size and weight were recorded. Besides, cell apoptosis and tumor size were assessed in drug-resistant bladder cancer cells (T24/DDP) and xenografts to evaluate the effect of IR-780 + HBO on drug-resistant bladder cancer.ResultsIR-780 selectively accumulated in bladder cancer (bladder cancer cells, transplanted tumors, and bladder cancer tissue from patients) and could induce cancer cell apoptosis by targeting the mitochondrial complex I protein NDUFS1. The combination with HBO could significantly enhance the anti-tumor effect of IR-780 in vitro by promoting cancer cell uptake and inducing excessive mitochondrial ROS production, while suppressing tumor growth and recurrence in animal models without causing apparent toxicity. Moreover, this combination antitumor strategy was also demonstrated in drug-resistant bladder cancer cells (T24/DDP) and xenografts.ConclusionWe identified for the first time a combination of IR-780 and HBO (IR-780 + HBO), which exhibits mitochondria-targeting and therapeutic capabilities, as a novel treatment paradigm for bladder cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04385-4.",1
"AbstractBackgroundSarcomatoid carcinomas (SC) are rare tumors with both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, linked to aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Sarcomatoid carcinoma of unknown primary (SCUP) is an exceedingly rare subset with limited literature and no standardized management guidelines. This study aims to characterize the clinical presentations, treatment patterns, and genomic landscape of SCUP.Patients and MethodsData were retrospectively collected from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cancer of Unknown Primary Registry. Patients included had biopsy-proven SC with no identifiable primary tumor despite comprehensive diagnostic evaluations. Baseline characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) results, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Kaplan–Meier survival estimates, and Cox proportional hazards regression.ResultsFifty-two SCUP patients were identified, with a median age of 60 years. Most patients presented with widely metastatic disease, particularly lytic bone lesions. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was noted in nearly half of the patients. IHC showed high positivity for AE1/AE3 and OSCAR antibodies. Tumor NGS revealed 247 alterations, with TP53 being the most common mutation. Patients receiving definitive therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 72 months, significantly longer than those receiving systemic therapy (14 months). Immunotherapy was a significant prognostic factor, reducing the risk of death by 90%.ConclusionsThis study provides essential insights into the clinical and genomic characteristics of SCUP, advocating for the integration of definitive therapy and immunotherapy in treatment protocols. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and improve patient outcomes.","PurposePediatric solid tumors are significantly different from adult tumors. Studies have revealed genomic aberrations in pediatric solid tumors, but these analyses were based on Western populations. Currently, it is not known to what extent the existing genomic findings represent differences in ethnic backgrounds. ExperimentalDesignWe retrospectively analyzed the basic clinical characteristics of the patients, including age, cancer type, and sex distribution, and further analyzed the somatic and germline mutations of cancer-related genes in a Chinese pediatric cohort. In addition, we investigated the clinical significance of genomic mutations on therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic, and preventive actions. ResultsOur study enrolled 318 pediatric patients, including 234 patients with CNS tumors and 84 patients with non-CNS tumors. Somatic mutation analysis showed that there were significant differences in mutation types between CNS tumors and non-CNS tumors. P/LP germline variants were identified in 8.49% of patients. In total, 42.8% patients prompted diagnostic, 37.7% patients prompted prognostic, 58.2% patients prompted therapeutic, and 8.5% patients prompted tumor-predisposing and preventive, and we found that genomic findings might improve clinical management.ConclusionsOur study is the first large-scale study to analyze the landscape of genetic mutations in pediatric patients with solid tumors in China. Genomic findings in CNS and non-CNS solid pediatric tumors provide evidence for the clinical classification and individualized treatment of pediatric tumors, and they will facilitate improvement of clinical management. Data presented in this study should serve as a reference to guide the future design of clinical trials.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04756-5.",0
"Cellular membrane-derived vesicles (CMVs) have recently attracted attention as a drug delivery system (DDS) because CMVs offer unique advantages, including nanosized particles, superior transcellular cross-communication, excellent biocompatibility, and active targeting ability. However, some challenges remain in the design and production of CMVs, such as their low yield, chemical and mechanical instability, and difficulties in functionalizing membrane surfaces. In this paper, we introduce three strategies to overcome the limitation of CMVs. First, hybrid vesicles combined CMVs from cellular membranes with synthetic liposomes (SLs) offer new engineering solutions to tackle such issues. The membrane fusion of SLs and CMVs can increase their production yield and stability while allowing for the presentation of surface proteins from donor cells. Additional compounds, such as targeted ligands and imaging agents, can be easily integrated into CMVs by using functionalized SLs. Second, core/shell nanostructures composed of synthetic nanoparticles as cores and cell membrane structures as shells can offer unique advantages for improving the stability and preservation of the inherent capabilities of the various nanoparticles in these core/shell nanostructures. Lastly, CMV/scaffold complexes are also a pronounced approach for DDSs because the scaffold structures help CMVs or loaded therapeutic agents to sustained release. The sustainable released system extends the bioavailability of CMVs or loaded therapeutic agents for a long time in vivo. Altogether, we suggest a combination strategy of hybrid vesicle-coated nanoparticles or hybrid vesicle/scaffold complex could be a promising drug delivery system.","BACKGROUNDLittle is known about the impact of residential segregation on early detection, treatment, and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a predominant type of lung cancers.RESEARCH QUESTIONDoes racialized economic segregation play a role in NSCLC treatment and outcomes and contribute to racial disparities?STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSThis study included non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients with NSCLC diagnosed between 2007 and 2015 and identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset. County-level racialized economic segregation was estimated using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE). Multilevel logistic regression and multilevel Cox regression accounting for county-level clustering were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for late-stage diagnosis and treatment underutilization, and hazard ratio (HR) for mortality.RESULTSOf 203,441 patients, 85.8% were NHW and 14.2% were NHB. Compared with patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of high-income NHW households (lowest ICE quintile), patients living in the counties with the highest concentration of low-income NHB households (highest ICE quintile) had higher risks of late-stage diagnosis (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.02–1.16; Ptrend <.001), underutilization of guideline-recommended treatment (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.16–1.41; Ptrend <.0001), lung cancer-specific mortality (HR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.07–1.14; Ptrend <.0001), and overall mortality (HR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.09–1.16; Ptrend <.0001). The association between segregation and treatment underutilization was stronger in NHW than NHB patients (Pinteraction =0.02). There was no significant difference in the segregation-related risk of late-stage diagnosis, lung cancer-specific mortality, or overall mortality between NHW and NHB patients.INTERPRETATIONLiving in segregated, low-income NHB counties had adverse impacts on early detection, treatment, and outcomes of NSCLC. However, residential segregation did not explain the excess risks of NSCLC care underutilization and mortality in NHB patients compared with NHW patients.",0
"BackgroundCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an essential component of the tumor immune microenvironment that are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We aim to investigate the characteristics of CAFs in prostate cancer and develop a biochemical recurrence (BCR)-related CAF signature for predicting the prognosis of PCa patients.MethodsThe bulk RNA-seq and relevant clinical information were obtained from the TCGA and GEO databases, respectively. The infiltration scores of CAFs in prostate cancer patients were calculated using the MCP counter and EPIC algorithms. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was downloaded from the GEO database. Subsequently, univariate Cox regression analysis was employed to identify prognostic genes associated with CAFs. We identified two subtypes (C1 and C2) of prostate cancer that were associated with CAFs via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. In addition, the BCR-related CAF signatures were constructed using Lasso regression analysis. Finally, a nomogram model was established based on the risk score and clinical characteristics of the patients.ResultsInitially, we found that patients with high CAF infiltration scores had shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) times. Subsequently, CAFs in four pairs of tumors and paracancerous tissues were identified. We discovered 253 significantly differentially expressed genes, of which 13 had prognostic significance. Using NMF clustering, we divided PCa patients into C1 and C2 subgroups, with the C1 subgroup having a worse prognosis and substantially enriched cell cycle, homologous recombination, and mismatch repair pathways. Furthermore, a BCR-related CAFs signature was established. Multivariate COX regression analysis confirmed that the BCR-related CAFs signature was an independent prognostic factor for BCR in PCa. In addition, the nomogram was based on the clinical characteristics and risk scores of the patient and demonstrated high accuracy and reliability for predicting BCR. Lastly, our findings indicate that the risk score may be a useful tool for predicting PCa patients’ sensitivity to immunotherapy and drug treatment.ConclusionNMF clustering based on CAF-related genes revealed distinct TME immune characteristics between groups. The BCR-related CAF signature accurately predicted prognosis and immunotherapy response in prostate cancer patients, offering a promising new approach to cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05011-7.","PurposeTo evaluate a radiomic approach for the stratification of diffuse gliomas with distinct prognosis and provide additional resolution of their clinicopathological and molecular characteristics.MethodsFor this retrospective study, a total of 704 radiomic features were extracted from the multi-channel MRI data of 166 diffuse gliomas. Survival-associated radiomic features were identified and submitted to distinguish glioma subtypes using consensus clustering. Multi-layered molecular data were used to observe the different clinical and molecular characteristics between radiomic subtypes. The relative profiles of an array of immune cell infiltrations were measured gene set variation analysis approach to explore differences in tumor immune microenvironment.ResultsA total of 6 categories, including 318 radiomic features were significantly correlated with the overall survival of glioma patients. Two subgroups with distinct prognosis were separated by consensus clustering of radiomic features that significantly associated with survival. Histological stage and molecular factors, including IDH status and MGMT promoter methylation status were significant differences between the two subtypes. Furthermore, gene functional enrichment analysis and immune infiltration pattern analysis also hinted that the inferior prognosis subtype may more response to immunotherapy.ConclusionA radiomic model derived from multi-parameter MRI of the gliomas was successful in the risk stratification of diffuse glioma patients. These data suggested that radiomics provided an alternative approach for survival estimation and may improve clinical decision-making.",1
"Background: Medication dosing in overweight and obese children often involves complex weight-based calculations, leading to higher dosing errors, particularly with intravenous drugs. Currently, tools to aid in dosage calculations are lacking for these patients, especially in Thai population. Objective: This study aimed to develop a mobile application with the intent of utilizing it as a tool to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of dosing calculations required for obese and overweight Thai children. Methods: The performance of the application was assessed in 3 key aspects using a sample of 30 healthcare professionals. These key aspects included: 1) the accuracy of dosage calculations, assessed through pre- and posttests comparing manual calculations to app-based calculations using a 10-item questionnaire, 2) the time taken for calculations before and after app usage, 3) user satisfaction, which was measured through a questionnaire. Results: The integration of applications into the calculation demonstrated a significant improvement when compared to the manual calculation in both accuracy (6.10 vs 9.33 out of 10, P < .001) and efficiency (10.40 vs 8.53 minutes per 10 questions, P = .008). Also, the application elicited high levels of satisfaction among users, as reflected by an overall mean satisfaction score of 4.57 on a 5-point scale. Conclusion: The integration of this application to assist in dosage calculations for overweight and obese pediatric Thai patients has yielded favorable outcomes concerning accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Further development should be pursued within a larger cohort, with an emphasis on real-world implementation in clinical settings.","Aim: The clinical efficacy of systemic chemotherapy is limited due to the nonspecific delivery of anticancer drugs and is associated with serious systemic adverse effects.

Nutritional indices, immune function, adverse emotions, self-efficacy, self-care ability, quality of life and toxic reactions during chemotherapy were recorded in postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer receiving routine care (control group) and MDT-style continuity of care combined with whole-process nutritional care (intervention group).Results: After care, the intervention group performed higher BMI, PA, TP and ALB, CD3+, CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+, lower levels of CD8+, lower self-rating anxiety scale, self-rating depression scale and QLQ-C30 symptom domain scores and higher general self-efficacy scale, exercise of self-care agency scale and QLQ-C30 functional domain scores versus the control group (all p < 0.05).Conclusion: MDT-style continuity of care combined with whole-process nutritional care can improve the nutritional status of postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer, and in turn enhance their quality of life.",0
"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been associated with susceptibility and protection against a number of cancers. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to evaluate the overall influence of 127 HLA Class I and II alleles on 30 types of cancer. We found a preponderance of protective alleles (negatively correlated with cancer prevalences), especially for HLA Class I. Of the 30 cancers investigated, 13 were associated with mostly protective HLA effects whereas only 2 were associated with mostly susceptibility HLA alleles. Taken together, these findings highlight the broad influence of HLA on cancer and the complexity of HLA-cancer associations.","IntroductionWe described the patterns of chemotherapy use and outcomes in patients diagnosed with stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by age in England.Materials and MethodsIn this retrospective population-based study, we included 20,716 (62% stage IV) patients with NSCLC diagnosed from 2014 to 2017 treated with chemotherapy. We used the Systemic Anti-Cancer Treatment (SACT) dataset to describe changes in treatment plan and estimated 30 and 90-day mortality rates and median, 6-, and 12-month overall survival (OS) using Kaplan Meier estimator for patients aged <75 and ≥ 75 by stage. Using flexible hazard regression models we assessed the impact of age, stage, treatment intent (stage III), and performance status on survival.ResultsPatients aged ≥75 years were less likely to receive two or more regimens, more likely to have their treatment modified because of comorbidities and their doses reduced compared to younger patients. However, early mortality rates and overall survival were similar across ages, apart from the oldest patients with stage III disease.DiscussionThis observational study demonstrates that age is associated with treatment patterns in an older population with advanced NSCLC in England. Although this reflects a pre-immunotherapy period, given the median age of NSCLC patients and increasingly older population, these results suggest older patients (>75 yrs) may benefit from more intense treatments.",1
"Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) has a poor prognosis. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) significantly affects the development and progression of various human tumors. However, the significance and pathological mechanisms of CDKN2A in COAD remain to be elucidated. We assessed expression levels, clinical significance, biological function, co-expressed genes, and enrichment of related pathways of CDKN2A in COAD using various databases, including The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, Human Protein Atlas, STRING, GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, and Linked Omics. Our investigation showed that CDKN2A was highly expressed in colon adenocarcinomas (P < .001). It is weakly expressed or not expressed in normal tissues. The survival time of patients with colon adenocarcinoma with high CDKN2A expression is significantly shorter than that of patients with low expression levels (P = .011). There was a significant positive correlation between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and the infiltration of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Moreover, there was a significant negative association between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and B cell infiltration. The ten hub genes included tumor protein 53, V-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten, cyclin D1, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, catenin beta 1, and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase. Mutations in the CDKN2A genome in colon adenocarcinoma reduce survival. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in apoptotic signaling pathways and multiple pathways related to metabolic progression. Our results indicate that CDKN2A can be used as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with colon adenocarcinoma. CDKN2A may regulate the occurrence and development of colon adenocarcinomas by influencing immune cell infiltration and metabolic pathways.","BackgroundSepsis is a frequent cause of Acute Lung Injury (ALI), characterized by immune dysregulation and a high mortality rate. The role of cuproptosis, a recently discovered cell death mechanism, in sepsis-associated ALI is still unclear. The study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms and immune characteristics associated with cuproptosis in sepsis-associated ALI, with implications for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.MethodsData from the GEO database was utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in sepsis-associated ALI. Gene enrichment analysis, WGCNA, CIBERSORT algorithm, and consensus clustering were employed to investigate the associations between CRGs and immune cells. A predictive model for sepsis-associated ALI was developed based on key CRGs, and its diagnostic accuracy was assessed. Finally, qPCR was employed to validate alterations in the expression of CRGs in the sepsis-associated ALI cellular model.ResultsA total of 14 CRGs were identified in sepsis-associated ALI. Strong correlations between the CRGs and immune cells were observed, and two different CRG subtypes were identified. The expression of immune-related factors in both the CRG and gene clusters exhibited similarities, suggesting a connection between the subgroups and immune cells. The prediction model effectively forecasted the incidence of sepsis-associated ALI based on the expression of CRGs. Finally, qPCR analysis confirmed that the expressions of CRGs in the sepsis-associated ALI cell model closely matched those identified through bioinformatic analyses.ConclusionThe study comprehensively evaluated the complex relationship between cuproptosis and sepsis-associated ALI. CRGs were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence, immune characteristics, and biological processes of sepsis-associated ALI. These findings provide valuable new insights into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-associated ALI.",1
"In recent years, new treatments have become available which have improved survival rates in lung cancer patients. One promising treatment option is the rapidly growing field of oral targeted therapies, which employs drugs that interfere with specific molecules involved in the growth, progression, and spread of cancer. However, these therapies can cause a variety of symptoms and adverse events that can impair quality of life. mHealth technologies may help individuals with lung cancer better track their side effects and manage medications on a day-to-day basis. However, understanding patients’ attitudes toward smart devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, and smart pill bottles, as well as their specific needs when using these devices, is critical before design and deployment studies of medication adherence can be carried out. In this study, we conducted interviews with 9 individuals with stage III-IV lung cancer at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to assess the feasibility of using such devices for managing medication and medication related side-effects. We evaluated patients’ attitudes towards the design and function of smart devices and how these devices fit into their daily life. Our results may help clinicians and researchers to co-develop effective mHealth system deployments for side effect and medication management in oncology populations.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health concern owing to its complexity, which often poses a great challenge to the development of therapeutic approaches. No single theory has yet accounted for the various risk factors leading to the pathological and clinical manifestations of dementiatype AD. Therefore, treatment options targeting various molecules involved in the pathogenesis of the disease have been unsuccessful. However, the exploration of various immunotherapeutic avenues revitalizes hope after decades of disappointment. The hallmark of a good immunotherapeutic candidate is not only to remove amyloid plaques but also to slow cognitive decline. In line with this, both active and passive immunotherapy have shown success and limitations. Recent approval of aducanumab for the treatment of AD demonstrates how close passive immunotherapy is to being successful. However, several major bottlenecks still need to be resolved. This review outlines recent successes and challenges in the pursuit of an AD vaccine.",0
"AbstractBiomaterials often have subtle properties that ultimately drive their bespoke performance. Given this nuanced structure–function behavior, the standard scientific approach of one experiment at a time or design of experiment methods is largely inefficient for the discovery of complex biomaterials. More recently, high-throughput experimentation coupled with machine learning methods has matured beyond expert users allowing scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds to access these powerful data science tools. As a result, we now have the opportunity to strategically utilize all available data from high-throughput experiments to train efficacious models and map the structure-function behavior of biomaterials for their discovery. Herein, we discuss this necessary shift to data-driven determination of structure–function properties of biomaterials as we highlight how machine learning is leveraged in identifying physicochemical cues for biomaterials in tissue engineering, gene delivery, drug delivery, protein stabilization, and antifouling materials. We also discuss data-mining approaches that are coupled with machine learning to map biomaterial functions that reduce the load on experimental approaches for faster biomaterial discovery. Ultimately, harnessing the prowess of machine learning will lead to accelerated discovery and development of optimal biomaterial designs.","Aging is associated with immunological changes that compromise response to infections and vaccines, exacerbate inflammatory diseases and can potentially mitigate tissue repair. Even so, age-related changes to the immune response to tissue damage and regenerative medicine therapies remain unknown. Here, it is characterized how aging induces changes in immunological signatures that inhibit tissue repair and therapeutic response to a clinical regenerative biological scaffold derived from extracellular matrix. Signatures of inflammation and interleukin (IL)-17 signaling increased with injury and treatment both locally and regionally in aged animals, and computational analysis uncovered age-associated senescent-T cell communication that promotes type 3 immunity in T cells. Local inhibition of type 3 immune activation using IL17-neutralizing antibodies improves healing and restores therapeutic response to the regenerative biomaterial, promoting muscle repair in older animals. These results provide insights into tissue immune dysregulation that occurs with aging that can be targeted to rejuvenate repair.",1
"OBJECTIVEImmune checkpoint-inhibitory therapeutic antibodies have shown striking activity against several types of cancers but are less effective against brain-localized malignancies, in part due to the protective effect of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The authors hypothesized that intraarterial (IA) delivery of a novel compound, NEO100, has the potential to safely and reversibly open the BBB to enable brain-targeted therapeutic activity of checkpoint-inhibitory antibodies.METHODSImmunocompetent mice with syngeneic glioblastoma or melanoma cells implanted into their brains were subjected to a single IA injection of NEO100 to open their BBB. One dose of murine anti–PD-1/PD-L1 antibody was either coinjected with NEO100 or separately injected intravenously. Brain penetration of these antibodies and levels of CD8+ T cell infiltrate into the tumor microenvironment were quantitated and animal survival was monitored.RESULTSIA NEO100 enabled the increased accumulation of checkpoint-inhibitory antibodies in the brain, along with greater numbers of T cells. In both malignancy models, a single intervention of IA NEO100 combined with antibody resulted in the long-term survival of animals. Antibody treatment in the absence of NEO100 was far less effective.CONCLUSIONSBBB opening by IA NEO100 facilitates brain tumor access by checkpoint-inhibitory antibodies and enables their therapeutic activity, along with increased levels of T-cell recruitment.","Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) has a poor prognosis.

"ObjectivesThis study aimed to compare the efficacy of local excision (LE) and intersphincteric resection (ISR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieved a significant or complete pathological response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients with stage ypT0-1ycN0 low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy who underwent LE or ISR between June 2016 and June 2021. Baseline characteristics, short-term outcomes, long-term oncological outcomes, and functional outcomes, were compared between the two groups. To reduce the selection bias, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was performed.ResultsThis study included 106 patients (LE group: n = 51, ISR group: n = 55). There were significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (P < 0.05). After IPTW, there were almost no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. The LE group showed less postoperative complications and better function outcomes compared to the ISR group. The LE group had significantly lower rates of complications (13.7% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.014). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of long-term oncological outcomes.ConclusionsFor patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer achieving significant or complete pathological response after neoadjuvant therapy, both LE and ISR present comparable oncological outcomes. Yet, LE seems to show more advantages in terms of postoperative complications and functional outcomes. These findings offer important insights for surgical decision-making, emphasizing the necessity to consider both oncological and functional outcomes in selecting the optimal surgical approach.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05454-y.","PurposeEsophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most lethal gastrointestinal malignancies. Immunotherapy is a promising treatment modality for this disease. However, broader implementation of EC immunotherapy has been discouraged because of insufficient understanding of tumor interactions with the immune system. As with other malignancies, the current research on EC focuses on deciphering the immune cell signatures within the tumor microenvironment. However, the disease-elicited immune cell profiles in the paratumoral compartments are largely unknown.MethodsWe examined the immune cell signatures in 62 tissue samples from 16 EC patients in different esophageal tissue compartments: tumor tissue, peritumoral tissue, healthy esophageal tissue, and adjacent lymph nodes. We analyzed the proportions and distribution patterns of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as their death receptor (FasR, FasR/DR3)-expressing subpopulations. The analyzed data were then compared and correlated with the patients' clinicopathological data.ResultsWe found that the FasR+ NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrated lymph nodes at the lowest levels and that the FasR+DR3+ CD4+ T cells were enhanced in tumors. The comparisons with the clinicopathological data revealed a major impact of active smoking on the reduction in paratumoral NK cells and the upregulation of FasR in tumor-infiltrating NK and CD8+ T cells. The lymph node metastatic stage, tumor stage, and Mandard grade correlated with the compartmental proportions of the evaluated immune cells.ConclusionThe novel association of the disease state with tumoral and paratumoral immune cell signatures suggests new possibilities for personalized immunotherapy for EC patients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03258-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"AbstractCancer immunotherapy is used to treat tumors by modulating the immune system. Although the anticancer efficacy of cancer immunotherapy has been evaluated prior to clinical trials, conventional in vivo animal and endpoint models inadequately replicate the intricate process of tumor elimination and reflect human‐specific immune systems. Therefore, more sophisticated models that mimic the complex tumor‐immune microenvironment must be employed to assess the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Additionally, using real‐time imaging technology, a step‐by‐step evaluation can be applied, allowing for a more precise assessment of treatment efficacy. Here, an overview of the various imaging‐based evaluation platforms recently developed for cancer immunotherapeutic applications is presented. Specifically, a fundamental technique is discussed for stably observing immune cell‐based tumor cell killing using direct imaging, a microwell that reproduces a confined space for spatial observation, a droplet assay that facilitates cell–cell interactions, and a 3D microphysiological system that reconstructs the vascular environment. Furthermore, it is suggested that future evaluation platforms pursue more human‐like immune systems.","AbstractCurrent immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT) predominantly targets T cells to harness the antitumor effects of adaptive immune system. However, the effectiveness of ICBT is reduced by immunosuppressive innate myeloid cells in tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Toll‐like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a) are often used to address this problem because they can reprogram myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor‐associated M2 macrophages, and boost dendritic cell (DC)‐based T‐cell generation; however, the systemic toxicity of TLR7/8a limits its clinical translation. Here, to address this limitation and utilize the effectiveness of TLR7/8a, this work suggests a programmed two‐step activation strategy via Antibody‐Trojan Immune Converter Conjugates (ATICC) that specifically targets myeloid cells by anti‐SIRPα followed by reactivation of transiently inactivated Trojan TLR7/8a after antibody‐mediated endocytosis. ATICC blocks the CD47‐SIRPα (“don't eat me” signal), enhances phagocytosis, reprograms M2 macrophages and MDSCs, and increases cross‐presentation by DCs, resulting in antigen‐specific CD8+ T‐cell generation in tumor‐draining lymph nodes and TME while minimizing systemic toxicity. The local or systemic administration of ATICC improves ICBT responsiveness through reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME, increased infiltration of antigen‐specific CD8+ T cells, and antibody‐dependent cellular phagocytosis. These results highlight the programmed and target immunomodulation via ATICC could enhance cancer immunotherapy with minimized systemic toxicities.",1
"Significance:Cellular senescence is a critical process underlying aging and is associated with age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Lipids are implicated in cellular senescence. Fatty acids, particularly eicosanoids, have been associated with various forms of senescence and inflammation, and the associated reactive oxygen species production has been proposed as a therapeutic target for mitigating senescence. When overactivated, calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins.Recent Advances:With a growing understanding of the importance of lipids as mediators and modulators of senescence, cPLA2 has emerged as a compelling drug target. cPLA2 overactivation plays a significant role in several pathways associated with senescence, including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.Critical Issues:Previous cPLA2 inhibitors have shown potential in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress, but the dominant hurdles in the central nervous system-targeting drug discovery are specificity and blood–brain barrier penetrance.Future Directions:With the need for more effective drugs against neurological diseases, we emphasize the significance of discovering new brain-penetrant, potent, and specific cPLA2 inhibitors. We discuss how the recently developed Virtual Synthon Hierarchical Enumeration Screening, an iterative synthon-based approach for fast structure-based virtual screening of billions of compounds, provides an efficient exploration of large chemical spaces for the discovery of brain-penetrant cPLA2 small-molecule inhibitors. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 41, 1100–1116.","Three 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) derivatives (named C4–C6) including DNJ and tegafur (TGF) were designed and synthesized, and their antiproliferative effects were investigated. C4–C6, especially C6, exerted good lipophilicity, α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and antitumor effects. Mechanism studies indicated that C6 significantly induced cell apoptosis and S-phase block and inhibited migration of HCT-116 cells. Besides, C6 induced mitochondrial damage by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, improving the accumulation of ROS, upregulating the expression of Bax, and downregulating Bcl-2. Moreover, C6 induced excessive production of ROS to trigger oxidative stress, resulting in an increase in the level of MDA and NO, a decrease in the content of GSH and SOD, and an overexpression of Nrf2. Furthermore, C6 induced DNA damage by down-regulating the expression of thymidylate synthase. These results indicated that C6 is a potential antitumor agent and kills HCT-116 cells through DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDDue to the challenging location, adult malignant brainstem glioma can not undergo aggressive surgery and is associated with a quite poor prognosis. Effective therapy regimens for this disease have not been developed. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of anlotinib, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, combined with radiotherapy in treating this group of patients. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis is an ongoing phase II, multicenter, single-arm trial investigating the safety, tolerability, and activity of anlotinib combined with radiotherapy in malignant brainstem glioma. Eligible participants include adults (18-70 years old) with newly diagnosed malignant (WHO III - IV) brainstem glioma based on histology or radiology who are radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biotherapy naïve. Patients with Karnofsky score < 40 and a life expectancy < 3 months are excluded. All participants received 54-60 Gy radiotherapy (RT,1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction, five days per week). Anlotinib (10mg, orally, daily, d1-14/3 weeks) concurrently administered with radiotherapy, then consolidatedly used until disease progression or occurrence of intolerable adverse events. The primary objective includes disease control rate (DCR) and 6-month progression-free survival rate (6m-PFS). The secondary objective includes overall survival (OS), and toxicity profile (NCT04668508). RESULTSAs of January 31, 2024, 19 participants have enrolled, all patients have completed radiotherapy. Sixteen patients who with a follow-up of 6 months or longer were included in the analysis for this report. The median age is 32 (range 18-68) years old. The median follow-up is 22.7 (range 6.0-38.3) months. Seven patients were pathologically diagnosed and nine patients were radiologically diagnosed with high-grade glioma. The DCR is 100% (Stable disease, SD: 16/16) at the end of radiotherapy and is 100% three months after radiotherapy (Partial response, PR: 2/16; SD: 14/16). The median PFS is 11.7 months, 95%CI 6.9-16.4, and the 6m-PFS and 1 year-PFS rates are 74.0% 11.2% and 36.3% 13.3%. The median OS is 18.7 months, 95%CI 10.7-34.7, the 6m-OS and 1 year-OS rates are 93.3% 6.4%and 58.3% 15.0%. No death occurred during the treatment. No ≥ grade 3 adverse events were observed up to the last follow-up (January 31, 2024) of this study. CONCLUSIONAnlotinib combined with radiotherapy is efficacious and well-tolerated and might be a treatment option for newly diagnosed malignant brain stem glioma in adults.","PurposeOur objective is to examine the independent prognostic risk factors for patients with Esophageal Cancer with Liver Metastasis (ECLM) and to develop a predictive model.MethodsIn this study, clinical data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Cox regression analysis was employed to identify independent prognostic factors and construct nomograms based on the results of multivariate regression. The predictive performance of the nomograms was assessed using several methods, including the consistency index (C-index), calibration curve, time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC), and decision curve analysis (DCA). Additionally, Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated to demonstrate the variation in overall survival between groups.ResultsA total of 1163 ECLM patients were included in the study. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that age, tumor differentiation grade, bone metastasis, therapy, and income were independently associated with overall survival (OS) in the training set. Subsequently, a prognostic nomogram was constructed based on these independent predictors. The C-index values were 0.739 and 0.715 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) values at 0.5, 1, and 2 years were all higher than 0.700. Calibration curves indicated that the nomogram accurately predicted OS. Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed moderately positive net benefits. Kaplan–Meier survival curves demonstrated significant differences in survival between high- and low-risk groups, which were divided based on the nomogram risk score.ConclusionsThe nomogram we developed for ECLM patients has demonstrated good predictive capability, allowing clinicians to accurately evaluate patient prognosis and identify those at high risk, thereby facilitating the development of personalized treatment plans.",0
"BackgroundGliomas are the most common highly aggressive primary malignant brain tumors in adults with different biological behaviors and clinically heterogeneous features. About the extremely poor prognosis of gliomas, the search for potential therapeutic modalities and targets is crucial.MethodWe extracted the anoikis-related genes (ARG) from GeneCards and obtained differentially expressed genes in normal and glioma tissues from the GSE4290 dataset to obtain intersect differentially expressed ARG in gliomas by differential analysis. KEGG and GO analyses were used to evaluate the potential pathways and molecular processes of these genes. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training cohort, we performed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and Cox regression to construct an ARG prognostic model and validated them in the TCGA testing cohort and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) validation cohort. Subsequently, we further explored the differences in clinical characteristics, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and the immune microenvironment in the high- and low-risk groups. Univariate and multifactorial regression analyses and nomogram construction were also performed. Moreover, we evaluated the expression levels of key genes via public databases, qPCR analysis and IHC staining, and further assessed the clinical prognostic value.ResultsThe regulatory model based on quantitative ARG prognostic models showed that patients in the high-risk group were associated with poorer survival prognosis, poorer clinical characteristics, and higher TMB levels. Moreover, the high-risk group had high levels of immune infiltration and upregulated immune checkpoint gene expression. The ARG prognostic model and the Nomogram showed good predictive performance. Expression and survival analysis of five prognostic ARG signatures (ETV4, HMOX1, MYC, NFE2L2, and UBE2C) showed that these genes have potential prognostic value.ConclusionOur constructed ARG prognostic risk model provides a potential therapeutic target and theoretical basis for predicting the prognosis of glioma patients and guiding individualized immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05138-7.","PurposeTumor immunotherapy has the advantages of high specificity, minimal damage to the patient’s body, and a long-lasting anti-tumor effect. However, due to the existence of immune escape phenomenon, the effect of anti-tumor immunotherapy is still poor. Therefore, a cancer vaccine that reverses tumor-associated immunosuppression is a very promising approach for research and treatment.MethodsVaccines were prepared using autologous and allogeneic tumor cells and their lysates to syngeneic tumor cell lysates as immunogens. The glioma cell proliferation, apoptosis and the secretion level of MCP-2, IFN-γ were detected to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment against glioma in vitro. In addition, a rat glioma model was established to investigate the anti-tumor effect in vivo, and evaluated its efficacy by observing the changes of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, NK cells, and the level of IL-2 and IL-10 in peripheral blood before and after treatment.ResultsThe C6 + 9L glioma cell lysate vaccine (C6 + 9L-CL) not only inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells and promoted their apoptosis in vitro, but also significantly inhibited the tumor growth in vivo and improved the survival time of rats. In addition, the C6 + 9L-CL vaccine enhanced the anti-tumor immune response by promoting the secretion of T cell chemokines MCP-2, IFN-γ and IL-2, and by stimulating the proliferation of T cells and NK cells in peripheral blood and glioma tissues.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate the inhibitory effect of molecular mimic vaccines on glioma and provided a theoretical basis for molecular mimic hybrid vaccines as a potential therapeutic approach.",1
"AbstractDrug resistance remains a major obstacle in cancer treatment, leading to treatment failures and high mortality rates. Despite advancements in therapies, overcoming resistance requires a deeper understanding of its mechanisms. This review highlights CDK2's pivotal role in both intrinsic and acquired resistance, and its potential as a therapeutic target. Cyclin E upregulation, which partners with CDK2, is linked to poor prognosis and resistance across various cancers. Specifically, amplifications of CCNE1/CCNE2 are associated with resistance to targeted therapies, immunotherapy, endocrine therapies and chemo/radiotherapy. Given CDK2's involvement in resistance mechanisms, investigating its role presents promising opportunities for developing novel strategies to combat resistance and improve treatment outcomes.","Chemotherapy holds a prominent position in contemporary cancer treatment modalities; however, poor water solubility, rapid clearance, and unintended side effects remain significant challenges. To mitigate these issues, various nanoparticle-based delivery systems have been devised to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of chemotherapeutic drugs. While biocompatible, most of these drug delivery systems include materials that are foreign to the human body. Consequently, it is critical for these materials to be effectively removed from the body to prevent potential toxicity. In this study, we introduce a nanoparticle-based system that utilizes only hemin, which is naturally found in the body, as an amphiphilic coating agent to facilitate the solubilization of hydrophobic drugs. Camptothecin (CPT), Paclitaxel (PTX), and Sorafenib (SOR) were each formulated into stable hemin-coated nanoparticles (HeminNPs). We demonstrate that hemin-coated CPT nanoparticles exhibit an improved safety profile and therapeutic efficacy, compared with the administration of CPT alone, in a murine tumor model of triple-negative breast cancer. Consequently, utilizing HeminNPs demonstrates potential in reducing off-target toxicity and amplifying the therapeutic effectiveness of cancer treatments, which may ultimately contribute to improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients.",1
"AbstractFor COVAIL recipients of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Sanofi booster vaccine, neutralizing antibody titers were assessed as a correlate of risk (CoR) of COVID-19. Peak and exposure-proximal titers were inverse CoRs with covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) 0.30 (0.11, 0.78) and 0.25 (0.07, 0.85) per 10-fold increase in weighted average titer.","Currently, cancer immunotherapy efficacy is measured by endpoints, such as progression-free survival and overall survival, that are unable to reflect authentic responses to checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials. Second progression-free survival, however, could be an ideal surrogate endpoint due to its easy measurability, correlation with overall survival, and ability to evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapies. This commentary summarizes second progression-free survival data from clinical trials investigating first-line anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors. We speculate that first-line immunotherapies exert a positive influence on the efficacy of later therapies in patients with a few cancer types, though additional research is urgently warranted.",0
"AbstractBackgroundMSA-2, as an oral molecule for activating STING signaling pathway to cure the tumor entering clinical trials. The toxicity of MSA-2 has aroused wide concern, especially the reproductive toxicity can not be ignored.ObjectivesWe synthesized the STING agonist (MSA-2) and its derivative manganese-MSA-2 (MSA-2-Mn) and investigated the reproductive toxicity.MethodsWe evaluated the reproductive effects of MSA-2 and MSA-2-Mn in female mice under the administration alone and on the reproductive system of male mice in the presence or absence of combined radiation.ResultsResults suggested that MSA-2 and MSA-2-Mn have negligible reproductive toxicity in healthy adults. Conclusions: This provides new ideas to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, as well as favorable evidence for future systemic dosing in patients of reproductive age and clinical trials of immunotherapy.","Frizzled receptors (FZDs) are key contributors intrinsic to the Wnt signaling pathway, activation of FZDs triggering the Wnt signaling cascade is frequently observed in human tumors and intimately associated with an aggressive carcinoma phenotype. It has been shown that the abnormal expression of FZD receptors contributes to the manifestation of malignant characteristics in human tumors such as enhanced cell proliferation, metastasis, chemotherapy resistance as well as the acquisition of cancer stemness. Given the essential roles of FZD receptors in the Wnt signaling in human tumors, this review aims to consolidate the prevailing knowledge on the specific status of FZD receptors (FZD1–10) and elucidate their respective functions in tumor progression. Furthermore, we delineate the structural basis for binding of FZD and its co-receptors to Wnt, and provide a better theoretical foundation for subsequent studies on related mechanisms. Finally, we describe the existing biological classes of small molecule-based FZD inhibitors in detail in the hope that they can provide useful assistance for design and development of novel drug candidates targeted FZDs.",0
"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pCRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the accepted standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The purpose of pCRT is to prevent the spread of viable tumor cells within the local area during surgical procedures. Additionally, pCRT can facilitate the resection of locally advanced tumors that are otherwise challenging to remove, thereby enabling a radical resection. Although a pathologic complete response is observed in fewer than 20% of patients, the reasons for the variability in tumor response to pCRT are not fully understood. Several techniques have been researched with the aim of improving the tumor response to pCRT. These techniques include intensifying or combining chemotherapy, either simultaneously or sequentially, increasing radiation dose, modifying radiation mode or schedule, adjusting the interval between radiation and surgery, and incorporating multiple agents to increase the efficacy of pCRT. This review discusses various strategies that may improve tumor response outcomes following pCRT.","IntoductionBladder cancer is the second most common urinary tract cancer. Above 70% of the occurrence of bladder cancer is superficial (pTis, pTa, and pT1), non-muscle invasive tumor (NMIBC), and the incidence of invasive disease is occasional. Treatments for NMIBC consist of transurethral resection (TUR) and subsequently intravesical immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), intending to prevent tumor progression and decrease recurrence. However, 20–30% of these tumors have progression, and 70% have a recurrence after exclusive TUR treatment. The immunomodulator of biological response, OncoTherad®, is an attractive potential to revolutionize cancer therapy. In our previous studies with mice, the results showed that treatment with OncoTherad® reduced 100% of tumor progression in NMIBC through the activation of Toll-Like Receptors’ non-canonical pathway.Materials and Methods In the present study, 36 female C57Bl/6J mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 6/group): Control, Cancer, Cancer + BCG, Cancer + OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1), Cancer + P14-16 and Cancer + CFI-1. NMIBC was chemically induced and the treatments were followed for 6 weeks. A week after the last dose of treatment, animals were euthanized, the bladder was collected and routinely processed for immunohistochemical analyses of RANK, RANKL, FOXP3, and PD-1/PD-L1, such as PD-1/PD-L1 western blotting.ConclusionThe immunohistochemical results showed that OncoTherad® reduced RANK and RANKL immunoreactivities compared to the cancer group, which indicates a good prognosis. Immunohistochemical and western blotting analyses confirmed that OncoTherad® modulated PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint.",0
"Eosinophils are often encountered in the stroma and peritumoral microenvironment of squamous cell carcinomas. Because eosinophils are readily identified on routine hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, researchers have explored multiple ways in which identifying the extent of eosinophil infiltration on routine biopsy and excisional specimens might provide diagnostic and prognostic information. We review the literature on this evolving topic.","PurposeProcalcitonin (PCT) is an inflammatory marker elevated in bacteremia and bacterial pneumonia. We aimed to assess the real-world diagnostic accuracy of PCT in hospitalized patients with malignancy.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 715 patients with cancer who had PCT measured during 750 admissions was analyzed. Diagnosis of bacteremia was determined using blood culture data. Diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was based on radiographic infiltrate and/or sputum culture. PCT’s performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and specificity.ResultsPatients had bacteremia, bacterial pneumonia, or both during 210 admissions (28%). PCT elevation above 0.5 ng/mL was significantly associated with diagnosed infection in the overall population (p < 0.0001) and in subgroups with solid tumor malignancies (p < 0.0001) and hematologic malignancies (p = 0.008). PCT was associated with infectious status in patients with any metastases, but not those with primary lung cancer, lung metastases, neuroendocrine tumors, febrile neutropenia, or history of bone marrow transplant (BMT). The area under the ROC curve for PCT in the overall population was 0.655. An ideal cutoff of 0.21 ng/mL led to a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 59%. At cutoffs of 0.5 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, PCT’s sensitivity was 39% and 94%, while specificity was 79% and 17%, respectively.ConclusionIn this large cohort of hospitalized oncology patients, PCT elevation was associated with diagnosed bacteremia and/or bacterial pneumonia. However, specificity was limited, and PCT elevation was not associated with diagnosed infection in some subpopulations. While PCT may have some diagnostic utility for hospitalized oncology patients, values must be interpreted cautiously and considering clinical context.",1
"The tumor-associated antigen MUC1 is an attractive target for immunotherapy, however, its weak immunogenicity limits the induction of antitumor immune responses. To overcome this limitation, in this study, MUC1 glycopeptide was covalently linked with a diphtheria toxin-derived T-helper epitope (DT331–345). Subsequently, the resulting DT-MUC1 glycopeptide was physically mixed with natural killer T cell agonist αGalCer to explore their immunomodulatory synergy. Biological results demonstrated that compared to MUC1+αGalCer and DT-MUC1 groups, the specific IgG antibody titer of DT-MUC1+αGalCer group increased by 189- and 3-fold, respectively, indicating that the diphtheria toxin-derived T-helper epitope synergistically enhanced MUC1 immunogenicity with αGalCer. Moreover, the DT-MUC1+αGalCer vaccine induced potent cellular immune responses and significantly inhibited the growth of B16-MUC1 tumors in vivo. Furthermore, it was found that the anti-MUC1 IgG antibody titer induced by DT-MUC1+αGalCer was equivalent to that induced by palmitoylated DT-MUC1+αGalCer (P1-DT-MUC1+αGalCer) and significantly higher than that induced by doubly palmitoylated DT-MUC1+αGalCer (P2-DT-MUC1+αGalCer), suggesting that the easily synthesized DT-MUC1 may not require lipid chain modification and already possess good amphiphilicity. This is the first time that a diphtheria toxin-derived helper T-helper epitope was covalently linked to a glycopeptide antigen to enhance its immunogenicity, and this study may provide an effective vaccine design strategy for MUC1-targeted antitumor vaccines and offer novel insights into the design of fully synthetic peptide vaccines.","Infants are vulnerable to infections due to a limited ability to mount a humoral immune response and their tolerogenic immune phenotype, which has impeded the success of newborn vaccination. Transplacental transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from mother to fetus provides crucial protection in the first weeks of life, and maternal immunization has recently been implemented as a public health strategy to protect newborns against serious infections. Despite their early success, current maternal vaccines do not provide comparable protection across pregnancies with varying gestational length, placental, and maternal immune features, nor do they account for the dynamic interplay between the maternal immune response and placental transfer. Moreover, progress toward the rational design of maternal vaccines has been hindered by inadequacies of existing experimental models and safety challenges of investigating longitudinal dynamics of IgG transfer in pregnant humans. Alternatively, in silico mechanistic models are a logical framework to disentangle the processes regulating placental antibody transfer. This review synthesizes current literature through a mechanistic modeling lens to identify placental and maternal regulators of antibody transfer, their clinical covariates, and knowledge gaps to guide future research. We also describe opportunities to employ integrated modeling and experimental approaches toward the rational design of vaccines against existing and emerging neonatal pathogen threats.",0
"Current interventions for oral/dental diseases heavily rely on operative/surgical procedures, while the discovery of novel drug targets may enable access to noninvasive pharmacotherapy. Therefore, this study aims to leverage large-scale data and Mendelian randomization (MR) techniques, utilizing genetic variants as instruments, to identify potential therapeutic targets for oral and dental diseases supported by genetic evidence. By intersecting 4,302 druggable genes with expression quantitative trait loci from 31,684 blood samples, we identified 2,580 druggable targets as exposures. Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with dental disease/symptom traits were collected from FinnGen R9, the Gene–Lifestyle Interactions in Dental Endpoints consortium, and the UK Biobank to serve as outcomes for both discovery and replication purposes. Through MR analysis, we identified 43 druggable targets for various dental disease/symptom traits. To evaluate the viability of these targets, we replicated the analysis using circulating protein quantitative trait loci as exposures. Additionally, we conducted sensitivity, colocalization, Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation, protein–protein interaction analyses, and validated dental trait–associated druggable gene expression in animal models. Among these targets, IL12RB1 (odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–1.01) and TNF (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99) exhibited therapeutic promise for oral ulcers, whereas CXCL10 (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.91) was for periodontitis. Through a rigorous quality control and validation pipeline, our study yields compelling evidence for these druggable targets, which may enhance the clinical prognosis by developing novel drugs or repurposing existing ones.","Real-time monitoring of dynamic biological processes in the body is critical to understanding disease progression and treatment response. This data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy. However, current clinical imaging modalities lack the molecular contrast, resolution, and chronic usability for rapid and accurate response assessments. Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a 2.5×5 mm2 CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue. The sensor operates wirelessly via ultrasound (US) at 5 cm depth in oil, harvesting energy with 221 mW/cm2 incident US power density (31% of FDA limits) and backscattering data at 13 kbps with a bit error rate <10−6. In-situ fluorescence excitation is provided by microlaser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical frontend combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate provides >6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A 36×40-pixel array captures images with <125μm resolution. We demonstrate wireless, dual-color fluorescence imaging of both effector and suppressor immune cells in ex vivo mouse tumor samples with and without immunotherapy. These results show promise for providing rapid insight into therapeutic response and resistance, guiding personalized medicine.",1
"PurposeEmerging evidence suggests that pyroptosis plays an essential role in the development and progression of multiple cancers. However, the role of pyroptosis remains elusive in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).MethodsThe expression profile data of DLBCL and normal samples of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) were analyzed, and the clinical characteristics of DLBCL patients were further investigated. A prognostic model was established using LASSO-Cox regression analysis. The expression of these PRGs was validated by qRT-PCR in DLBCL cell lines. Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry were utilized to explore the impact of pyroptosis inhibitor (disulfiram, DSF) combined with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor (BMS1166) on DLBCL cell proliferation.ResultsMost PRGs were dysregulated in DLBCL samples and associated with overall survival (OS). Six PRGs were selected to construct a prognostic risk score model. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that CASP8, CASP9, NLRP1, NLRP6, and TIRAP are downregulated, while SCAF11 was significantly upregulated in DLBCL cell lines. This prognostic model divided DLBCL patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited lower mortality and longer OS than those in the high-risk group. The ROC curve and nomogram demonstrated this model's excellent predictive performance. GO and KEGG enrichment indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between subgroups were associated with cellular protein modification processes and JAK-STAT signaling pathway regulation. Moreover, the risk score was correlated with the immune profile. Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry further validated the synergistic anti-tumor effects of DSF and BMS1166 on DLBCL cells.ConclusionIn summary, we developed a comprehensive prognostic model based on PRGs characteristics, which accurately predicted the prognosis of DLBCL patients. Pyroptosis-targeting coupled with immunotherapies would be a promising therapeutic strategy for DLBCL.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05018-0.","AbstractBackgroundSex differences in adult diffuse glioma (ADG) are well established clinically, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Here, we aim to reveal molecular features and cellular compositions unique to each sex in ADG to comprehend the role of sex in disease etiology.MethodsWe quantified sex differences in the transcriptome of ADG using multiple independent glioma patient datasets. Next, we delved into the single-cell landscape to examine sex differences in gene expression and cellular composition. To explore how sex influences disease progression, we analyzed paired samples from primary and recurrent ADG cases, aiming to identify sex-specific differences in molecular and cellular features.ResultsOur analysis revealed that mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes and the tumor microenvironment emerged as primary influencers of sex-differential molecular enrichments. In IDHwt tumors, genes in the neuronal signaling pathway are found to be enriched in male tumors, while genes in hypoxia and inflammatory response pathways are enriched in female tumors. This pattern was reversed in IDHmut gliomas. We hypothesized that these distinctions could be attributed to heterogeneous cellular composition between sexes. Using single-cell data, we observed distinctive patterns of sex differences in cell states, cell composition, and cell–cell interaction in IDHwt and IDHmut tumors separately. Further, by comparing molecular changes in paired primary and recurrent ADG samples, we identified sex-specific differences in molecular characteristics and cellular compositions of recurrent tumors.ConclusionsOur results provide a comprehensive multilevel characterization of sex differences in ADG; such findings provide novel insights into glioma disease progression in each sex.",0
"AbstractThe post COVID-19 pandemic era has emerged with more efficient vaccines, all based on genetic materials. However, to expand the use of nucleic components as vaccines, a new generation of nanosystems particularly constructed to increase RNA/DNA stability, half-life and facilitate administration are still required. This review highlights novel developments in mRNA and pDNA vaccines formulated into nanostructures exclusively composed by biopolymeric materials. Recent advances suggest that a new generation of vaccines may arise by adapting the structural features of biopolymers with the effectiveness of nucleic acids. The advantages offered by biopolymers, such as increased stability and targeting ability may cause a revolution in the immunization field for offering promptly adaptable and effective formulations for worldwide distribution.","Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a type of RNA that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where it is translated into proteins. mRNA has emerged as a powerful platform for development of new types of medicine, especially after the clinical approval of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Chemical modification and nanoparticle delivery have contributed to this success significantly by improving mRNA stability, reducing its immunogenicity, protecting it from enzymatic degradation, and enhancing cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Recently, substantial progresses have been made in new modification chemistries, sequence design, and structural engineering to generate more stable and efficient next-generation mRNAs. These innovations could further facilitate the clinical translation of mRNA therapies and vaccines. Given that numerous review articles have been published on mRNA nanoparticle delivery and biomedical applications over the last few years, we herein focus on overviewing recent advances in mRNA chemical modification, mRNA sequence optimization, and mRNA engineering (for example, circular RNA and multitailed mRNA), with the aim of providing new perspectives on the development of more effective and safer mRNA medicines.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies with a dismal survival rate. Few strategies can effectively prevent the occurrence of HCC. Although immunotherapy has significantly improved HCC-related survival in recent years, this systemic therapy is very expensive and lays a heavy burden on most HCC patients. Aspirin, which is currently one of the most widely used medications in analgesic and cardiovascular diseases, is reported to have anti-tumor effects on HCC. Most importantly, long-term administration of low-dose aspirin does not significantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Owing to its cost-effectiveness and wide use, aspirin can be easily applied as an HCC treatment and is affordable for a wide range of patients. Therefore, deeper understanding and more attention are needed to extend the frontline of aspirin's preventive and therapeutic potential into cancer research and management. In this review, we discuss the preventive effect of aspirin on HCC in the context of different etiological factors, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcohol-associated liver disease. The therapeutic role of aspirin in resectable or unresectable HCC management is also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of aspirin on HCC are fully reviewed and discussed in the following two aspects: the effect of aspirin on multi-oncogenic signaling pathways in HCC (for example, AMPK, Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB) and aspirin-mediated immunometabolic responses in liver diseases. These findings indicate aspirin is a promising agent for populations at risk and HCC patients to prevent or treat HCC.","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification. M6A RNA methylation is reversible: m6A is installed by “writers”, removed by “erasers”, and recognized by “readers”. Readers are executors to regulate RNA metabolism by recognizing specific m6A sites, including RNA splicing, export, translation and decay. YTHDF2 is the first identified m6A reader protein. YTHDF2 interacts with m6A-containing transcripts to accelerate the degradation process and regulate various biological processes, such as viral infection, stem cell development and cancer progression. Although there are some reviews about m6A modification in physiological and pathological processes, few reviews focus on roles of YTHDF2 in cancers to date. Therefore, in this review, we attempted to systematically summarize m6A reader protein YTHDF2: its structure, mechanisms in regulating RNA metabolism, roles in cancer progression and potential application for cancer treatment, which might inspire new ideas for m6A research in cancers and provide novel insights into cancer treatment.",1
"BACKGROUND & AIMS:Single-agent anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors convey outstanding clinical benefits in a small fraction (w20%) of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) but the molecular mechanisms determining response are unknown. To fill this gap, we herein analyze the molecular and immune traits of aHCC in patients treated with anti-PD1.METHODS:Overall, 111 tumor samples from patients with aHCC were obtained from 13 centers before systemic therapies. We performed molecular analysis and immune deconvolution using whole-genome expression data (n = 83), mutational analysis (n = 72), and histologic evaluation with an endpoint of objective response.RESULTS:Among 83 patients with transcriptomic data, 28 were treated in frontline, whereas 55 patients were treated after tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) either in second or third line. Responders treated in frontline showed upregulated interferon-γ signaling and major histocompatibility complex II–related antigen presentation. We generated an 11-gene signature (IFNAP), capturing these molecular features, which predicts response and survival in patients treated with anti-PD1 in frontline. The signature was validated in a separate cohort of aHCC and >240 patients with other solid cancer types where it also predicted response and survival. Of note, the same signature was unable to predict response in archival tissue of patients treated with frontline TKIs, highlighting the need for fresh biopsies before immunotherapy.CONCLUSION:Interferon signaling and major histocompatibility complex–related genes are key molecular features of HCCs responding to anti-PD1. A novel 11-gene signature predicts response in frontline aHCC, but not in patients pretreated with TKIs. These results must be confirmed in prospective studies and highlights the need for biopsies before immunotherapy to identify biomarkers of response.","The SWI/SNF complex, also known as the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) complex, represents a critical regulator of chromatin remodeling mechanisms in mammals. It is alternatively referred to as mSWI/SNF and has been suggested to be imbalanced in human disease compared with human health. Three types of BAF assemblies associated with it have been described, including  canonical BAF (cBAF),  polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), and  non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complexes. Each of these BAF assemblies plays a role, either functional or dysfunctional, in governing gene expression patterns, cellular processes, epigenetic mechanisms, and biological processes. Recent evidence increasingly links the dysregulation of mSWI/SNF complexes to various human non-malignant lung chronic disorders and lung malignant diseases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive general state-of-the-art and a profound examination of the current understanding of mSWI/SNF assembly processes, as well as the structural and functional organization of mSWI/SNF complexes and their subunits. In addition, it explores their intricate functional connections with potentially dysregulated transcription factors, placing particular emphasis on molecular and cellular pathogenic processes in lung diseases. These processes are reflected in human epigenome aberrations that impact clinical and therapeutic levels, suggesting novel perspectives on the diagnosis and molecular therapies for human respiratory diseases.",0
"Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) serves a key immunosuppressive role as a negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. HPK1 loss-of-function is associated with augmentation of immune function and has demonstrated synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in syngeneic mouse cancer models. These data offer compelling evidence for the use of selective small molecule inhibitors of HPK1 in cancer immunotherapy. We identified a novel series of isoquinoline HPK1 inhibitors through fragment-based screening that displayed promising levels of biochemical potency and activity in functional cell-based assays. We used structure-based drug design to introduce key selectivity elements while simultaneously addressing pharmacokinetic liabilities. These efforts culminated in a molecule demonstrating subnanomolar biochemical inhibition of HPK1 and strong in vitro augmentation of TCR signaling in primary human T-cells. Further profiling of this molecule revealed excellent kinase selectivity (347/356 kinases <50% inhibition @ 0.1 μM), a favorable in vitro safety profile, and good projected human pharmacokinetics.","PurposeThe regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subpopulation of lymphocytes that suppress the immune responses. The prognostic value of Tregs in lymphoma patients remains controversial. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the role of Tregs in the prognosis of lymphoma patients.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to obtain eligible studies that evaluated the prognostic factor of Tregs for lymphoma patients. Hazards ratios (HRs) with the matching 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were merged to estimate the prognostic value of Tregs.ResultsWe finally retrieved 23 eligible studies, including a total of 2269 patients. The overall pooled analysis on all types of lymphomas showed that Tregs had a significantly positive association with prolonged overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.633, 95% CI 0.528–0.758) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.451, 95% CI 0.261–0.779). Subgroup analysis indicated that high Tregs were significantly correlated with longer OS in Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and natural killer/T cell lymphoma. However, there was no significant association of Tregs with T cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.ConclusionsIncreased Tregs indicates a better prognosis for patients with lymphoma. Tregs could be used as a valuable prognostic biomarker of lymphoma patients.",0
"AbstractMelanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be challenging to treat, especially in advanced stages. Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment modalities for melanoma, but its efficacy can be limited due to the radioresistance of melanoma cells. Recently, there has been growing interest in using high-Z metal nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy for melanoma. This review provides an overview of the current state of radiotherapy for melanoma and discusses the physical and biological mechanisms of radiosensitization through high-Z metal NPs. Additionally, it summarizes the latest research on using high-Z metal NPs to sensitize melanoma cells to radiation, both in vitro and in vivo. By examining the available evidence, this review aims to shed light on the potential of high-Z metal NPs in improving radiotherapy outcomes for patients with melanoma.","ABSTRACTGlioblastoma (GBM), a highly invasive type of brain tumor located within the central nervous system, manifests a median survival time of merely 14.6 months. Radiotherapy kills tumor cells through focused high-energy radiation and has become a crucial treatment strategy for GBM, especially in cases where surgical resection is not viable. However, the presence of radioresistant tumor cells limits its clinical effectiveness. Radioresistance is a key factor of treatment failure, prompting the development of various therapeutic strategies to overcome this challenge. With the rapid development of nanomedicine, nanoradiosensitizers provide a novel approach to enhancing the effectiveness of radiotherapy. In this review, we discuss the reasons behind GBM radio-resistance and the mechanisms of radiotherapy sensitization. Then we summarize the primary types of nanoradiosensitizers and recent progress in their application for the radiosensitization of GBM. Finally, we elucidate the factors influencing their practical implementation, along with the challenges and promising prospects associated with multifunctional nanoradiosensitizers.",1
"Tumor progression is accompanied by fibrosis, a condition of excessive extracellular matrix accumulation, which is associated with diminished antitumor immune infiltration. Here we demonstrate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) respond to the stiffened fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) by initiating a collagen biosynthesis program directed by transforming growth factor-β. A collateral effect of this programming is an untenable metabolic milieu for productive CD8+ T cell antitumor responses, as collagen-synthesizing macrophages consume environmental arginine, synthesize proline and secrete ornithine that compromises CD8+ T cell function in female breast cancer. Thus, a stiff and fibrotic TME may impede antitumor immunity not only by direct physical exclusion of CD8+ T cells but also through secondary effects of a mechano-metabolic programming of TAMs, which creates an inhospitable metabolic milieu for CD8+ T cells to respond to anticancer immunotherapies.","ObjectiveTo compare the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) combined with intravesical chemotherapy (IVC) against intravesical BCG immunotherapy in high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT).Materials and methods130 patients with high-risk NMIBC who had underwent TURBT were divided into two groups, of which IAC + IVC group received four courses of IAC (cisplatin and epirubicin) combined with IVC (epirubicin or pirarubicin) after surgery and BCG group received intravesical BCG immunotherapy. Recurrence rate and progression rate were assessed by Chi-square test, while recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method.ResultsIn this study, the recurrence rate was 27.9% (12/43) in IAC + IVC group and 26.4% (14/53) in BCG group, while progression rate was 9.3% (4/43) in IAC + IVC group and 9.4% (5/53) in BCG group. Both of the recurrence and progression rate did not show a significant difference. In the Kaplan–Meier plot, no difference was found with respect to recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival. Moreover, 46.5% (20/43) patients suffered from adverse events of IAC and 83.1% (49/59) patients suffered from adverse events associated with BCG, of which 6 patients discontinued treatment due to serious adverse events of BCG. Univariate analysis suggested that only recurrent tumor could be an independent risk factor related to recurrence.ConclusionsIAC combined with IVC used in high-risk NMIBC could reduce the recurrence and progression as effective as BCG instillation with lower adverse events.",0
"PurposeNeoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection is one of the preferred treatment option for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) factor exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutations, the use of MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed high efficiency and reduced toxicity compared with first-line standard chemotherapy. However, it is unknown whether preoperative induction targeted therapy of MET-TKIs is feasible and safe.MethodsHere, we reported 3 cases of locally advanced unresectable NSCLC with METex14 mutations receiving induction therapy of MET-TKI savolitinib as first-line therapy or second-line therapy when they experienced disease progression after preoperative chemotherapy.ResultsAll these 3 patients achieved significant tumor size shrinkage and their unresectable tumors became resectable after the treatment of savolitinib. No serious adverse events were observed during the treatment. They recovered well postoperatively, and no significant events were identified.ConclusionsPreoperative induction treatment with MET-TKI savolitinib showed its safety and effectiveness and may be an alternative option for neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC patients with METex14 mutations.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) significantly burdens global healthcare systems given limited treatment options to delay or stop disease progression. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, an immunotherapeutic approach that has produced remarkably effective responses in cancer, offers a potential avenue for the treatment of AD. Here, we discuss three significant challenges of adapting CAR-T cell therapy for AD: (i) identifying a suitable antigen target; (ii) limited permeability of the blood–brain barrier; and (iii) long-term persistence and durability of manufactured CAR-T cell products. Potential strategies to overcome these hurdles provide an attractive opportunity to revolutionize the treatment for AD and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders.",0
"BackgroundIn the literature, men are often described as unwilling to use healthcare services, whereas women as frequent users. We conducted a systematic literature review to examine the gender differences in healthcare utilisation of lung cancer patients. Our aim was to synthesise evidence to assess whether men and women utilise cancer diagnosis and treatments differently.MethodsThe databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO Host, Ovid nursing, and Cochrane was systematically searched. We used pre-defined eligibility criteria to identify peer-reviewed published literature that reported healthcare use of lung cancer patients. Two reviewers independently screened the title, abstract, full texts and retrieved relevant data.ResultsA total of 42 studies met the eligibility criteria from 1356 potential studies. In these studies, the most commonly measured healthcare utilisation is surgery (n = 19), followed by chemotherapy (n = 13). All the studies were from developed countries and had a higher percentage of male participants. Substantial evidence of heterogeneity in the use of treatments by gender were found. In relation to diagnosis interval and stage of cancer diagnosis, it was found that women had longer diagnostic intervals. Nonetheless, women tend to get diagnosed at an earlier stage. Furthermore, women had a higher probability of using inpatient cancer-care services and surgical treatments. Conversely, men had greater risks of readmission after surgery and longer length of stay. Lastly, there were no significant gender differences in the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy.ConclusionThis study synthesised evidence of disparities in the use of lung cancer treatments based on gender in developed countries, with no evidence available from least-developed and developing countries. Further studies are required to understand this gender-specific inequality and to design interventions to improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03197-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","ABSTRACTAimsTo investigate mechanism of lncRNA SNHG12 induced macrophage-myofibroblast transition (MMT) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodCAFs EVs were isolated from human NSCLC tissue and adjacent cancerous tissue (n = 3), and their morphology and particle size were evaluated.

"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common cancer of the biliary tract, characterized by a very poor prognosis when diagnosed at advanced stages due to its aggressive behavior and limited therapeutic options. Early detection at a curable stage remains challenging because patients rarely exhibit symptoms; indeed, most GBCs are discovered incidentally following cholecystectomies for symptomatic gallbladder stones. Longstanding chronic inflammation is an important driver of GBC, regardless of the lithiasic or non-lithiasic origin. Advances in omics technologies have provided a deeper understanding of GBC pathogenesis, uncovering mechanisms associated with inflammation-driven tumour initiation and progression. Surgical resection is the only treatment with curative intent for GBC but very few cases are suitable for resection and most adjuvant therapy has a very low response rate. Several unmet clinical needs need to be addressed to improve GBC management, including discovery and validation of reliable biomarkers for screening, therapy selection and prognosis. Standardization of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesion nomenclature, as well as surgical specimen processing and sampling, now provides reproducible and comparable research data that provide a basis for identifying and implementing early detection strategies and improving drug discovery. Advances in the understanding of next-generation sequencing, multidisciplinary care for GBC, neoadjuvant and adjuvant strategies, and novel systemic therapies including chemotherapy and immunotherapies are gradually changing the treatment paradigm and prognosis of this recalcitrant cancer.","PurposeRecent studies have revealed that primary tumor resection (PTR) surgery could improve prognosis in some solid tumors. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether patients with stage IVB cervical carcinoma can benefit from PTR surgery and who can benefit.MethodsWe extracted and obtained data on patients with stage IVB cervical carcinoma from the SEER database from 2010 to 2017 and classified them into two groups: the surgery and the non-surgery group. The overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of the two groups were compared before and after propensity score matching (PSM). The independent prognostic variables were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Then, the model was established to select the optimal patients to receive PTR surgery using multivariate logistic regression.ResultsAfter PSM, the study included 476 cervical carcinoma (stage IVB) patients, of whom 238 underwent PTR surgery. Compared to the non-surgery group, the surgery group’s median OS and median CSS were both longer (median OS: 27 months vs. 13 months, P < 0.001; median CSS: 52 months vs. 21 months, P < 0.001). The model showed no organ metastasis, adenocarcinoma, G1/2, and chemotherapy were more supportive of performing PTR surgery. The calibration curves and DCA showed that the model had high predictive accuracy and excellent clinical applicability. Finally, the “surgery benefit” group had the OS that was approximately four times better than “surgery non-benefit” group.ConclusionPTR surgery can potentially improve the prognosis of patients with cervical carcinoma at stage IVB. The model could probably select optimal candidates and provide a new perspective on individualized treatment.",0
"Background and aimDanggui Buxue Decoction (DBD) has been applied to alleviate chronic heart failure (CHF) in clinics, however, its mechanism is still unclear. This study investigates the potential action mechanism of DBD for rats with CHF combined with liver injury.Experimental procedureFor this purpose, this study established a CHF rat model. The change of proteins in myocardial tissues was identified by proteomics and then further verified using western blotting. Additionally, metabolomics revealed the metabolic pathways associated with liver injury in CHF rats.Results and conclusionAnimal studies demonstrated that DBD could relieve CHF as it significantly reduced serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in CHF rats, and promoted the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), cytochrome oxidase (COX), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in myocardial tissues. Myocardial proteomics analysis revealed that DBD improved myocardial mitochondria and peroxisomes function by regulating the expression of proteins associated with energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Western blotting confirmed that DBD upregulated the expression of proteins in the adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 α)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPAR β) signaling pathway, which also proved the efficacy of DBD in alleviating CHF in rats. Hepatic metabolomics analysis showed that DBD could restore the damaged liver function of CHF rats via metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of lipid, vitamin, and amino acids. In conclusion, this study unveiled a novel action mechanism of DBD in the treating ISO-induced CHF and liver injury based on proteomics and metabolomics. These results lay a scientific basis for the widespread application of DBD in the cardiovascular field.","Despite significant advancement in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of breast carcinoma, the prognosis remains dismal. Recently, with advances in its understanding, various immune system-based management strategies have been developed. CTLA-4 suppresses lymphocyte reactivity, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2 receptor expression and triggers cell cycle arrest. PD-L1 inhibits the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibits release of cytokines. Hence, we planned to evaluate the immunoexpression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in invasive ductal carcinoma breast and seek correlation between their immunopositivity and the clinicopathological parameters. This was a retrospective study conducted on archival material of 50 cases of breast carcinoma tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological details were recorded. All cases were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Cytoplasmic expression of CTLA-4 and membranous expression of PD-L1 were considered positive and staining intensity was recorded as mild, moderate, and intense. Data was recorded and analyzed. Immunopositivity for CTLA-4 was seen in 92% of cases of breast carcinoma. CTLA-4 staining intensity showed significant association with TNM staging of breast carcinomas (p = 0.036). Age group of the breast carcinoma cases showed a statistically significant correlation with PD-L1 immunoexpression (p = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between all other clinicopathological characteristics and CTLA-4 or PD-L1 immunostaining. Our study shows that CTLA-4 is a more important immune checkpoint regulator in breast carcinomas in comparison to PD-L1. Thus, anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy might prove to be of immense help in the treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma breast showing overexpression of CTLA-4.",0
"PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.","ObjectiveImmunogenic cell death (ICD) has emerged as a promising strategy to activate the adaptive immune response, modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhance the efficacy of immune therapy. However, the relationship between ICD and TME reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood.MethodsTranscriptional profiles and clinical spectrum of 486 HCC patients were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. We utilized consensus clustering analysis to construct two distinct molecular subtypes and established an ICD-based scoring system (named ICD score) via WGCNA and LASSO Cox regression to predict the prognosis of the HCC cohort. Then we employed CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE methods to analyze the immune landscape of ICD score in HCC. Subsequently, the immunophenoscore (IPS) and tumor immune dysfunction and rejection (TIDE) analyses were performed to determine whether the ICD score could influence the immune therapeutic effect. Based on the ICD scoring system, a novel nomogram was generated to provide a numerical probability of HCC patients’ overall survival (OS).ResultsWe identified two independent ICD clusters (cluster A/B), and cluster B possessed a worse prognosis and higher immune cell infiltration. Using ICD scoring system, the HCC patients were divided into high- and low-ICD-score groups. Through integrative analyses, the high-ICD cohort owned advanced TNM stage, high pathologic grade and increased suppressive immune cell enrichment. We developed a nomogram containing the ICD score, demonstrating a high predictive accuracy with a C-index of 0.703. We further discovered that PSMD2 and PSMD14 could serve as ICD-associated prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC.ConclusionThe ICD score exhibits a high degree of reliability for predicting prognosis and may provide valuable guidance for the selection of immunotherapy for HCC patients. This novel scoring system enables the estimation of clinical immunotherapy response for HCC patients, offering new opportunities for personalized immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05370-1.",1
"PurposeThe combination of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors has a good efficacy in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). The multi-target TKI lenvatinib and NGS-guided targeted therapy are also promising in BTC treatment. This study aimed to explore the performance of GemOX plus sintilimab and TKI (either lenvatinib or by NGS-guided targeted therapy) for local advanced or metastatic BTCs.MethodsThis prospective single-arm study included patients with local advanced or metastatic BTCs and applied intravenous infusion of standard GemOX plus sintilimab and lenvatinib (no targetable gene alterations) or targeted therapy based on NGS (olaparib for BRCA1/2 mutation, dasatinib for IDH1/2 mutation, afatinib for EGFR amplification, lenvatinib for PDGFR and KIT mutation, and lenvatinib for FGFR/KIT mutation).ResultsFrom November 2020 to December 2021, 22 patients BTCs (6 GBC, 14 iCCA, 1 pCCA and 1 dCCA cases) were enrolled, with an average age of 58.4 years. Partial response (PR) was achieved in 10 cases, stable disease (SD) in 9 cases and progression disease (PD) in 3 cases (13.6%). The objective response rate (ORR) was 45.5%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 86.4%. During the treatment, the incidence of adverse reactions was 81.8%, and the incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was 9.09%. For 14 patients with NGS, 5 patients were treated by targeted therapy and there were 1 SD and 4 PR cases. For four patients with positive PD-L1 expression, the ORR was 100%. While among the three patients with super-progression markers such as RET, MDM2 and FGF14/STK24, there were two SD and one PD cases.ConclusionIn patients with advanced BTCs, the combination of GemOX plus sintilimab and lenvatinib or NGS-guided targeted therapy showed promising ORR and DCR, especially for the patients with positive PD-L1 expression and targetable gene alterations.","PurposeOral cancer is a significant global health concern, with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in regions with prevalent tobacco usage such as Asia. Majority of oral cancers are detected at an advanced stage resulting in poor survival outcomes. Moreover, the treatment modalities of oral cancers have remained constant with surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy being mainstays of the treatment. This review provides a significant progress made in understanding the molecular landscape of oral cancers and the evolution of therapeutic strategies toward precision medicine.MethodsA comprehensive literature review was conducted to gather recent studies on the molecular landscape of oral cancers, genomic insights, and clinical trials.ResultsFirstly, genomic insights into oral cancers, including key driver mutations and copy number alterations, are discussed in the context of personalized medicine approaches. Subsequently, advancements in therapeutic strategies, particularly focusing on clinical trials investigating immunotherapy and targeted agents, are highlighted.ConclusionDespite promising results, challenges persist in identifying reliable biomarkers for treatment response and resistance. Continued research efforts are warranted to validate biomarkers and optimize therapeutic interventions, with the goal of enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of oral cancer.",0
"Approximately 50 % of poor prognosis neuroblastomas arise due to MYCN over-expression. We previously demonstrated that MYCN and PRMT5 proteins interact and PRMT5 knockdown led to apoptosis of MYCN-amplified (MNA) neuroblastoma. Here we evaluate the highly selective first-in-class PRMT5 inhibitor GSK3203591 and its in vivo analogue GSK3326593 as targeted therapeutics for MNA neuroblastoma. Cell-line analyses show MYCN-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis, with approximately 200-fold greater sensitivity of MNA neuroblastoma lines. RNA sequencing of three MNA neuroblastoma lines treated with GSK3203591 reveal deregulated MYCN transcriptional programmes and altered mRNA splicing, converging on key regulatory pathways such as DNA damage response, epitranscriptomics and cellular metabolism. Stable isotope labelling experiments in the same cell lines demonstrate that glutamine metabolism is impeded following GSK3203591 treatment, linking with disruption of the MLX/Mondo nutrient sensors via intron retention of MLX mRNA. Interestingly, glutaminase (GLS) protein decreases after GSK3203591 treatment despite unchanged transcript levels. We demonstrate that the RNA methyltransferase METTL3 and cognate reader YTHDF3 proteins are lowered following their mRNAs undergoing GSK3203591-induced splicing alterations, indicating epitranscriptomic regulation of GLS; accordingly, we observe decreases of GLS mRNA m6A methylation following GSK3203591 treatment, and decreased GLS protein following YTHDF3 knockdown. In vivo efficacy of GSK3326593 is confirmed by increased survival of Th-MYCN mice, with drug treatment triggering splicing events and protein decreases consistent with in vitro data. Together our study demonstrates the PRMT5-dependent spliceosomal vulnerability of MNA neuroblastoma and identifies the epitranscriptome and glutamine metabolism as critical determinants of this sensitivity.","The mammalian gut microbiota plays diverse and essential roles in modulating host physiology. Key mediators determining the outcome of the microbiota-host interactions are the small molecule metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. The liver is a major organ exposed to gut microbial metabolites, and it serves as the nexus for maintaining healthy interactions between the gut microbiota and the host. At the same time, the liver is the primary target of potentially harmful gut microbial metabolites. In this review, we provide an up-to-date list of gut microbial metabolites that have been identified to either increase or decrease host susceptibility to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. The signaling pathways and molecular factors involved in the progression of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity are well-established, and we propose that the mouse model of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity serves as a model system for uncovering gut microbial metabolites with previously unknown functions. Furthermore, we envision that gut microbial metabolites identified to alter APAP-induced hepatotoxicity likely have broader implications in other liver diseases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis review provides an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in modulating the host susceptibility to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. It focuses on the roles of gut bacterial small molecule metabolites as mediators of the interaction between the gut microbiota and the liver. It also illustrates the utility of APAP-induced liver injury as a model to identify gut microbial metabolites with biological function.",0
AbstractWe present the case of a 59-year-old Chinese man diagnosed with stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma who developed 2 suspicious lung lesions 5 years after follow-up. Pathological evaluation revealed 2 distinct types of cancer: lung adenocarcinoma in situ and clear cell renal carcinoma with lung metastasis. Lung tissue samples were sequenced using a panel of 1267 cancer-related genes. The analysis revealed completely different molecular profiles between the 2 lung lesions and similar clonal mutations in the superior lingular lobe and kidney. This indicates multiple metachronous primary tumors.,"BackgroundCuproptosis was defined as a novel nonapoptotic cell death pathway and its potential function in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear.MethodsWe obtained gene expression profiles, somatic mutation and corresponding clinical information of 881 ccRCC samples from 3 cohorts including the cancer genome atlas cohort, GSE29609 cohort and CheckMate 025 cohort. As described in the latest published article, we enrolled 16 genes as cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs). We explored the expression level, variants and copy number variation of the CRGs. Univariate and multi-variate regression were utilized to assess the prognostic significance of the CRGs. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to identify potential subgroup and gene set variation analysis was used to explore the potential biological functions. CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE algorithm and single sample gene set enrichment analysis were used to evaluate the tumor microenvironment. In vitro experiments including CCK-8, transwell and wound healing assays were utilized to explore the potential biological function of DLAT in ccRCC.ResultsWe found that except for CDKN2A, the CRGs were positively associated with patients’ OS. Cuproptosis cluster, cuproptosis gene cluster and cuproptosis score were established, respectively, and higher cuproptosis score was significantly associated with a worse OS in ccRCC (p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the cuproptosis-related nomogram at 1 year, 3 years, 5 years was 0.858, 0.821 and 0.78, respectively. In addition, we found that the cuproptosis score was positively associated with PDCD1, CTLA4 expression level, thus the cuproptosis score may also reflect the dysfunction of tumor infiltrating immune cells. In vitro experiments indicated that overexpression of DLAT could inhibited the migration and proliferation ability of ccRCC cells.ConclusionOur findings identify a novel cuproptosis-related signature and the cuproptosis characteristics may influence the anti-tumor immunity though complex regulating networks, and thus cuproptosis may play a role in developing novel therapeutic target of ccRCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05259-z.",1
"BackgroundWe evaluate outcomes of SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinomas in the largest single-institution study.MethodsRetrospective cross-sectional study of patients with SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma between 1998 and 2024. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free probability (RFP) at 1 and 5 years were measured by Kaplan-Meier method.ResultsThere were 47 patients with a median age of 53. Initial pathological diagnosis was altered in 33%. Twelve (34%) patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with one partial response. Curative surgical approach was undertaken in 73%. Definitive chemoradiation was administered in 20%. DSS at 1 and 5 years was 93% and 45%, respectively. RFP at 1 and 5 years was 73% and 33%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, cranial nerve involvement (p=0.01 for DSS) remained significantly worse for DSS and overall survival.ConclusionsSMARCB1-deficient tumors had limited response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cranial nerve involvement was associated with worse prognosis. Optimal treatment is unclear. Surgery should be offered to patients with resectable disease.",Herein we recount the legacy of Sir David Roxbee Cox (15 July 1924 – 18 January 2022) from the perspective of practicing clinicians. His pioneering work in developing the logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression models revolutionized the analysis and interpretation of categorical and time-to-event survival outcomes in modern medicine. This legacy is an inspiration for all those who follow on Sir David Cox’s path.,0
"ObjectiveAlthough the use of osimertinib can significantly improve the survival time of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with epithelial growth factor receptor mutation, eventually drug resistance will limit the survival benefit of most patients. This study aimed to develop a novel prognostic predictive signature based on genes associated with osimertinib resistance.MethodsThe differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with osimertinib resistance in LUAD were screened from Gene Expression Omnibus datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Multivariate cox regression was used to establish a prognostic signature, and then a nomogram was developed to predict the survival probability of LUAD patients. We used ROC curve and DCA curve to evaluate its clinical prediction accuracy and net benefit. In addition, the differentially expressed genes significantly associated with prognosis were selected for immune infiltration analysis and drug sensitivity analysis, and their roles in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma were verified by in vitro experiments.ResultsOur evaluation results indicated that the new nomogram had higher clinical prediction accuracy and net benefit value than the TN nomogram. Further analysis showed that patients with low STRIP2 expression had a higher level of immune response, and may be more likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and conventional antitumor drugs. This may help to select more precise and appropriate therapy for LUAD patients with osimertinib resistance. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that STRIP2 promoted the LUAD cells proliferation, migration and invasion. This further demonstrates the importance of this gene signature for prognostic prediction.ConclusionWe developed a reliable prognostic model based on DEGs associated with osimertinib resistance and screened for biomarker that can predict the immune response in LUAD patients, which may help in the selection of treatment regimens after osimertinib resistance.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05294-w.","PurposeEpidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR–TKIs) are the first-line therapy for patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) harboring activating EGFR mutations. However, the emergence of drug resistance to EGFR–TKIs remains a critical obstacle for successful treatment and is associated with poor patient outcomes. The overarching objective of this study is to apply bioinformatics tools to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying resistance to EGFR–TKIs and develop a robust predictive model.MethodsThe genes associated with gefitinib resistance in the LUAD cell Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were identified using gene chip expression data. Functional enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration analysis were performed to comprehensively explore the mechanism of gefitinib resistance. Furthermore, a GRRG_score was constructed by integrating genes related to LUAD prognosis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database with the screened Gefitinib Resistant Related differentially expressed genes (GRRDEGs) using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) features and their association with immune infiltration between different GRRG_score groups. A prognostic model for LUAD was developed based on the GRRG_score and validated. The HPA database was used to validate protein expression. The CTR-DB database was utilized to validate the results of drug therapy prediction based on the relevant genes.ResultsA total of 110 differentially expression genes were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in Mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, Sphingolipid metabolism. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that biological processes strongly correlated with gefitinib resistance were cell proliferation and immune-related pathways, EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION, APICAL_SURFACE, and APICAL_JUNCTION were highly expressed in the drug-resistant group; KRAS_SIGNALING_DN, HYPOXIA, and HEDGEHOG_SIGNALING were highly expressed in the drug-resistant group. The GRRG_score was constructed based on the expression levels of 13 genes, including HSPA2, ATP8B3, SPOCK1, EIF6, NUP62CL, BCAR3, PCSK9, NT5E, FLNC, KRT8, FSCN1, ANGPTL4, and ID1. We further screened and validated two key genes, namely, NUP62CL and KRT8, which exhibited predictive value for both prognosis and drug resistance.ConclusionsOur study identified several novel GRRDEGs and provided insight into the underlying mechanisms of gefitinib resistance in LUAD. Our results have implications for developing more effective treatment strategies and prognostic models for LUAD patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05129-8.",1
"Purpose Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. To improve the therapeutic outcomes, drug delivery systems, and particularly liposomes, have been widely investigated. Therefore, this review analyzed systematically the literature to inquire about the safety and efficacy of liposomal formulations in lung cancer treatment.MethodsThree electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL) were systematically searched until May 2020. Clinical trials containing information about the effects of liposomal formulations in lung cancer patients were considered eligible.ResultsTwenty two selected studies present different treatment options for both small and non-small-cell lung cancers. After compiling and analyzing all the published information, we verified that combination of liposomal cisplatin and paclitaxel led to a statistically significant improvement of the evaluated outcomes. Moreover, tecemotide, a liposome-based immunotherapy, demonstrated lower toxicity compared to control groups. Evidences that other subgroups could benefit from this formulation were also provided.ConclusionThis systematic review (registration number CRD42021246587) demonstrates that liposomal formulations are promising alternatives to overcome limitations of traditional cancer therapy. However, larger, longer, randomized and double-blinded clinical trials, selecting their patients’ cohort considering more responsive subgroups would be beneficial to strengthen the scientific and clinical evidence of the results herein reported.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04079-x.","Acute myeloid leukaemias harbouring a rearrangement of the mixed lineage leukaemia gene (MLL) are aggressive haematopoietic malignancies that relapse early and have a poor prognosis (event-free survival less than 50%). Menin is a tumour suppressor, however, in MLL-rearranged leukaemias it functions as a co-factor which is mandatory for the leukaemic transformation by interaction with the N-terminal part of MLL, which is maintained in all MLL-fusion proteins. Inhibition of menin blocks leukaemogenesis and leads to differentiation and, in turn, to apoptosis of leukaemic blasts. Furthermore, nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) binds to specific chromatin targets, which are co-occupied by MLL, and menin inhibition has been shown to trigger degradation of mNPM1 resulting in a rapid decrease in gene expression and activating histone modifications. Therefore, disruption of the menin-MLL axis blocks leukaemias driven by NPM1 mutations for which the expression of menin-MLL target genes (for example, MEIS1, HOX etc.) is essential. To date at least six different menin-MLL inhibitors are undergoing clinical evaluation as first- and second-line monotherapy in acute leukaemias: DS-1594, BMF-219, JNJ-75276617, DSP-5336, revumenib, and ziftomenib, however, only for revumenib and ziftomenib early clinical data have been reported. In the revumenib phase I/II AUGMENT-101 trial (N = 68) with very heavily pretreated AML patients the ORR was 53% with a CR rate of 20%. The ORR in patients harbouring MLL rearrangement of mNPM1 was 59%. Patients who achieved a response had a mOS of 7 months. Similar results have been reported for ziftomenib in the phase I/II COMET-001 trial. ORR was 40% and CRc was 35% in AML patients with mNPM1. However, outcome was worse in AML patients with a MLL rearrangement (ORR 16.7%, CRc 11%). Differentiation syndrome was a notable adverse event. The clinical development of novel menin-MLL inhibitors is well in line with the currently ongoing paradigm shift towards targeted therapies seen in the AML treatment landscape. Moreover, the clinical assessment of combinations of these inhibitors with established therapy options in AML could be the fuel for an improved outcome of MLL/NPM1 patients.",1
"BackgroundCAR-T cell (chimeric antigen receptor T) therapy is now part of standard of care treatment of B‑cell lineage malignancies. Although it is an effective treatment, it comes along with adverse side effects and toxicities that may require intensive care therapy. The costs related to critical care therapy in critically ill patients after CAR‑T administration have not been evaluated.Patients and methodsRetrospective analysis of all patients who had received CAR‑T therapy and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care university medical centre in Germany between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2022. Cause of admission and ICU therapy as well as treatment and total hospitals costs were evaluated.ResultsThirty patients with a history of CAR-T cell therapy for underlying haematological malignancy were included. The median age of all patients was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 50–70) and 37% (n = 11) were female. 93% (n = 28) of patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 7% (n = 2) had multiple myeloma. The cohort was stratified whether the ICU admission was CAR‑T therapy related (that is within 30 days after CAR‑T therapy; 73%, n = 22) or the admission was of an other cause (> 30 days after CAR‑T therapy) (27%, n = 8). The median duration from CAR‑T therapy to ICU admission was 6 (range 5–8) days in CAR-T cell therapy associated ICU admissions compared with 52 (range 31–126) days in other admissions. The overall illness severity on admission was numerically higher in CAR-T-related ICU admission compared to other admissions (46 vs. 43 points, p = 0.18). Vasopressor therapy (50% vs. 75%; p = 0.19), invasive mechanical ventilation (27% vs. 50%; p = 0.24) and renal replacement therapy (14% vs. 50%; p < 0.05) were used in CAR-T-associated admission compared to other admissions, respectively. The ICU mortality (23% vs. 50%; p = 0.15) was higher in patients with other ICU admission. Median total costs of the entire inpatient stay in hospital were € 27,845 (range 8661–368,286 €) in CAR-T-associated ICU admissions compared to € 59,234 (range 23,182–127,044 €) in the group of other ICU admissions (costs of the CAR‑T product not included).ConclusionIn relation to the total costs of CAR-T-cell therapy (production of the CAR‑T product), therapy-associated complications have a relatively low impact on the costs and utilization of ICU resources.Supplementary InformationThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00063-024-01230-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeThree dimensional (3D) “in vitro” models are progressively being applied to investigate tumor cell biology and the interaction of cancer cells with tumor microenvironment under conditions more similar and realistic to “in vivo” behavior than standard bidimensional (2D) cultures.MethodsIn the last years, different methods have been developed to create spheroids and organoids and each technique has advantages and limitations also based on individual needs and cell types used. This review offers an overview of methodologies used for 3D systems: scaffold-free and scaffold-based methods up to bioreactors and organ-on-chip models.ResultsThe principal goal for researchers is to select the 3D system that best suits their needs and that reflects the tumor model they want to study. A large chapter is dedicated to the application of these models to lymphomas’ study, a neoplasm still little explored in the 3D field.ConclusionThese innovative and advanced models may represent new tools for cancer research and pre-clinical studies of new therapies in the perspective of precision medicine.",1
"AbstractBackgroundPatients with brain tumors and their families often inquire about driving safety. Currently, there is no consensus regarding fitness-to-drive (FTD) for patients with central nervous system tumors. Our paper aims to provide a multi-disciplinary perspective to address this issue.MethodsWe performed a literature review for brain tumors and driving. Additionally, we solicited input from experts in tumor-related epilepsy, ophthalmology, neuropsychology, occupational therapy, and driving simulators.ResultsWe qualitatively analyzed 14 published articles. FTD determination varies internationally and regionally in most developed nations. Significant motor weakness and major cognitive impairment clearly prevent patients from driving. There are specialized tests for motor, vision, and cognitive correlates important to driving, but driving simulators and on-the-road tests provide the most comprehensive assessments. FTD for patients with seizures is dependent on region-specific laws that take into account the duration of seizure-free intervals and history of motor vehicular crashes.ConclusionsWe recommend a symptom-based approach that highlights the importance of interdisciplinary assessment to ensure that brain tumor patients have the minimum operational skills required to drive. It is crucial to document seizure control, visual acuity impairment, and visual field deficits because these factors usually become the default basis in practice to determine if driving privileges can be maintained. Appropriately, timed assessment of cognitive function may provide pertinent information to determine FTD. Formalized testing with practical driving evaluation may eventually be necessary in patients who have hemiparesis, hemiplegia, hemineglect, homonymous visual field loss, or any form of cognitive dysfunction to determine FTD.","BackgroundThe survival trends and prognostic factors of patients with extraosseous plasmacytoma (EOP) or extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) have not been reported in recent years. The objective of this study was to develop a novel nomogram and risk stratification system for predicting the overall survival (OS) of elderly patients with EOP based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.MethodsThe demographic characteristics of 900 patients aged 60 years and above, diagnosed with EOP between 2000 and 2019, were extracted from the SEER database. The patient population was randomly divided into a training cohort and an internal validation cohort in a ratio of 7:3. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of prognosis in elderly EOP patients, followed by developing a nomogram for prognostic assessment. The performance of the model was evaluated through receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, C-index, calibration curves for calibration accuracy assessment, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess its clinical utility. All elderly EOP patients were stratified into three risk subgroups by cutoff value utilizing X-tile software based on their total OS scores for comparative analysis purposes. Kaplan–Meier (K–M) survival curve analysis was employed to validate any observed differences in OS among these three risk groups.ResultsSix factors including age, year of diagnosis, marital status, primary site, surgery, and prior tumor history were identified to be independently predictive of the OS of elderly patients with EOP, and these predictors were included in the construction of the nomogram. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year area under the curves (AUCs) for OS were 0.717, 0.754, and 0.734 in the training cohort and 0.740, 0.730, and 0.765 in the validation cohort, respectively. The C-index values in the two cohorts were 0.695 and 0.690. The calibration curves and DCA exhibit commendable consistency and validity, respectively, thereby demonstrating their robust performance. The training set was stratified into low-, medium-, and high-risk subgroups based on the optimal cutoff points (167.8 and 264.8) identified. The K–M curve and cumulative risk curve exhibited statistically significant disparities in survival rates among the groups.ConclusionsWe developed a nomogram and risk classification system, which can serve as an intuitive and effective tool for clinicians to enhance the prediction of OS in elderly EOP patients, thereby facilitating the formulation of more rational and personalized treatment strategies.",0
"SummarySomatic mutations commonly occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Some mutant clones outgrow through clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and produce mutated immune progenies shaping host immunity. Individuals with CH are asymptomatic but have an increased risk of developing leukemia, cardiovascular and pulmonary inflammatory diseases, and severe infections. Using genetic engineering of human HSCs (hHSCs) and transplantation in immunodeficient mice, we describe how a commonly mutated gene in CH, TET2, affects human neutrophil development and function. TET2 loss in hHSCs produce a distinct neutrophil heterogeneity in bone marrow and peripheral tissues by increasing the repopulating capacity of neutrophil progenitors and giving rise to low-granule neutrophils. Human neutrophils that inherited TET2 mutations mount exacerbated inflammatory responses and have more condensed chromatin, which correlates with compact neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production. We expose here physiological abnormalities that may inform future strategies to detect TET2-CH and prevent NET-mediated pathologies associated with CH.","ObjectivesThe programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) in tumor tissue samples is an established clinical biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the significance of PD-L1 expression in other types of samples has not been fully investigated.Patients and methodsWe conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of advanced NSCLC patients who received ICI treatment during the clinical course and investigated the effects of ICIs according to PD-L1 expression in cytology samples, including cell block and endobronchial ultrasound-guided (EBUS) transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) samples.ResultsA total of 264 patients were included in this study: PD-L1 expression was determined in cell block or TBNA specimens in 55 patients, and in tissue samples in 209 patients. Among the former patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) of those with a TPS for PD-L1 ≥ 50% was significantly longer compared to that of those with a TPS < 50% (6.5 vs. 1.9 months, respectively, p = 0.008). When the cutoff value was set at 1%, the median PFS was 4.2 months in patients with a TPS ≥ 1% and 1.5 months in patients with a TPS < 1% (p < 0.001).ConclusionPD-L1 expression determined using cytology specimens predicts the efficacy of ICIs.",0
"Aim: To define the prognostic significance of first-line TKI in mRCC patients receiving nivolumab.Materials and methods: A total of 571 mRCC patients who received ≥second line nivolumab were included in this subanalysis. The correlation between prior TKI (sunitinib vs. pazopanib) and overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate, progression-free survival and overall survival were investigated. Additionally, the impact of TKI choice according to the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium prognostic score was examined.Results: There was no significant difference between sunitinib and pazopanib groups in terms of mPFS, mOS, overall response rate and disease control rate. Moreover, no difference between sunitinib and pazopanib was found according to the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium prognostic score.Conclusion: There is no conclusive evidence favoring pazopanib or sunitinib treatment before initiating nivolumab therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.","Purpose The rise of female breast cancer has created a significant global public health issue that requires effective solutions. Disulfidptosis, a recently identified form of cell death characterized by an excessive accumulation of disulfides, has unique initiatory and regulatory mechanisms. The formation of disulfide bonds is a metabolic event typically associated with cysteines. This study aims to explore the potential of the affinity between cysteine metabolism and disulfidptosis in risk stratification for breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA).MethodsWe used correlation analysis to decipher co-relation genes between cysteine metabolism and disulfidptosis (CMDCRGs). Both LASSO regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were employed to construct the prognostic signature. Additionally, we conducted investigations concerning subtype identification, functional enhancement, mutation landscape, immune infiltration, drug prioritization, and single-cell analysis.ResultsWe developed and validated a six-gene prognostic signature as an independent prognostic predictor for BRCA. The prognostic nomogram, based on risk score, demonstrated a favorable capability in predicting survival outcomes. We identified distinct gene mutations, functional enhancements, and immune infiltration patterns between the two risk groups. Four clusters of drugs were predicted as potentially effective for patients in the low-risk group. We identified seven cell clusters within the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer, and RPL27A was found to be widely expressed in this environment.ConclusionMultidimensional analyses confirmed the clinical utility of the cysteine metabolism-disulfidptosis affinity-based signature in risk stratification and guiding personalized treatment for patients with BRCA.",0
"BackgroundWith the update and release of the newest version of WHO classification  for neuroendocrine neoplasm, the clinical features, risk factors of prognosis and the effect of surgical treatment on newly classified pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (pNEC) patients with liver metastasis were not deeply analyzed. In the present study, we tried to reveal the clinical features, and prognostic factors of pNEC patients with liver metastasis with the newest definition of WHO 2019, and explore whether primary tumor resection (PTR), chemotherapy and radiotherapy affect overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in those patients.MethodsWe collected data from pNEC patients with liver metastasis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who were diagnosed between 2010 and 2019. We strictly selected pNEC patients according to the 2019 WHO classification criteria. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to determine independent predictors of the survival of these patients. The forest plots map was drawn by R-4.2.2 software to display the results of the multivariate analysis visually. Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the OS and CSS. Based on the multivariate analysis outcomes, we established the predictable nomogram model to predict the prognosis of pNEC patients with liver metastasis. The calibration plots were shown to prove the predictive value of the nomogram predictable model.ResultsWe identified 205 eligible pNEC patients with liver metastasis. According to the multivariable Cox regression analysis in this study, we found that PTR, chemotherapy, primary tumor size and diagnosis to treatment time were independent prognostic factors for both OS and CSS. Kaplan–Meier survival curves demonstrated that PTR and chemotherapy were correlated with increased survival for pNEC patients with liver metastasis. The accuracy of the nomogram model was visually proved by the calibration plot with acceptable predictive performance.ConclusionFour independent predictors of prognosis in pNEC patients with liver metastasis were identified in this study, including PTR, chemotherapy, tumor size and diagnosis to treatment time. PTR and chemotherapy for pNEC with liver metastasis could lead to a better prognosis, which may provide inspiration for practical clinical guidelines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04847-3.","PurposeLiver metastasis (LM) is common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and always predicted worse outcomes with no effective therapy. We aimed to evaluate the effects and prognosis in LM patients treated with anlotinib.MethodsThe present study is a post hoc analysis based on a multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical trial which designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC. A total of 437 patients were enrolled in present study, and 78 patients with LM.ResultsPatients with LM showed a worse outcome compared to those without LM (PFS median, 2.6 vs 4.2 months), and OS (median, 5.6 vs 9.4 months, both P < 0.0001). The anlotinib was associated with longer PFS (median, 3.0 months) compared with placebo (median, 0.9 months), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.23 (95%CI, 0.12–0.42; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, OS was marginally significantly better in anlotinib group (median 6.6 months), compared with placebo (median 4.0 months), HR 0.61 (95%CI, 0.36–1.02; P = 0.055). Multivariate analysis confirmed normal peripheral blood LDH/TBiL level predicted better PFS and OS, lower ECOG score acted as independently prognostic factor for superior OS. Anlotinib was more associated with hand–foot syndrome (7.7% vs 0) and serum TSH level rise (7.7% vs 3.8%) and well tolerated, all AEs were no more than grade 3.ConclusionPatients with LM had a dismal prognosis, anlotinib could lead to a better PFS in pretreated NSCLC patients, which suggested anlotinib is a potential third-line or further therapy in these patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03964-9.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDThe paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are an uncommon phenomenon with diverse clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of PNS is often challenging because of the broad range of clinical manifestations and the difficulties in the detection of antibodies (AB) that are confirmatory for the diagnosis. Recently published Updated Diagnostic Criteria for PNS improved the efficacy and accuracy of clinical practice but leaves a “gray zone”. The utilization of immunotherapy is rapidly expanding, but the safety and the efficacy of the immunotherapy in PNS patients are unclear as well. Managing PNS is challenging, as there is no consensus on the type of immunomodulatory therapy and the indications for advanced treatment lines. MATERIAL AND METHODSWe retrospectively evaluated the data about the case of PNS treated in the neurology department and Neuro-oncology unit at Sheba MC Israel. RESULTS68 years old male was hospitalized at July 2022 with C7-T3 myelopathy syndrome. The evaluation was negative excluding protein 75 mg/dl and mild pleocytosis, but negative cytology. There was clinical improvement after Methylprednisolon treatment. At March 2023 the patient admitted with acute onset of Lt. hemiparesis and Lt. hemihypoesthesia that developed three weeks after COVID-19 infection. PNS panels of high-risk and low-risk AB in serum and CSF were negative. The Brain MRI showed Rt. thalamic and internal capsule lesion that was hyperintense in FLAIR sequence and homogeneously enhanced by contrast in T1 sequence. The lesion was diagnosed as TUMEFACTIVE demyelinating lesion. Transient clinical and radiological response on steroids treatment was reached. The systemic evaluation revealed the Rt. axillary mass that was diagnosed as BRAF V600E mutated melanoma and case was diagnose as probable PNS. The treatment by BRAF and MEK inhibitors was started and sustained clinical and radiological neurological improvement and oncological complete response were reached.CONCLUSIONMany questions arise while making therapeutic decisions that relate to PNS. One of those is the question of if cancer therapy alone is sufficient and if it is possible to skip the advanced immunomodulatory treatment lines, because immunosuppression constitutes an aggravating prognostic factor for oncological outcome. New targeted oncological therapies have a short time to response which makes this therapeutic approach possible and our case illustrates the concept.","AbstractGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor with a median survival rate of 14 months. Despite the success of immunotherapy in treating various cancer types, its efficacy remains poor in GBM. Such limitation can be attributed to the profound immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of GBM enriched with the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Quaking (Qki) is an RNA-binding protein that is mutated or deleted in more than 35% of GBM patients. Decreased levels of Qki in TAMs associates with worsened survival rates and responsiveness to immunotherapy in GBM mouse and patients. Moreover, Qki is a tumor suppressor gene in GBM and a major regulator in phagocytosis, a fundamental biological process in delivering antigens to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II). MHC II-restricted antigen presentation in macrophages of GBM is important in maintaining the fitness of cytotoxic and helper T cells required in anti-tumor response. However, the mechanism through which Qki regulates MHCII expression and presentation has yet to be elucidated. I hypothesize that Qki promotes MHC II expression in TAMs, thereby constraining the development and progression of GBM. In vitro assays like immunofluorescent staining, qRT-PCR, cell co-culture system, and flow cytometry will be performed involving QPP (Qk-/-Trp53-/-; Pten-/-) mouse brains, QPP cells, and mouse macrophage cell lines. A positive correlation between transcriptomic and protein expression levels of Qki, MHC II, and CIITA (a master regulator of MHC II) was confirmed in both mouse QPP and human GBM samples. Moreover, bone-marrow-derived macrophages activated by QPP cell supernatant shows upregulated levels of Qki and thus MHC II genes. A preliminary conclusion is that Qki plays a permissive role in MHCII expression in TAMs of GBM. Further downstream impact of Qki in TAMs will be evaluated in T cell activity and in transcription of MHC II in TAMs.",0
"AbstractIntroductionAmong older adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy, frailty indices predict OS and toxicity. Given the increased use of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC), we evaluated frailty and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) among older adults with aNSCLC receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted therapy.MethodsPatients aged ≥ 65 with aNSCLC starting systemic therapy with non-curative intent underwent geriatric assessments over 6 months. We developed a deficit-accumulation frailty index to categorize patients as robust, pre-frail, or frail. To evaluate associations between frailty and KPS with OS, we used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for race, insurance, and treatment. We used logistic regression to evaluate hospitalizations, functional decline, and severe toxicity.ResultsAmong 155 patients (median age 73), 45.8% were robust, 36.1% pre-frail, and 18.2% frail; 34.8% had a KPS ≥ 90, 32.9% had a KPS of 80, and 32.3% had a KPS ≤ 70. The median OS was 17.9 months. Pre-frail/frail patients had worse OS compared to robust patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.09, 95% CI, 1.31-3.34) and were more likely to be hospitalized (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.21, 95% CI, 1.09-4.48), functionally decline (adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI, 1.09-4.78), and experience grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicity (adjusted OR 5.18, 95% CI, 1.02-26.03). KPS was only associated with OS.Conclusions Our frailty index was associated with OS, hospitalization, functional decline, and hematologic AEs among older adults with aNSCLC receiving systemic therapies, while KPS was only associated with OS. Pretreatment frailty assessment may help identify older adults at risk for poor outcomes to optimize decision-making and supportive care.","HPV vaccination rates remain suboptimal in the United States. While the current literature focuses on expressly hesitant parents, few studies have examined parents with “high intent”, or those indicating they definitely will vaccinate and have had the opportunity but not yet vaccinated their adolescents. Our objective was to differentiate characteristics of mothers with high intent from those who already vaccinated their adolescents using various socioeconomic, previous vaccine decision-making, and healthcare provider relationship-related variables. English-speaking mothers or female guardians of adolescents ages 11-14 years living in low HPV vaccine uptake states within the U.S. in September 2018 were recruited from a national survey panel as part of a larger study. We assessed HPV vaccine status of their adolescents and categorized respondents into two categories: Already Vaccinated and High Intent. We assessed differences using a multivariable logistic regression model. Among 2,406 mothers, 18% reported high intent vs. 82% already having vaccinated. Mothers with high intent were more likely to identify as non-Hispanic White (p=0.01), to have a younger adolescent (p<0.001), and to report not receiving a provider HPV vaccination recommendation (p<0.001). Mothers who estimated that half/more (vs. less) of their child’s friends have received/will receive the vaccine had higher odds of already vaccinating (p<0.001). Our findings suggest that clinicians may be able to improve HPV vaccination uptake within their practices by giving repeated, high-quality recommendations to parents of children who are not yet vaccinated. Additionally, these findings indicate perceived social norms may play a large role in on-time vaccine uptake. Reassuring hesitant parents that most parents accept the vaccine may also improve uptake in clinical practice.",0
"Primary melanoma of the oral cavity is extremely rare, accounting for 0.2–8% of all melanomas. Lesions arising from mucosal melanocytes occur most frequently on the gingiva or palate. Mucosal melanomas carry a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanomas. Very few studies have been published due to rarity of disease. 46 year old lady presented with black colored lesion over left side of her tongue for 6 weeks. On examination there was 3 × 2.5 cm black colored patch over left lateral part of tongue in middle 1/3rd, not crossing midline. Tip and base of tongue were free. Biopsy was suggestive of malignant melanoma of tongue. Patient underwent surgery (wide local excision of left lateral border of tongue lesion + left selective neck dissection). Final Histopathological report revealed malignant melanoma of tongue with all margins free, Depth of invasion 3 mm, Lympho-vascular invasion present, and no perineural invasion, left level III cervical lymph node metastases. Patient thus received adjuvant RT. Immunotherapy was also advised in multidisciplinary clinic, but patient was non-compliant. Early diagnosis will be promoted by careful oral examination and early biopsy of pigmented and non-pigmented masses. Early diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis of patients with oral malignant melanoma.","IntroductionPoliovirus receptor (PVR) is a tumor promoter and a regulatory checkpoint that enhances immunosuppression. We investigated PVR expression by applying immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A positive association existed between PVR expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) expression in patients with surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PVR expression is a prognosis predictor of lung adenocarcinoma.PurposeTo investigate the prognostic significance of PVR expression and CTLA4 expression for surgically resected NSCLC.Patients and methodsThe medical records of 108 Chinese patients with primary NSCLC who underwent surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of PVR and CTLA4 were measured through IHC. Clinical characteristics, the association between PVR and CTLA4, and the prognostic significance of PVR were analyzed.ResultsA significant positive association was observed between PVR and CTLA4 expression in NSCLC (P = 0.016). PVR had a high positive rate among females, nonsmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma and advanced lung cancer. The overall survival (OS) of patients with negative PVR expression was significantly longer than that of patients with positive PVR expression (P = 0.049), especially among females (P = 0.03) and nonsmokers (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis results showed that advanced tumor stage and PVR expression were independent prognosis predictors of poor OS.ConclusionPVR can potentially serve as a prognostic predictor and biomarker for NSCLC and cancer anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03189-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"BackgroundTumor endothelial cells (TECs) play a significant role in regulating the tumor microenvironment, drug response, and immune cell activities in various cancers. However, the association between TEC gene expression signature and patient prognosis or therapeutic response remains poorly understood.MethodsWe analyzed transcriptomics data of normal and tumor endothelial cells obtained from the GEO database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with TECs. We then compared these DEGs with those commonly found across five different tumor types from the TCGA database to determine their prognostic relevance. Using these genes, we constructed a prognostic risk model integrated with clinical features to develop a nomogram model, which we validated through biological experiments.ResultsWe identified 12 TEC-related prognostic genes across multiple tumor types, of which five genes were sufficient to construct a prognostic risk model with an AUC of 0.682. The risk scores effectively predicted patient prognosis and immunotherapeutic response. Our newly developed nomogram model provided more accurate prognostic estimates of cancer patients than the TNM staging method (AUC = 0.735) and was validated using external patient cohorts. Finally, RT–PCR and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the expression of these 5 TEC-related prognostic genes was up-regulated in both patient-derived tumors and cancer cell lines, while depletion of the hub genes reduced cancer cell growth, migration and invasion, and enhanced their sensitivity to gemcitabine or cytarabine.ConclusionsOur study discovered the first TEC-related gene expression signature that can be used to construct a prognostic risk model for guiding treatment options in multiple cancers.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04848-2.","Background and ObjectivesTo assess mismatch repair (MMR) status and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix and their association with clinicopathologic parameters.Material and MethodsExpression of PD-L1 and MMR status (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2) was assessed on 50 cases of SCCs of the cervix by immunohistochemistry.Results80% of tumor cells and 84% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed PD-L1 expression. 80% of cases had a combined positive score (CPS) of > 1, whereas 20% had a CPS of < 1. 94% of cases showed pMMR proteins, while 6% showed dMMR. 94% of the SCCs were HPV associated, and 6% were HPV-independent. All HPV-independent SCCs of the cervix showed PD-L1 expression, and all HPV-associated SCCs showed MMR deficiency. Between PD-L1 expression in the tumor and the grade of the tumor, a statistically significant association was noted (p = 0.022). All MMR-deficient SCCs were HPV-independent.ConclusionThis research highlighted the HPV association in cervical SCCs in the Indian population. Most of the cervical SCCs were HPV-associated. Furthermore, most of the HPV-associated SCCs were MMR stable. This study found no significant association between MMR status and PD-L1 expression in cervical SCCs.",0
"AbstractBackgroundThe discovery of glioblastoma (GBM)-initiating cells (GICs) has impacted GBM research. These cells are not only tumorigenic but also exhibit resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize GICs thoroughly and identify new therapeutic targets. In a previous study, we successfully identified epithelial-V–like antigen 1 (EVA1) as a novel functional factor specific to GICs.MethodsHybridoma cells were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with EVA1-Fc fusion protein. The reactivity of the supernatant from these hybridoma cells was examined using EVA1-overexpressing cells and GICs. Candidate antibodies were further selected using Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis and 2 cytotoxicity assays—antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Among the antibodies, the cytotoxicity of the B2E5-antibody drug conjugate (B2E5-ADC) was evaluated by both adding it to cultured GICs and injecting it into GIC tumor-bearing brains.ResultsB2E5 demonstrated a high affinity for human EVA1 and effectively killed both EVA1-expressing cell lines and GICs in culture through ADCC and CDC. B2E5-ADC also exhibited strong cytotoxicity to GICs in culture and prevented their tumorigenesis in the brain when administered intracranially to the tumor-bearing brain.ConclusionOur data indicate that B2E5-ADC is a new and promising therapeutic strategy for GBM.","AbstractBackgroundRecurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG) lacks effective life-prolonging treatments and the efficacy of systemic PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors is limited. The multi-cohort Glitipni phase I trial investigates the safety and feasibility of intraoperative intracerebral (iCer) and postoperative intracavitary (iCav) nivolumab (NIVO) ± ipilimumab (IPI) treatment following maximal safe resection (MSR) in rHGG.Materials and methods Patients received 10 mg IV NIVO within 24 h before surgery, followed by MSR, iCer 5 mg IPI and 10 mg NIVO, and Ommaya catheter placement in the resection cavity. Biweekly postoperative iCav administrations of 1–5–10 mg NIVO (cohort 4) or 10 mg NIVO plus 1–5–10 mg IPI (cohort 7) were combined with 10 mg IV NIVO for 11 cycles.Results42 rHGG patients underwent MSR with iCer NIVO + IPI. 16 pts were treated in cohort 4 (postoperative iCav NIVO at escalating doses) while 28 patients were treated in cohort 7 (intra and postoperative iCav NIVO and escalating doses of IPI). The most common TRAE was fatigue; no grade 5 AE occurred. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 neutrophilic pleocytosis (4 pts) receiving iCav NIVO plus 5 or 10 mg IPI. PFS and OS did not significantly differ between cohorts (median OS: 42 [95% CI 26–57] vs. 35 [29–40] weeks; 1-year OS rate: 37% vs. 29%). Baseline B7–H3 expression significantly correlated with worse survival. OS compared favorably to a historical pooled cohort (n = 469) of Belgian rHGG pts treated with anti-VEGF therapies (log-rank P = .015).ConclusionIntraoperative iCer IPI + NIVO with postoperative iCav NIVO ± IPI up to biweekly doses of 1 mg IPI + 10 mg NIVO is feasible and safe, showing encouraging OS in rHGG patients.

"ALK5 inhibitors represent an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of a variety of pathologies, including cancer and fibrosis. Herein, we report the design and in vitro characterization of a novel series of ALK5 modulators featuring a 4,6-disubstituted pyridazine core. A knowledge-based scaffold-hopping exploration was initially conducted on a restricted set of heteroaromatic cores using available ligand- and structure-based information. The most potent structurally novel hit compound 2A was subsequently subjected to a preliminary optimization for the inhaled delivery, applying physicochemical criteria aimed at minimizing systemic exposure to limit the risk of adverse side effects. The resulting inhibitors showed a marked boost in potency against ALK5 and in vitro ADME properties, potentially favoring lung retention. The optimized hits 20 and 23 might thus be considered promising starting points for the development of novel inhaled ALK5 inhibitors.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown significant efficacy in hematological diseases. However, CAR T therapy has demonstrated limited efficacy in solid tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). One of the most important reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune cells used to eliminate tumor cells. The human transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) plays a crucial role in forming the suppressive GBM TME and driving the suppression of the anti-GBM response. To mitigate TGF-β-mediated suppressive activity, we combined a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor II (dnTGFβRII) with our previous bicistronic CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 construct, currently being evaluated in a clinical trial, to generate CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII, a tri-modular construct we are developing for clinical application. We hypothesized that this approach would more effectively subvert resistance mechanisms observed with GBM. Our data suggest that CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII significantly augments T cell proliferation, enhances functional responses, and improves the fitness of bystander cells, particularly by decreasing the TGF-β concentration in a TGF-β-rich TME. In addition, in vivo studies validate the safety and efficacy of the dnTGFβRII cooperating with CARs in targeting and eradicating GBM in an NSG mouse model.",1
"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a vital chaperone involved in the folding and stabilization of various cellular proteins, regulates key functions in many tumor cells. In the context of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), where HSP90’s role remains largely unexplored, we aimed to investigate the significance of HSP90 inhibitor, AUY922, in regulating the YAP1/TEAD pathway and its association with the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Our results showed that AUY922 effectively inhibited GAC aggressiveness in both the invitro and invivo models, induced apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest. Various functional assays elucidated that AUY922 potently inhibited the expression and interaction among YAP1/TEAD and HSP90, resulting in down-regulation of target functional genes. AUY922 additionally altered the tumor microenvironment (TME) into an inflamed state with increased cytokine production in T cells, including interferon gamma, granzyme B, and perforin, and inhibited M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, rendering it a favorable partner for immune checkpoint inhibition. Our findings highlighted the suggestion of targeting HSP90 in GAC therapy via down-regulating YAP1/TEAD signaling. Additionally, our results suggest that AUY922’s ability to reshape the GAC TME favoring the host sets the stage for a clinical trial that combines HSP90 and checkpoint inhibition, where HSP90 could serve as a biomarker for patient selection.","PurposeNRAS plays a pivotal role in progression of various kinds of somatic malignancies; however, the correlation between NRAS and lung adenocarcinoma is less known. We aim to analyze the prognostic value of NRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma, and explore the relationship between NRAS and tumor immune microenvironment.MethodsWe obtained the transcriptome profiles and clinical data of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and three Genome Expression Omnibus datasets. Specimens from 325 patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma were collected for immunohistochemical assays of NRAS, PD-L1, PD-1 and TIM-3. Then, we performed gene set enrichment analysis to investigate cancer-related and immune-related signaling pathways. TIMER algorithms were performed to evaluate tumor immune infiltrating cells and immune-related biomarkers.ResultsCompared with adjacent non-tumor tissue, NRAS expression was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissue. NRAS expression was significantly correlated with more advanced stage and positive lymph nodes. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox analysis suggested that high NRAS expression led to a poor prognosis, and could be an independent prognostic factor in LUAD patients. Besides, NRAS expression was positively correlated with CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, and negatively correlated with B cells and CD4+ T cells. The expression level of NRAS was positively correlated with PD-L1, PD-1, and TIM-3 both at RNA and protein level.ConclusionsTo conclude, we found NRAS is a novel prognostic biomarker in LUAD. Besides, the expression level of NRAS may influence the prognosis of LUAD via various kinds of cancer-related pathways and remodeling TIM.",1
"AbstractDespite advances in immunotherapy, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains challenging to treat due to its low inherent immunogenicity and a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Converting “cold” GBMs to “hot” tumors is crucial for effective immune activation and improved patient outcomes. We comprehensively characterized the rWTC-MBTA autologous cancer vaccine, consisting of Mannan-BAM-anchored irradiated whole tumor cells, Toll-like receptor ligands (LTA, Poly(I:C), R-848), and an anti-CD40 agonistic antibody, in preclinical GL261 and SB28 GBM models. A substantial number of vaccinated mice exhibited complete regression of GBM tumors in a T-cell-dependent manner, with no significant toxicity. Long-term tumor-specific immune memory was confirmed upon tumor rechallenge. In the vaccine-draining lymph nodes of the SB28 model, rWTC-MBTA vaccination triggered a major rise in cDC1 12 hours post-treatment, followed by an increase in cDC2, moDC, and pDC on Days 5 and 13. Enhanced cytotoxicity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vaccinated mice was verified in co-culture with tumor cells. Comprehensive immunophenotyping in the GL261 and SB28 GBM microenvironments confirmed decreased regulatory T cells and increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration in vaccinated mice. T-cell exhaustion analyses revealed an increase in the Tim3+CD8+ T cells. No significant differences were observed in the quantification of M-MDSC and PMN-MDSC between control and vaccinated mice, but PD-L1 expression significantly increased in M2 macrophages in vaccinated mice. Our findings demonstrate that rWTC-MBTA induces potent and long-term adaptive immune responses against GBM, warranting further investigation of combinations with other immunotherapies for enhanced efficacy.","The last decade has seen rapid development in the field of cellular immunotherapy, particularly in regard to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells. However, challenges, such as severe treatment-related toxicities and inconsistent quality of autologous products, have hindered the broader use of CAR-T cell therapy, highlighting the need to explore alternative immune cells for cancer targeting. In this regard, natural killer (NK) cells have been extensively studied in cellular immunotherapy and were found to exert cytotoxic effects without being restricted by human leukocyte antigen and have a lower risk of causing graft-versus-host disease; making them favorable for the development of readily available ""off-the-shelf"" products. Clinical trials utilizing unedited NK cells or reprogrammed NK cells have shown early signs of their effectiveness against tumors. However, limitations, including limited in vivo persistence and expansion potential, remained. To enhance the antitumor function of NK cells, advanced gene-editing technologies and combination approaches have been explored. In this review, we summarize current clinical trials of antitumor NK cell therapy, provide an overview of innovative strategies for reprogramming NK cells, which include improvements in persistence, cytotoxicity, trafficking and the ability to counteract the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and also discuss some potential combination therapies.",0
"Undifferentiated melanoma, defined as melanoma that has lost all usual phenotypic and immunohistochemical characteristics of conventional melanoma, can pose significant diagnostic challenges. Molecular studies have advanced our understanding of undifferentiated melanoma by demonstrating that a subset of these tumors harbors known melanoma driver alterations in genes such as BRAF, NRAS, and NF1. However, there is a paucity of data describing genetic alterations that may distinguish undifferentiated melanoma from conventional melanoma. In this study, we directly compared the genomic profiles of undifferentiated melanoma to a cohort of conventional melanomas, including 14 undifferentiated melanoma cases (comprised of 2 primary cases, 2 cutaneous recurrences, and 10 metastases) and a cohort of 127 conventional melanomas including primary, recurrent, and metastatic cases. Targeted sequencing of 447 cancer-associated genes was performed, including identification of mutations and copy number alterations. NRAS was the most frequent melanoma driver in undifferentiated melanoma (8/14 cases, 57%), although notably, only 1 undifferentiated melanoma harbored an NRAS Q61R mutation. Compared with the conventional melanoma cohort, undifferentiated melanoma demonstrated statistically significant enrichment of pathogenic activating RAC1 mutations (6/14 total cases, 43%), including P29S (4/6 cases), P29L (1/6 cases), and D11E (1/6 cases). In addition to providing insight into the molecular pathogenesis of undifferentiated melanoma, these findings also suggest that RAS Q61R immunohistochemistry may have limited utility for its diagnosis. The presence of recurrent RAC1 mutations in undifferentiated melanoma is also notable as these alterations may contribute to mitogen-activated protein kinase pathwayetargeted therapy resistance. Furthermore, the RAC1 alterations identified in this cohort have been shown to drive a melanocytic to mesenchymal switch in melanocytes, offering a possible explanation for the undifferentiated phenotype of these melanomas.","ObjectiveTo compare the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) combined with intravesical chemotherapy (IVC) against intravesical BCG immunotherapy in high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT).Materials and methods130 patients with high-risk NMIBC who had underwent TURBT were divided into two groups, of which IAC + IVC group received four courses of IAC (cisplatin and epirubicin) combined with IVC (epirubicin or pirarubicin) after surgery and BCG group received intravesical BCG immunotherapy. Recurrence rate and progression rate were assessed by Chi-square test, while recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method.ResultsIn this study, the recurrence rate was 27.9% (12/43) in IAC + IVC group and 26.4% (14/53) in BCG group, while progression rate was 9.3% (4/43) in IAC + IVC group and 9.4% (5/53) in BCG group. Both of the recurrence and progression rate did not show a significant difference. In the Kaplan–Meier plot, no difference was found with respect to recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival. Moreover, 46.5% (20/43) patients suffered from adverse events of IAC and 83.1% (49/59) patients suffered from adverse events associated with BCG, of which 6 patients discontinued treatment due to serious adverse events of BCG. Univariate analysis suggested that only recurrent tumor could be an independent risk factor related to recurrence.ConclusionsIAC combined with IVC used in high-risk NMIBC could reduce the recurrence and progression as effective as BCG instillation with lower adverse events.",0
"AbstractBackgroundRecurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG) lacks effective life-prolonging treatments and the efficacy of systemic PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors is limited. The multi-cohort Glitipni phase I trial investigates the safety and feasibility of intraoperative intracerebral (iCer) and postoperative intracavitary (iCav) nivolumab (NIVO) ± ipilimumab (IPI) treatment following maximal safe resection (MSR) in rHGG.Materials and methods Patients received 10 mg IV NIVO within 24 h before surgery, followed by MSR, iCer 5 mg IPI and 10 mg NIVO, and Ommaya catheter placement in the resection cavity. Biweekly postoperative iCav administrations of 1–5–10 mg NIVO (cohort 4) or 10 mg NIVO plus 1–5–10 mg IPI (cohort 7) were combined with 10 mg IV NIVO for 11 cycles.Results42 rHGG patients underwent MSR with iCer NIVO + IPI. 16 pts were treated in cohort 4 (postoperative iCav NIVO at escalating doses) while 28 patients were treated in cohort 7 (intra and postoperative iCav NIVO and escalating doses of IPI). The most common TRAE was fatigue; no grade 5 AE occurred. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 neutrophilic pleocytosis (4 pts) receiving iCav NIVO plus 5 or 10 mg IPI. PFS and OS did not significantly differ between cohorts (median OS: 42 [95% CI 26–57] vs. 35 [29–40] weeks; 1-year OS rate: 37% vs. 29%). Baseline B7–H3 expression significantly correlated with worse survival. OS compared favorably to a historical pooled cohort (n = 469) of Belgian rHGG pts treated with anti-VEGF therapies (log-rank P = .015).ConclusionIntraoperative iCer IPI + NIVO with postoperative iCav NIVO ± IPI up to biweekly doses of 1 mg IPI + 10 mg NIVO is feasible and safe, showing encouraging OS in rHGG patients.

"AbstractObjectiveNon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading attributor to cancer deaths. High HDAC10 and low microRNA (miR)-223-5p levels have been observed in NSCLC. But their roles remain elusive. This study illustrated their roles in NSCLC cell ferroptosis and the mechanism.MethodsHDAC10, miR-223-5p, and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) levels in cells were determined by RT-qPCR. Iron ion content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione (GSH) levels were tested using reagent kits, and levels of SLC7A11 and Acyl-CoA synthesis long chain family (ACSL4) were examined using Western blot. Chromatin immunoprecision was performed to analyze the enrichment of HDAC10 and acetylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9ac) on the miR-223-5p promoter. The targeted binding of miR-223-5p and SLC7A11 was analyzed by dual-luciferase assay. Joint experiments were designed to identify the role of miR-223-5p/SLC7A11 axis in HDAC10-regulated ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.ResultsHDAC10 was highly expressed in NSCLC cells. Silencing HDAC10 significantly reduced GSH and SLC7A11 levels, upregulated iron ion content, ROS levels, and ACSL4 expression, promoting cell ferroptosis. Mechanically, HDAC10 inhibited miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby targeting SLC7A11. The joint experimental results showed that overexpression of SLC7A11 or downregulation of miR-223-5p alleviated the promoting effect of silencing HDAC10 on ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.ConclusionHDAC10 inhibits miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby promoting SLC7A11 expression and inhibiting ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia among the elderly, affects numerous individuals worldwide. Despite advances in understanding the molecular underpinnings of AD pathology, effective treatments to prevent or cure the disease remain elusive. AD is characterized not only by pathological hallmarks such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also by impairments in synaptic physiology, circuit activity and cognitive function. Synaptic homeostatic plasticity plays a vital role in maintaining the stability of synaptic and neural functions amid genetic and environmental disturbances. A key component of this regulation is presynaptic homeostatic potentiation, where increased presynaptic neurotransmitter release compensates for reduced postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, thereby stabilizing neuronal excitability. The role of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity in synapse stabilization in AD, however, remains unclear. Moreover, recent advances in transcriptomics have illuminated the complex roles of glial cells in regulating synaptic function in ageing brains and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the impact of AD-related abnormalities in glial signalling on synaptic homeostatic plasticity has not been fully delineated. This review discusses recent findings on how glial dysregulation in AD affects presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. There is increasing evidence that disrupted glial signalling, particularly through aberrant histone acetylation and transcriptomic changes in glia, compromises this plasticity in AD. Notably, the sphingosine signalling pathway has been identified as being protective in stabilizing synaptic physiology through epigenetic and homeostatic mechanisms, presenting potential therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",1
"Thymus is considered a non-functional remnant in adults, but some evidence suggest that it may harbor residual activity. Lung cancer patients represent the ideal model to study thymic residual activity, as their thymus can be easily harvested during surgery. This study was designed to confirm the presence of residual thymic activity both in adult mice (step 1) and in humans (step 2). In step 1, lung cancer was induced by activating k-ras mutation in a cohort of 20 young and adult mice. After killing, thymus and lungs were analyzed. Thymus was considered active when medullary was evident, cortico-medullary ratio was 50:50 or higher and adipose involution was present. In step 2, a cohort of 20 patients, undergoing surgery for lung cancer, had biopsy of pericardial fat pad, site of ectopic thymus. Thymus was considered present if Hassall’s bodies were detected. In mice, active thymus was detected in a high proportion of cases, without significant difference between adult and young (70% vs 44.4% respectively). Two cases without evidence of lung tumor had a fully functional thymus. In humans, ectopic thymus was detected in the pericardial fat pad in 2 cases (10.5%), confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Signs of previous thymic activity were detected in 8 additional patients. Results confirmed thymus activity in animal models and humans with lung cancer, providing the rationale for future systematic mediastinal thymic biopsy. The comprehension of interactions between thymus, lymphocytes and tumor may open a new potentially targetable perspective in lung cancer.","PurposeMitophagy and aging (MiAg) are very important pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to tumorigenesis. MiAg-related genes have prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, prognostic, and immune correlation studies of MiAg-related genes in LUAD are lacking.MethodsMiAg differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LUAD were obtained from public sequencing datasets. A prognostic model including MiAg DEGs was constructed according to patients divided into low- and high-risk groups. Gene Ontology, gene set enrichment analysis, gene set variation analysis, CIBERSORT immune infiltration analysis, and clinical characteristic correlation analyses were performed for functional annotation and correlation of MiAgs with prognosis in patients with LUAD.ResultsSeven MiAg DEGs of LUAD were identified: CAV1, DSG2, DSP, MYH11, NME1, PAICS, PLOD2, and the expression levels of these genes were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). The RiskScore of the MiAg DEG prognostic model demonstrated high predictive ability of overall survival of patients diagnosed with LUAD. Patients with high and low MiAg phenotypic scores exhibited significant differences in the infiltration levels of eight types of immune cells (P < 0.05). The multi-factor DEG regression model showed higher efficacy in predicting 5-year survival than 3- and 1-year survival of patients with LUAD.ConclusionsSeven MiAg-related genes were identified to be significantly associated with the prognosis of patients diagnosed with LUAD. Moreover, the identified MiAg DEGs might affect the immunotherapy strategy of patients with LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05390-x.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor with significant global health implications. The role of CD4+ T cells, particularly conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), in HCC progression remains unexplored. Furthermore, epigenetic factors are crucial in immune regulation, yet their specific role in HCC-infiltrating Tconv cells remains elusive. This study elucidates the role of MATR3, an epigenetic regulator, in modulating Tconv activity and immune evasion within the HCC microenvironment. Reanalysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed that early activation of CD4+ T cells is crucial for establishing an antitumor immune response. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that Tconv enhances cDC1-induced CD8+ T-cell activation. Screening identified MATR3 as a critical regulator of Tconv function, which is necessary for antitumour activity but harmful when overexpressed. Excessive MATR3 expression exacerbates Tconv exhaustion and impairs function by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to relax chromatin in the TOX promoter region, leading to aberrant transcriptional changes. In summary, MATR3 is an HCC-specific epigenetic checkpoint that bidirectionally regulates Tconv antitumour immunity, suggesting new therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic regulators to enhance antitumour immunity in HCC.","PurposeGiven that prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differs dramatically, it is imperative to uncover effective and available prognostic biomarker(s). The intratumor microbiome plays a significant role in the response to tumor microenvironment, we aimed to identify an intratumor microbiome signature for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients accurately and investigate its possible mechanisms subsequently.MethodsThe TCGA HCC microbiome data (TCGA-LIHC-microbiome) was downloaded from cBioPortal. To create an intratumor microbiome-related prognostic signature, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to quantify the association of microbial abundance and patients’ overall survival (OS), as well as their diseases specific survival (DSS). The performance of the scoring model was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Based on the microbiome-related signature, clinical factors, and multi-omics molecular subtypes on the basis of “icluster” algorithm, nomograms were established to predict OS and DSS. Patients were further clustered into three subtypes based on their microbiome-related characteristics by consensus clustering. Moreover, deconvolution algorithm, weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to investigate the potential mechanisms.ResultsIn TCGA LIHC microbiome data, the abundances of 166 genera among the total 1406 genera were considerably associated with HCC patients’ OS. From that filtered dataset we identified a 27-microbe prognostic signature and developed a microbiome-related score (MRS) model. Compared with those in the relatively low-risk group, patients in higher-risk group own a much worse OS (P < 0.0001). Besides, the time-dependent ROC curves with MRS showed excellent predictive efficacy both in OS and DSS. Moreover, MRS is an independent prognostic factor for OS and DSS over clinical factors and multi-omics-based molecular subtypes. The integration of MRS into nomograms significantly improved the efficacy of prognosis prediction (1-year AUC:0.849, 3-year AUC: 0.825, 5-year AUC: 0.822). The analysis of microbiome-based subtypes on their immune characteristics and specific gene modules inferred that the intratumor microbiome may affect the HCC patients’ prognosis via modulating the cancer stemness and immune response.ConclusionMRS, a 27 intratumor microbiome-related prognostic model, was successfully established to predict HCC patients overall survive independently. And the possible underlying mechanisms were also investigated to provide a potential intervention strategy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04962-1.",0
"PurposeThis phase II trial is designed to test whether the performance status (PS) of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients (pts) can improve with chemotherapy if their poor PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of ≥ 2) is due to disease burden rather than comorbidities.MethodsAge18–65 years, Charlson’s comorbidity index < 9, serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dl, adequate bone marrow and organ function, & ECOG PS ≥ 2 as judged by the worst score of three independent physicians were administered 3 doses of weekly paclitaxel at 60 mg/m2/dose. The primary endpoint was an improvement in ECOG PS by 1 point at 4 weeks; others: toxicity (CTCAE v 5.0), quality of life (QoL) assessment at baseline and 4 weeks by EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13. Optimal Simon’s 2-stage design was used.Results Forty-six patients were included with a median age of 56 years (interquartile range, IQR 54–59), 12 (26%) had comorbid conditions, and 87% with ECOG PS 3/4. PS improved in 11 pts at 4 weeks and in 7 beyond this time point. Grade 3/4 toxicities are seen in 20% (most common: anemia and diarrhea). At a median follow-up of 4.8 m (95% CI 3.27–14.9), the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.3 months (95% CI 2.36–5.6) and 6.8 months (95% CI 2.47–8.8), respectively. QoL improved for global QoL, role functioning, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, pain in the chest, pain in other parts, and worsened for alopecia and sore mouth.Conclusions Abbreviated chemotherapy is a useful, well-tolerated strategy in carefully selected poor PS mNSCLC patients that can improve PS and QoL.Clinical trialClinical trial information: CTRI/2020/01/022617.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04617-1.","Advances in biomarker-driven therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) provide both opportunities to improve the treatment and thus outcomes for patients and pose new challenges for equitable care delivery.

"Local and systemic immunosuppression are prominent features of pancreatic cancer, rendering anti-tumor effector cells inactive and immunotherapeutic approaches ineffective. The spleen, an understudied point of antigen-presentation and T cell priming in humans, holds particular importance in pancreatic cancer due to its proximity to the developing tumor. As main effectors of antigen presentation, dendritic cells display antigens to lymphocytes, thereby bridging the innate and adaptive immune response. While tumor-infiltrating anti-inflammatory dendritic cells have been described, splenic dendritic cells have historically just been considered to stimulate the anti-tumor immune response. Here, we describe, for the first time, the presence of an immunosuppressive, tolerogenic IDO1+ dendritic cell subset in the spleens of pancreatic cancer patients that likely contributes to systemic immunosuppression that is associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Network analysis of scRNA seq data reveals extensive communication networks between the identified tolerogenic DC cluster and numerous immune cell populations in the spleen. Interactions with innate and adaptive immune cells suggest a broad influence on leukocyte trafficking and immune regulation within the spleen microenvironment. The identification of signaling pathways involving AHR and IDO-1, CCL19, NECTIN2, CLEC2D, and others elucidates potential mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive functions of this cell type.","Background and Aims:Ambiguous understanding of tumors and tumor microenvironments (TMEs) hinders accurate diagnosis and available treatment for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) covering intrahepatic metastasis (IM) and multicentric occurrence (MO). Here, we characterized the diverse TMEs of IM and MO identified by whole-exome sequencing at single-cell resolution.Approach and Results:We performed parallel whole-exome sequencing and scRNA-seq on 23 samples from 7 patients to profile their TMEs when major results were validated by immunohistochemistry in the additional cohort. Integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing found that malignant cells in IM showed higher intratumor heterogeneity, stemness, and more activated metabolism than those in MO. Tumors from IM shared similar TMEs while distinct TMEs were noticed in those from MO. Furthermore, CD20+ B cells, plasma cells, and conventional type II dendritic cells (cDC2s) were decreased in IM relative to MO while T cells in IM exhibited a more terminally exhausted capacity with a higher proportion of proliferative/exhausted T cells than that in MO. Both CD20 and CD1C correlated with better prognosis in multifocal HCC. Additionally, MMP9+ tumor-associated macrophages were enriched across IM and MO, which formed cellular niches with regulatory T cells and proliferative/exhausted T cells.Conclusions:Our findings deeply decipher the heterogeneous TMEs between IM and MO, which provide a comprehensive landscape of multifocal HCC.",1
"ResumenLas enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales son entidades crónicas con manifestaciones y evolución heterogéneas, por lo que constituyen un desafío diagnóstico y terapéutico. En los últimos años se han producido cambios trascendentales en el manejo de las enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales, de la mano del mayor conocimiento de su inmunofisiopatología y evolución a largo plazo. A diferencia de otras enfermedades, la clínica no es soberana y debemos respaldarnos en parámetros más certeros de inflamación para la toma de decisiones. Con el advenimiento de nuevas herramientas bioquímicas, de imágenes y endoscópicas, el enfoque actual está dirigido a lograr un menor retraso en el diagnóstico y un monitoreo estrecho de la curación mucosa como una de las metas fundamentales asociada a una evolución favorable. El objetivo de esta revisión es actualizar los nuevos conceptos respecto a estrategias diagnósticas y de monitoreo en las enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales.","Introduction:The cell cycle cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a critical role in controlling the transition between cell cycle phases, as well as cellular transcription. Aberrant CDK activation is common in cancer, and deregulation of the cell cycle a key hallmark of cancer. Although CDK4/6 inhibitors are now a standard-of-care option for first- and second-line HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, resistance inevitably limits their clinical benefit.Areas covered:Early pan-CDK inhibitors targeted the cell cycle and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, but were complicated by toxicity, providing a rationale and need for the development of selective CDK inhibitors. In this review, we highlight selected recent literature to provide a narrative review summarizing the current CDK inhibitor therapeutic landscape. We detail the challenges associated with targeting CDKs for the treatment of breast and other cancers and review emerging biomarkers that may aid response prediction. We also discuss the risk-benefit ratio for CDK therapy and explore promising combination approaches.Expert opinion:Although CDK inhibitors may stem the proliferation of cancer cells, resistance remains an issue, and currently there are limited biomarkers to predict response to therapy. Ongoing research investigating CDK inhibitors in cancer is of paramount importance to define appropriate and effective treatment regimens.",1
"AbstractBackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a strong risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing hospitalization for COVID-19 with VTE.MethodsAdults hospitalized at 21 sites between March 2021 and October 2022 with symptoms of acute respiratory illness were assessed for COVID-19, completion of the original monovalent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination series, and VTE. Prevalence of VTE was compared between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients with COVID-19. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was calculated using a test-negative design. The VE was also stratified by predominant circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant.ResultsAmong 18 811 patients (median age [interquartile range], 63 [50–73] years; 49% women; 59% non-Hispanic white, 20% non-Hispanic black, and 14% Hispanic; and median of 2 comorbid conditions [interquartile range, 1–3]), 9792 were admitted with COVID-19 (44% vaccinated), and 9019 were test-negative controls (73% vaccinated). Among patients with COVID-19, 601 had VTE diagnosed by hospital day 28, of whom 170 were vaccinated. VTE was more common among unvaccinated than vaccinated patients with COVID-19 (7.8% vs 4.0%; P = .001). The VE against COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was 84% overall (95% confidence interval, 80%–87%), and VE stratified by predominant circulating variant was 88% (73%–95%) for Alpha, 93% (90%–95%) for Delta, and 68% (58%–76%) for Omicron variants.ConclusionsVaccination with the original monovalent mRNA series was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE, though data detailing prior history of VTE and use of anticoagulation were not available. These findings will inform risk-benefit considerations for those considering vaccination.","PurposeProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression may influence the prognosis of patients with localized esophageal cancer. The current study compared the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression between tumor cells and immune cells.MethodsArchival esophageal tumor tissue samples were collected from patients who received paclitaxel and cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in three prospective phase II trials. PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells was examined immunohistochemically by using the SP142 antibody and scored by two independent pathologists. The association of PD-L1 expression with patient’s outcomes was analyzed using a log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis.ResultsA total of 100 patients were included. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was positive (≥ 1%, TC-positive) in 55 patients; PD-L1 expression on immune cells was high (≥ 5%, IC-high) in 30 patients. TC-positive status was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.63, P = 0.035), whereas IC-high status was associated with improved OS (HR: 0.44, P = 0.0024). Multivariate analysis revealed that TC-positive, IC-high, and performance status were independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival and that IC-high and performance status were independent factors for OS. Furthermore, the combination of IC-high and TC-negative status was associated with the optimal OS, whereas that of TC-positive and IC-low status was associated with the worst OS.ConclusionPD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells may have different prognostic value for patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving neoadjuvant CRT. A combination of these two indexes may further improve the prognostic prediction.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03772-7.",0
"Changes in gut flora are associated with liver fibrosis. The interactions of host with intestinal flora are still unknown, with little research investigating such interactions with comprehensive multi-omics data. The present work analyzed and integrated large-scale multi-omics transcriptomics, microbiome, metabolome, and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from Kaempferol-treated and untreated control groups by advanced bioinformatics methods. This study concludes that kaempferol dose-dependently improved serum markers (like AST, ALT, TBil, Alb, and PT) and suppressed fibrosis markers (including HA, PC III, LN, α-SMA, and Collagen I), while kaempferol also increased body weight. Mechanistically, kaempferol improved the metabolic levels of intestinal flora dysbiosis and associated lipids. This was achieved by increasing the abundance of g__Robinsoniella, g__Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003, g__Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002, and 5-Methylcytidine, all-trans-5,6- Epoxyretinoic acid, LPI (18:0), LPI (20:4), etc. to achieve this. Kaemferol exerts anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects by down-regulating the Th17/IL-17 signaling pathway in PDGF-induced LX2 cells. In addition, kaempferol administration remarkably elevated CD4 + T and CD8 + T cellular proportions, thereby activating immune cells for protecting the body and controlling inflammatory conditions. The combined interaction of multiple data may explain how Kaempferol modulates the intestinal flora thereby remodeling the hepatocyte population and alleviating liver fibrosis.Graphical Abstract","Mutations in the TSC (tuberous sclerosis complex) genes result in the hyperactivation of the mTORC1 (mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin 1) growth pathway in mesenchymal pulmonary cells. Rapamycin (sirolimus), a naturally occurring macrolide, is the only therapeutic approved for women with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a progressive, destructive lung disease caused by TSC gene mutations and mTORC1 hyperactivation. However, on cessation of the drug, lung function decline continues. We demonstrated here that pulmonary LAM cancer stem-like state (SLS) cells most highly expressed the eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E)-dependent translation initiation genes. We also showed that the 4E-BP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1) gene has the lowest expression in these cells, indicating that the 4E-BP1/eIF4E ratio in LAM SLS cells favors unrestrained eIF4E oncogenic mRNA translation. The bi-steric mTORC1-selective compound RMC-5552 prevented growth of LAM-associated fibroblasts and phosphorylation of proteins in the ribosomal protein S6K1/ribosomal protein S6 (S6K1/S6) and 4E-BP1/eIF4E translation mTORC1-driven pathways, whereas rapamycin only blocked the S6K/S6 axis. Rapamycin inhibition of LAM-associated fibroblast growth was rapidly reversed, but RMC-5552 inhibition was more durable. RMC-5552, through its potential to eradicate LAM cancer SLS cells, may have therapeutic benefit in LAM and other diseases with mTORC1 hyperactivity.",0
"Aim: Wilms’ tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP), plays a part in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, it is not yet known how WTAP affects cancer progression by influencing leukocyte rich repeat containing proteins (NLR) – family members 3 (NLRP3) – related inflammasomes.Materials & methods: We first validated the expression of WTAP in CRC at the tissue and cellular levels. Subsequently, by transfecting si-NC and si-WTAP into cells, we verified functions of WTAP in proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of CRC cells. Finally, we analyzed the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of NLRP3 by WTAP using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR technology, confirming that WTAP mediated the repression of NLRP3 inflammasome and the malignant progression of tumor cells.Results: WTAP was substantially upregulated in CRC tissues and cells. WTAP reinforced the migration, proliferation and invasion ability of CRC cells, and repressed apoptosis. Mechanistically, WTAP mediated the m6A modification of NLRP3, which suppressed the expression of NLRP3 and dampened the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis activation as well as pyroptosis, thereby facilitating the malignant progression of CRC.Conclusion: WTAP mediates m6A modification to modulate the repression of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis in pyroptosis, reinforcing the malignant progression of CRC.","Innate immunity, cell death and inflammation underpin many aspects of health and disease. Upon sensing pathogens, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or alarmins, the innate immune system activates inflammatory cell death, such as pyroptosis and PANoptosis. These genetically-defined, regulated cell death pathways not only contribute to the host defense against infectious disease, but also promote pathological manifestations leading to cancer and inflammatory diseases. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms has grown rapidly in recent years. However, how dying cells, cell corpses, and their liberated cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory signalling molecules are further sensed by innate immune cells, and their contribution to further amplify inflammation, trigger antigen presentation, and activate adaptive immunity, is less clear. Here, we discuss how pattern-recognition and PANoptosome sensors in innate immune cells recognize and respond to cell-death signatures. We also highlight molecular targets of the innate immune response for potential therapeutic development.",1
"Background and aims:Knowledge about the association between oral microbiome diversity within individuals and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortality is scarce. Besides, variation by sex and racial and ethnic groups, and the potential mediators of these associations remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations of oral microbiome alpha diversity with all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality, and the interaction effects of sex and racial and ethnic groups and potential mediators in the associations.Methods:The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a population-based observational study, conducted periodically in Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, and other racial/ethnic participants. We linked 2009–12 survey data of 8,199 adults to the mortality data until 2019. By analyzing RNA gene sequences from oral rinse samples, microbiome alpha diversity within individuals was assessed using operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness. Potential mediators included obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and periodontitis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression and causal mediation analysis were used.Results:Baseline mean±standard deviation (SD) age was 42.1±15.1 years. Over a median follow-up of 9.1 years, 405 all-cause mortality occurred (CVD, 105; non-CVD, 300). Each 1-SD increment in OTU richness was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–0.95), CVD mortality (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90–0.95), and non-CVD mortality (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90–0.95). With evidence of significant racial and ethnic groups-interaction (P ˂0.05), these associations were evident in Mexican American, NH White, and others racial/ethnic participants. None of the potential mediators significantly mediated the associations of OTU richness with all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality.Conclusions:Lower oral microbiome alpha diversity is associated with higher risk for all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality, and the associations are varied by racial and ethnic groups.","PurposeThe applications of liposomes are limited due to poor structural stability and short drug circulation time. This study aims to build an albumin-based liposomal delivery system to provide strategies for tumor specificity, efficient gene delivery and effective release of albumin liposomes.MethodsIn this study, siRNA loaded PDL1-targeted albumin liposome was constructed for the treatment of lung cancer and its function was evaluated. Physical parameters such as particle size, potential and infrared spectrum were detected and microscopic morphology was observed by electron microscopy to detect the binding and uptake capacity of albumin liposome with cells. The optimal preparation process and binding ratio of PDL1-targeted albumin liposome/siRNA complex were determined.ResultsThe constructed siRNA loaded PDL1-targeted albumin liposomes has low toxicity, high loading rate and tumor cell targeted gene therapy ability. Moreover, it increased T cell activation and down-regulated siRNA expression, effectively realizing the inhibition of lung cancer cells.ConclusionThe results showed that the PDL1-targeted albumin liposome could be used as a high efficient delivery vector of siRNA, and was a high efficient and safe nano vector for tumor targeted gene therapy.",0
"ObjectivesThis study aims to develop and validate a prognostic signature based on 7-methylguanosine-related (M7G-related) miRNAs for predicting prognosis and immune implications in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA).Materials and methodsM7G-related miRNA data of BRCA were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized, univariate, and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct the prognostic signature. Furthermore, the predictive validity was verified using Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival risk and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Internal random sampling verification was used to simplify and validate the signature. RT-qPCR was used to quantify the expression level of transcriptional profiles. The independent prognostic role of the risk score was validated using univariate and multivariate regression. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was used for functional and immune enrichment analysis.ResultsA total of 18 M7G-related miRNAs were identified to construct the prognostic signature in BRCA. The low-risk group exhibited significantly higher overall survival than the high-risk group in the KM survival plot (P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals in the ROC curve were 0.737, 0.724, and 0.702, respectively. The survival significance in the training and testing cohorts was confirmed by random sampling verification. The most prominent miRNAs in the signature were the miR-7, miR-139, miR-10b, and miR-4728. Furthermore, immune scores for B, mast, and Th1 cells varied between risk groups. Our research demonstrated that CD52 was the most positively correlated gene with immune cells and functions in BRCA.ConclusionOur study presents a comprehensive and systematic analysis of M7G-related miRNAs to construct a prognostic signature in BRCA. The signature demonstrated excellent prognostic validity, with the risk score as an independent prognostic factor. These results provide critical evidence for further investigation of M7G miRNAs and offer new insights for BRCA patients in the context of effective immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04849-1.","IntroductionThymomas are uncommon tumors that originate from epithelial cells of thymus and may have varying clinical course.Materials and MethodsA retrospective review of medical records of thymoma patients treated between January 2012 and April 2022 at our institute was conducted.Results There were a total of 23 patients (12 males and 11 females) with median age of 52 years (range, 33–77 years). Eleven patients (47.8%) had associated paraneoplastic syndromes of which 10 (43.5%) had myasthenia gravis and 1 (4.3%) had pure red cell aplasia. Average maximal tumor diameter was 62 mm (28–160 mm). Masaoka-Koga stage distribution was as follows: stage I ( n = 2, 8.7%), IIA ( n = 4, 17.4%), IIB ( n = 1, 4.3%), IIIA ( n = 2, 8.7%), IIIB ( n = 4, 17.4%), IVA ( n = 7, 30.4%), and IVB ( n = 3, 13.1%). The World Health Organization type B2 was the commonest histology ( n = 12, 52.17%), followed by B3 ( n =7, 30.4%), B1 ( n = 2, 8.7%), AB ( n = 1,4.3%), and A ( n = 1, 4.3%). Six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide regimen, 22 (95.6%) underwent surgery, and 1 patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. R0 resection was attained in 20 (91%) patients, R1 resection in 1 (4.5%) patient, and R2 in 1 (4.5%) patient. All operated patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy (45–60 Gy in 25–30 fractions). Four patients relapsed at a median duration of 14 months (2–26 months). At a median follow-up of 6 years, 5-year overall survival was 67.1% and 5-year progression-free survival was 66.6%. Local control at 5 years was 86.6%. ConclusionDespite majority of our patients presenting at an advanced stage, the local control rates are encouraging and reinforce multimodality approach.",0
"With significant advancements of next generation sequencing technologies, large amounts of multi-omics data, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have been accumulated, offering an unprecedented opportunity to explore the heterogeneity and complexity of cancer across various molecular levels and scales. One of the promising aspects of multi-omics lies in its capacity to offer a holistic view of the biological networks and pathways underpinning cancer, facilitating a deeper understanding of its development, progression, and response to treatment. However, the exponential growth of data generated by multi-omics studies present significant analytical challenges. Processing, analyzing, integrating, and interpreting these multi-omics datasets to extract meaningful insights is an ambitious task that stands at the forefront of current cancer research. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful solution to these challenges, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in deciphering complex patterns and extracting valuable information from large-scale, intricate omics datasets. This review delves into the synergy of AI and multi-omics, highlighting its revolutionary impact on oncology. We dissect how this confluence is reshaping the landscape of cancer research and clinical practice, particularly in the realms of early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and pathology. Additionally, we elaborate the latest AI methods for multi-omics integration to provide a comprehensive insight of the complex biological mechanisms and inherent heterogeneity of cancer. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of data harmonization, algorithm interpretability, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges necessitates a multidisciplinary collaboration, paving the promising way for more precise, personalized, and effective treatments for cancer patients.","Aim: This study investigated the role of lncRNA LINC01232 in ferroptosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials & methods: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blot experiments were performed to examine relevant mRNAs and proteins expression. The kit assays evaluated malondialdehyde, iron, Fe2+ and glutathione levels. ROS levels were verified by flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation analysis monitored the correlation among LINC01232, H3K27ac, p300 and ARNTL2.Results: LINC01232 or ARNTL2 knockdown facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis. The interaction between LINC01232 and p300 resulted in the enhancement of H3K27ac levels at ARNTL2 promoter to promote ARNTL2 transcriptional activity. ARNTL2 overexpression reversed the promoting effect of LINC01232 knockdown on ferroptosis.Conclusion: LINC01232 inhibited the ferroptosis in CRC by epigenetically upregulating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL2.",0
"Despite the notable efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, resistance in most individuals necessitates additional investigation. For this study, we collected tumor tissues from nine HCC patients receiving anti-PD1 monotherapy and conducted RNA sequencing. These findings revealed significant upregulation of GSDME, which is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in anti-PD1-resistant patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated levels of GSDME+ macrophages in HCC tissues presented a poorer prognosis. The analysis of single-cell sequencing data and flow cytometry revealed that the suppression of GSDME expression in nontumor cells resulted in a decrease in the proportion of M2-like macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TIME) of HCC while concurrently augmenting the cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells. The non-N-terminal fragment of GSDME within macrophages combines with PDPK1, thereby activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and facilitating M2-like polarization. The small-molecule Eliprodil inhibited the increase in PDPK1 phosphorylation mediated by GSDME site 1. The combination of Eliprodil and anti-PD1 was effective in the treatment of both spontaneous HCC in c-Myc + /+;Alb-Cre + /+ mice and in a hydrodynamic tail vein injection model, which provides a promising strategy for novel combined immunotherapy.","We present a case of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with metastasis to the right ventricle (RV) successfully treated through surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). A 50-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, prompting transthoracic echocardiography that revealed a mobile, irregular RV mass measuring 40 × 32 mm. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed masses in the RV and the right pulmonary artery, which was totally occluded. Emergency surgical resection of both masses was performed to avoid sudden death. Histopathological analysis confirmed squamous cell carcinoma; however, the primary origin of the masses remained unidentified despite extensive evaluations, including positron emission tomography-CT. The final diagnosis was SCCUP. Immunohistochemistry indicated positive programmed cell death ligand 1, and postoperative chemotherapy with an ICI was administered. One year post-surgery, the patient remains healthy with no sign of recurrence.Learning objectiveThis case shows the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with cardiac metastasis through emergency surgery and postoperative immunotherapy. Despite the poor prognosis associated with cardiac metastatic malignant tumors and the lack of established treatment guidelines, this case highlights the potential benefits of surgical intervention and the efficacy of immunotherapy in managing cardiac metastatic SCCUP, with the patient remaining with no recurrence one-year post-surgery.",1
"Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rather frequent, little is known about the molecular pathways underlying its development, progression, and prognosis. In the current study, we comprehensively analyzed the deferentially expressed metabolism-related genes (MRGs) in HCC based on TCGA datasets attempting to discover the potentially prognostic genes in HCC. The up-regulated MRGs were further subjected to analyze their prognostic values and protein expressions. Twenty-seven genes were identified because their high expressions were significant in OS, PFS, DFS, DSS, and HCC tumor samples. They were then used for GO, KEGG, methylation, genetics changes, immune infiltration analyses. Moreover, we established a prognostic model in HCC using univariate assays and LASSO regression based on these MRGs. Additionally, we also found that SLC38A1, an amino acid metabolism closely related transporter, was a potential prognostic gene in HCC, and its function in HCC was further studied using experiments. We found that the knockdown of SLC38A1 notably suppressed the growth and migration of HCC cells. Further studies revealed that SLC38A1 modulated the development of HCC cells by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling via glutamine mediated energy metabolism. In conclusion, this study identified the potentially prognostic MRGs in HCC and uncovered that SLC38A1 regulated HCC development and progression by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling via glutamine mediated energy metabolism, which might provide a novel marker and potential therapeutic target in HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05360-3.","Context:About half of adolescents aged 13 to 17 in United States are not fully vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV). As they age into young adulthood, colleges may be an excellent target population nexus for implementing interventions to improve HPV vaccination uptake.Objectives:Our study goal was to generate knowledge about HPV vaccine offerings and awareness programs at colleges to ascertain the extent of campus-facilitated access to HPV immunization and education in 1 state.Design:An electronic survey was designed and emailed to 32 of 47 Maryland colleges for which relevant campus contacts could be identified.Settings:The study took place at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in consultation with the Maryland Cancer Collaborative and the Maryland Department of Health.Participants:Maryland colleges and universitiesMain Outcome Measures:HPV vaccine and awareness program offerings on college and university campuses.Results:Twenty Maryland colleges responded. Two colleges offer awareness programs only. Ten colleges offer HPV vaccine, covering about 39% of Maryland college students. Of these, 4 colleges schedule “periodic” campus health clinics or provide an immunization prescription, which is filled at nearby pharmacies. In all colleges, which offer HPV vaccine, immunization is offered to everyone (both men and women) at no out-of-pocket cost.Conclusions:In cooperation with the Maryland Cancer Collaborative, the implementation arm for the Maryland Cancer Control Plan, we showed that college campuses are an excellent target site for implementation of interventions to improve access of college age students to HPV vaccine and awareness programs. We lay the groundwork for recommendations, programs and policies that can improve HPV vaccine offerings among college students thus raising the HPV vaccination rate in young adults. Simple inexpensive alternatives to offering vaccine at college health centers may be periodic campus health clinics and arrangements with nearby pharmacies.",0
"Conventional forms of noninvasive cardiovascular imaging that evaluate morphology, function, flow, and metabolism play a vital role in individual treatment decisions, often based on guidelines. Innovations in molecular imaging have enhanced our ability to spatially quantify the expression of a wider array of disease-related proteins, genes, or cell types, or the activity of specific pathogenic pathways. These techniques, which usually rely on design of targeted imaging probes, have already been used extensively in cancer medicine and have now become part of cardiovascular care in conditions such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis. The recognition that common cardiovascular conditions are caused by a substantial diversity of pathobiologic pathways and the diversity of therapies available for use have rekindled interest in expanding the role of molecular imaging of tissue phenotype to improve precision in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making. The intent of this article is to raise awareness and understanding of approaches to molecular or cellular imaging of phenotype with targeted probes, and their potential to promote the principles of precision medicine. Also addressed are the diverse roles of molecular imaging to improve precision and efficiency of new drug development at the stages of candidate identification, preclinical testing, and clinical trials.","Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid for the growth and survival of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Many cancers are addicted to glutamine, and as a result, targeting glutamine metabolism has been explored clinically as a therapeutic approach. Glutamine-catalyzing enzymes are highly expressed in primary and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the nature of the glutamine-associated pathways in this aggressive cancer type has not been elucidated. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential of a broad glutamine antagonist, DRP-104 (sirpiglenastat), in HNSCC tumors and aimed at shedding light on glutamine-dependent pathways in this disease. We observed a potent antitumoral effect of sirpiglenastat in HPV- and HPV+ HNSCC xenografts. We conducted a whole-genome CRISPR screen and metabolomics analyses to identify mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to glutamine metabolism blockade. These approaches revealed that glutamine metabolism blockade results in the rapid buildup of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via autophagy nutrient-sensing pathways. Finally, our analysis demonstrated that GPX4 mediates the protection of HNSCC cells from accumulating toxic lipid peroxides; hence, glutamine blockade sensitizes HNSCC cells to ferroptosis cell death upon GPX4 inhibition. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of sirpiglenastat in HNSCC and establish a novel link between glutamine metabolism and ferroptosis, which may be uniquely translated into targeted glutamine-ferroptosis combination therapies.",1
"PurposeWe aimed to establish the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) in the East Asian population.MethodsOverall survival (OS) and intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to determine prognostic factors associated with intracranial PFS and OS.ResultsBetween July 2007 and December 2019, 431 patients diagnosed with MBM were enrolled. Mucosal subtype (p = 0.013), LDH level (p = 0.014), the number of MBM ≥ 4 (p = 0.02), local treatment (p < 0.0001) and the use of PD-1 inhibitors (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for intracranial PFS. Mucosal subtype (p = 0.022), LDH level (p = 0.005), no extracranial metastasis (p = 0.01), concurrent liver metastasis (p = 0.004), local treatment (p = 0.001) and the use of PD-1 inhibitors (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for OS. Mucosal subtype brain metastases had a poor response to PD-1 inhibitors (p = 0.007), with a shorter intracranial PFS than other subtypes. In BRAF mutation patients with MBM, the first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy group had an advantage in OS compared to the first-line anti-PD-1 therapy group (p = 0.043).ConclusionOur findings depict clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of MBM in the East Asian population, suggesting the mucosal subtype as an adverse prognostic and predictive factor for patients with MBM. For BRAF mutation patients with MBM, first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy may bring a potential survival benefit compared to first-line anti-PD-1 therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03563-0.","Multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), with chromosomal instability (CIN) playing a significant role. CRC is influenced by mutations in several important genes, including APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and SMYD4. The three molecular subtypes of this disease are CIN, MSI-H, and CIMP (CpG-island phenotype). p53 dysfunction and aberrant Wnt signalling are common characteristics of CRC carcinogenesis. Despite advances in conventional therapy, metastatic CRC remains difficult to treat due to toxicity and resistance. Theranostics for cancer could significantly benefit from nanotechnology, as it would enable more targeted, individualised care with fewer side effects. Utilising functionalized nanoparticles has enabled MRI-guided gene therapy, magnetic hyperthermia, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and photothermal/photodynamic therapy, thereby radically modifying the way cancer is treated. Active targeting using ligands or peptides on nanoparticles improves the delivery of drugs to cancer cells. Nanostructures such as drug peptide conjugates, chitosan nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous silica-based nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles, hybrid lipid–polymer nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, and quantum dots may enable targeted drug delivery and enhanced therapeutic efficacy against CRC. Nanomedicines are presently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of colorectal cancer, with the promise of more effective and individualised therapies. This article examines current nanomedicine patents for CRC, including the work of Delta-Fly, Merrimack, and Pfenning, Meaning & Partner, among others. In terms of future nanomedicine research and development, ligand production, particle size, and clearance are crucial factors. Lastly, the numerous nanostructures utilized in nanomedicine for targeted drug administration and diagnostics indicate optimistic prospects for enhancing CRC treatment. The successes of nanomedicine research and development for existing colon cancer treatments are also highlighted in this review.Graphical abstract",1
"Real-time monitoring of dynamic biological processes in the body is critical to understanding disease progression and treatment response. This data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy. However, current clinical imaging modalities lack the molecular contrast, resolution, and chronic usability for rapid and accurate response assessments. Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a 2.5×5 mm2 CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue. The sensor operates wirelessly via ultrasound (US) at 5 cm depth in oil, harvesting energy with 221 mW/cm2 incident US power density (31% of FDA limits) and backscattering data at 13 kbps with a bit error rate <10−6. In-situ fluorescence excitation is provided by microlaser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical frontend combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate provides >6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A 36×40-pixel array captures images with <125μm resolution. We demonstrate wireless, dual-color fluorescence imaging of both effector and suppressor immune cells in ex vivo mouse tumor samples with and without immunotherapy. These results show promise for providing rapid insight into therapeutic response and resistance, guiding personalized medicine.","PurposeNeoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection is one of the preferred treatment option for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) factor exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutations, the use of MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed high efficiency and reduced toxicity compared with first-line standard chemotherapy. However, it is unknown whether preoperative induction targeted therapy of MET-TKIs is feasible and safe.MethodsHere, we reported 3 cases of locally advanced unresectable NSCLC with METex14 mutations receiving induction therapy of MET-TKI savolitinib as first-line therapy or second-line therapy when they experienced disease progression after preoperative chemotherapy.ResultsAll these 3 patients achieved significant tumor size shrinkage and their unresectable tumors became resectable after the treatment of savolitinib. No serious adverse events were observed during the treatment. They recovered well postoperatively, and no significant events were identified.ConclusionsPreoperative induction treatment with MET-TKI savolitinib showed its safety and effectiveness and may be an alternative option for neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC patients with METex14 mutations.",0
"Background and ObjectivesTo assess mismatch repair (MMR) status and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix and their association with clinicopathologic parameters.Material and MethodsExpression of PD-L1 and MMR status (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2) was assessed on 50 cases of SCCs of the cervix by immunohistochemistry.Results80% of tumor cells and 84% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed PD-L1 expression. 80% of cases had a combined positive score (CPS) of > 1, whereas 20% had a CPS of < 1. 94% of cases showed pMMR proteins, while 6% showed dMMR. 94% of the SCCs were HPV associated, and 6% were HPV-independent. All HPV-independent SCCs of the cervix showed PD-L1 expression, and all HPV-associated SCCs showed MMR deficiency. Between PD-L1 expression in the tumor and the grade of the tumor, a statistically significant association was noted (p = 0.022). All MMR-deficient SCCs were HPV-independent.ConclusionThis research highlighted the HPV association in cervical SCCs in the Indian population. Most of the cervical SCCs were HPV-associated. Furthermore, most of the HPV-associated SCCs were MMR stable. This study found no significant association between MMR status and PD-L1 expression in cervical SCCs.","Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer that reflects the increased energetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferating cancer cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that many aspects of tumor metabolism in vivo differ from those of cancer cells in culture, and that the tumor microenvironment plays a major role in driving these differences. Apart from cancer cells, tumors are composed of diverse cell types including vascular cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Nutrient sharing and competition between different cell types and access to nutrients in tumor tissue are not well modeled in standard monoculture systems. Tumors can also interact with whole body metabolism and share nutrients with peripheral tissues such as fat and muscle. Hence, studying some aspects of cancer metabolism in mouse models is useful for examining the complex metabolic interactions between cells and tissues. In this article, we discuss how advances in mouse modeling have enabled studies of tumor metabolism in vivo, providing insight into metabolic factors that influence cancer cell behavior in the physiological context of a whole organism. These studies are providing insight into how to leverage altered cancer metabolism for improved therapy.",0
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.","Host defense against viral pathogens is an essential function for all living organisms. In cell-intrinsic innate immunity, dedicated sensor proteins recognize molecular signatures of infection and communicate to downstream adaptor or effector proteins to activate immune defense. Remarkably, recent evidence demonstrates that much of the core machinery of innate immunity is shared across eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains of life. Here, we review a pioneering example of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity: the animal cGAS-STING signaling pathway and its ancestor in bacteria, CBASS anti-phage defense. We discuss the unique mechanism by which animal cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) and bacterial CD-NTases in these pathways link pathogen detection with immune activation using nucleotide second messenger signals. Comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we highlight emerging questions in the field and examine evolutionary pressures that may have shaped the origins of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense.",1
"Gastric malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are extremely rare spindle cell sarcomas that arise within the peripheral nerves of the gastrointestinal tract. MPNST can present as a mass that may or may not be accompanied by obstruction or bleeding. Type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an incidence of 1 in 2,500-3,000. Plexiform neurofibromas in Type 1 NF can undergo a malignant transformation to MPNSTs. Approximately half of the incidence of MPNST is associated with the NF-1 gene. MPNST behaves aggressively, and radical excisional surgery is important for treatment. Recurrence and metastasis are significant, even after a radical excision. Despite multidisciplinary treatment, the five-year survival rate is only 30-50%. This paper reports the case of a 47-year-old man with Type 1 NF who presented with hemorrhage of a gastric subepithelial lesion. He underwent surgery under the suspicion of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, but it was diagnosed as MPNST after confirming the histopathological appearance and immunohistochemical profiles. In addition, the large mass invaded the spleen and diaphragm. Radical surgery was performed, and additional chemotherapy was administered. This paper reports the experience of a patient with NF 1 with advanced MPNST discovered due to a subepithelial lesion.","PurposeKLHDC7B is a member of Kelch family, with a Kelch domain in the C-terminal half, which plays a role in various cellular events, such as cytoskeletal arrangement, protein degradation, gene expression. Although there is increasing evidence supporting KLHDC7B's vital role in tumorigenesis, a systematic analysis of KLHDC7B in cancers remains lacking. Therefore, we intended to investigate the prognostic value for KLHDC7B across 33 cancer types and explore its potential immunological function.MethodsGEO (Gene Expression Omnibus database) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atla) database were used to explore the role of KLHDC7B in 33 cancers. TIMER2, GEPIA2 and Kaplan–Meier plotter were utilized to explore the KLHDC7B expression level and prognostic value in different cancers. The pan cancer genetic variation and DNA methylation of KLHDC7B were analyzed by cBioPortal and MEXPRESS. TIMER2 was employed to investigate the correlation between KLHDC7B expression and immune infiltration. The relationship of KLHDC7B expression with TMB (tumor mutational burden) and MSI (microsatellite instability) were evaluated using Spearman correlation analysis. Finally, by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, the underlying mechanisms of KLHDC7B in tumor pathophysiology were further investigated.ResultsKLHDC7B expression level was related to pathological stages, MSI, TMB, immune checkpoint and immune cell infiltration in most cancers. Especially, we found that the KLHDC7B expression was negatively correlated with the immune infiltration of Myeloid derived suppressor cells into TGCT and GBM. Additionally, survival analysis showed that the expression of KLHDC7B was connected with overall survival (OS) in 3 cancers and disease-free survival (DFS) in 5 cancers. Furthermore, the enrichment analysis revealed that the KLHDC7B collecting genes and binding proteins are related to the function of proteins and immune response.ConclusionKLHDC7B demonstrates strong clinical utility as markers of prognostic and immune response in pan-cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04738-7.",0
"Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the most common type of Gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma with known complications such as bleeding, obstruction and perforation. In this article we present a 59-year-old male patient diagnosed with Peripheral T cell Lymphoma – Not Otherwise Specified (PTCL-NOS) with GI involvement was started on chemotherapy. On day 2 post completion of first cycle of chemotherapy, patient had presented to the emergency department with sudden onset abdominal pain and distension. On evaluation, he was diagnosed with multiple perforations in the small bowel. Patient underwent exploration with primary repair of few perforations and ileal resection with double barrel ileostomy. Chemotherapy plays an important role in the management of NHL. One well-known NHL consequence, intestinal perforation, can happen at the time of initial presentation or after starting chemotherapy. Surgeons should be aware of possibility of such complications and high-risk factors for perforation. At present, there is no role for elective surgery in GI lymphoma and is mainly reserved for complications like uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or perforation.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common form of brain cancer. Even with aggressive treatment, tumor recurrence is almost universal and patient prognosis is poor because many GBM cell subpopulations, especially the mesenchymal and glioma stem cell populations, are resistant to temozolomide (TMZ), the most commonly used chemotherapeutic in GBM. For this reason, there is an urgent need for the development of new therapies that can more effectively treat GBM. Several recent studies have indicated that high expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) in GBM is associated with poor patient outcomes. It has been hypothesized that inhibition of the Cx43 hemichannels could prevent TMZ efflux and sensitize otherwise resistance cells to the treatment. In this study, we use a three-dimensional organoid model of GBM to demonstrate that combinatorial treatment with TMZ and αCT1, a Cx43 mimetic peptide, significantly improves treatment efficacy in certain populations of GBM. Confocal imaging was used to visualize changes in Cx43 expression in response to combinatorial treatment. These results indicate that Cx43 inhibition should be pursued further as an improved treatment for GBM.",0
"BackgroundThe use of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with other anti-cancer agents was a priority for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with considerable PD-L1 expression. However, studies seldom show the progression of liver metastases after using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).MethodsData were obtained from the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care of Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Military Medical University. In the present study, we analyzed five non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had liver metastases after they were treated with pembrolizumab between 2019 and 2021. All of them had both stable primary lesions and liver progression with pembrolizumab intervention. Blood laboratory tests and imaging examinations were performed regularly during the treatment to assess the tumor responses of patients.ResultsAll patients displayed reduction or stability in the initial lesions as a result, but they also experienced the emergence of metastatic liver locations, which were regularly detected throughout immunotherapy. Additionally, the appearance of liver metastasis weakened their liver function gradually with the escalation of carcinoembryonic antigen, regarded as a predictor for evaluating the progression of tumors. These individuals were highly distinctive with hyper-progressive diseases associated with immunotherapy. We drew individualized intervention schemes for metastatic lesions in each patient and found that their life expectancy shared no significance given the restricting subjected population.ConclusionsOur study indicated a clinical phenomenon after using immune checkpoint inhibitors and presented a necessity for implementing large scales clinical studies to manage NSCLC-oriented liver metastasis.","A significant clinical challenge in lung cancer treatment is management of the inevitable acquired resistance to third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs), such as osimertinib, which have shown remarkable success in the treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations, in order to achieve maximal response duration or treatment remission. Apoptosis is a major type of programmed cell death tightly associated with cancer development and treatment. Evasion of apoptosis is considered a key hallmark of cancer and acquisition of apoptosis resistance is accordingly a key mechanism of drug acquired resistance in cancer therapy. It has been clearly shown that effective induction of apoptosis is a key mechanism for third generation EGFR-TKIs, particularly osimertinib, to exert their therapeutic efficacies and the development of resistance to apoptosis is tightly associated with the emergence of acquired resistance. Hence, restoration of cell sensitivity to undergo apoptosis using various means promises an effective strategy for the management of acquired resistance to third generation EGFR-TKIs.",0
"Background:Approximately 30% of cancer patients experience kidney complications, which hinder optimal cancer management, imposing a burden on patients’ quality of life and the healthcare system. The etiology of kidney complications in cancer patients is often attributed to oncological therapies. However, the direct impact of cancer on kidney health is underestimated. Our previous study demonstrated that metastatic lung cancer adversely alters the kidney, and exacerbates chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, indicating lung cancer-kidney crosstalk. The current study examines whether this phenomenon is specific to the employed cancer model.Methods:Female and male mice of various strains were injected with different cell lines of remote organ cancer, and their kidney tissues were analyzed for toxicity and fibrosis.Results:The impact of cancer on the kidney varied by cancer type. Breast cancer and specific subtypes of lung cancer, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant cancer, pathologically altered kidney physiology and function in a manner dependent on the metastatic potential of the cell line. This was independent of mouse strain, sex, and cancer cell line origin. Moreover, tumor DNA was not detected in the renal tissue, excluding metastases to the kidney as a causative factor for the observed pathological alterations. Lewis lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma did not cause nephrotoxicity, regardless of the tumor size.Conclusion:Our results confirm cancer-kidney crosstalk in specific cancer types. In the era of precision medicine, further research is essential to identify at-risk oncology populations, enabling early detection and management of renal complications.NEW & NOTEWORTHYCancer patients frequently experience kidney complications, often attributed to antineoplastic therapies. This emphasis on therapy-induced nephrotoxicity has led to the underestimation of the impact of cancer on the kidney. Our study demonstrates that distant organ cancer is sufficient to induce nephrotoxicity, highlighting the existence of cancer-kidney crosstalk. Our findings underscore a gap in our understanding of renal complications in cancer patients and provide a rationale for identifying the underlying mechanisms for the development of nephroprotective agents.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is now the stand of care for lung cancer. Due to the low incidence, the study of acute kidney injury (AKI) in lung cancer patients treated with ICIs was hardly reported. We focused on the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, and mortality of AKI in advanced lung cancer patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors.MethodsWe reviewed advanced lung cancer patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors between January 2018 to August 2020 at Jiangsu Province Hospital. Patients were followed up for 6 months. We used the logistic regression model to evaluate risk factors for AKI, and Kaplan–Meier method to assess the association between AKI and mortality.ResultsA total of 305 advanced lung cancer patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. The median age was 64 years and 80.6% of patients were male. The incidence of AKI was 10.2%, and the incidence of ICI-AKI was 4.6%. Multivariate analysis showed that concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (OR 2.509; 95% CI 1.053–5.974) and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (OR 2.656; 95% CI 1.091–6.466) were risk factors for AKI. In addition, concomitant use of NSAIDs (OR 5.170; 95% CI 1.087–24.595) and RAAS inhibitors (OR 5.921; 95% CI 1.871–18.737), and the occurrence of extra-renal immune-related adverse events (OR 4.726; 95% CI 1.462–15.280) were significantly associated with ICI-AKI. ICI-AKI was not associated with mortality while severe AKI was associated with higher risk of mortality.ConclusionAKI is common in advanced lung cancer patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. The characteristics and risk factors of ICI-AKI were similar to those previously reported in other solid organ malignancies treated with ICIs. Severe AKI may indicate higher mortality.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04437-9.",1
"BackgroundAURKA, Aurora kinase A encoding gene, is an important signaling hub gene for mitosis. In recent years, AURKA has been implicated in the occurrence and development of several cancers. However, its relationship with the tumor microenvironment in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects are still unclear.MethodWe adopted a variety of bioinformatics methods to comprehensively analyze the potential carcinogenesis of AURKA in SKCM, and constructed a prognostic nomogram model. We also dentified an inhibitor targeting AURKA and verified its therapeutic effects against SKCM using the molecular docking technology.ResultsWe found that abnormally high expression of AURKA was responsible for driving the occurrence and development of SKCM, and affected various pathological factors in SKCM. In addition, AURKA was established as an independent marker of poor SKCM prognosis. We also characterized the potential mechanisms by which AURKA manifests its effects in SKCM and found that AURKA inhibits the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and promotes hypoxia by activating the TGF-β signaling pathway. At the same time, the high AURKA expression group had higher tumor stemness index and promoted cell proliferation and metastasis. Finally, the small-molecule compound ZNC97018978 targeting AURKA screened by molecular docking technology can inhibit the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of SKCM. The possible mechanism is that ZNC97018978 induces apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation.ConclusionAURKA is the core hub gene driving the occurrence and development of SKCM, and its expression is regulated by epigenetic modifications. AURKA can regulate the infiltration level of various immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and apoptosis, and hypoxia. Thus, it is a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in SKCM. ZNC97018978 is an effective and safe inhibitor of AURKA in vitro; its safety and effectiveness in vivo as a potential treatment for cutaneous melanoma should be further determined.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04164-1.","BackgroundG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to have an important role in tumor development and metastasis, and abnormal expression of GPCRs is significantly associated with poor prognosis of tumor patients. In this study, we analyzed the GPCRs-related gene (GPRGs) and tumor microenvironment (TME) in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) to construct a prognostic model to help SKCM patients obtain accurate clinical treatment strategies.MethodsSKCM expression data and clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Differential expression analysis, LASSO algorithm, and univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were used to screen prognosis-related genes (GPR19, GPR146, S1PR2, PTH1R, ADGRE5, CXCR3, GPR143, and OR2I1P) and multiple prognosis-good immune cells; the data set was analyzed according to above results and build up a GPR-TME classifier. The model was further subjected to immune infiltration, functional enrichment, tumor mutational load, immunotherapy prediction, and scRNA-seq data analysis. Finally, cellular experiments were conducted to validate the functionality of the key gene GPR19 in the model.ResultsThe findings indicate that high expression of GPRGs is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with SKCM, highlighting the significant role of GPRGs and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in SKCM development. Notably, the group characterized by low GPR expression and a high TME exhibited the most favorable prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, cellular assays demonstrated that knockdown of GPR19 significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of melanoma cells in A375 and A2058 cell lines.ConclusionThis study provides novel insights for the prognosis evaluation and treatment of melanoma, along with the identification of a new biomarker, GPR19.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05486-4.",1
"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to compare response rates of lenvatinib and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, in first-line real-world setting.MethodsOverall cohort included Western and Eastern hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient populations from 46 centres in 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Japan, and Republic of Korea).Results1312 patients were treated with lenvatinib, and 823 patients were treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Objective response rate (ORR) was 38.6% for patients receiving lenvatinib, and 27.3% for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p < 0.01; odds ratio 0.60). For patients who achieved complete response (CR), overall survival (OS) was not reached in both arms, but the result from univariate Cox regression model showed 62% reduction of death risk for patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p = 0.05). In all multivariate analyses, treatment arm was not found to be an independent factor conditioning OS. Comparing ORR achieved in the two arms, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in all subgroups except for Eastern patients, Child–Pugh B patients, presence of portal vein thrombosis, α-feto-protein ≥ 400 ng/mL, presence of extrahepatic disease, albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2, and no previous locoregional procedures.ConclusionLenvatinib achieves higher ORR in all patient subgroups. Patients who achieve CR with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab can achieve OS so far never recorded in HCC patients. This study did not highlight any factors that could identify patient subgroups capable of obtaining CR.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04512-1.","IntroductionThe best first-line treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child–Pugh (CP) class B remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to perform a real-world analysis on a large sample of patients with unresectable HCC with CP B treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Vs Lenvatinib.MethodsThe study population included patients affected by advanced (BCLC-C) or intermediate (BCLC-B) HCC patients not suitable for locoregional therapies from both the Western and Eastern world (Italy, Germany, Republic of Korea and Japan), who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or Lenvatinib as first-line treatment. All the study population presented a CP class of B. The primary endpoint of the study was the overall survival (OS) of CP B patients treated with Lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Survival curves were estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan–Meier. The role of stratification factors was analyzed with log-rank tests. Finally, an interaction test was performed for the main baseline clinical characteristics.Results217 CP B HCC patients were enrolled in the study: 65 (30%) received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, and 152 (70%) received lenvatinib. The mOS for patients receiving Lenvatinib was 13.8 months (95% CI: 11.6–16.0), compared to 8.2 months (95% CI 6.3–10.2) for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Vs Lenvatinib: HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.0, p = 0.0050). No statistically significant differences were highlighted in terms of mPFS. The multivariate analysis confirmed that patients receiving Lenvatinib as first-line treatment have a significantly longer OS compared to patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.29–3.25, p = 0.0023). By evaluating the cohort of patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, we found that Child B patients with ECOG PS 0, or BCLC B stage or ALBI grade 1 were those who had benefited from the treatment thus showing survival outcomes no significantly different compared to those receiving Lenvatinib.ConclusionThe present study suggests for the first time a major benefit from Lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in a large cohort of patients with CP B class HCC.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain malignancy in adults. Standard of care (SOC) for suspected GBM begins with maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and maintenance temozolomide. Imvax has utilized its Goldspire™ platform to create IGV-001, an autologous biologic-device combination product for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM). IGV-001 consists of autologous GBM tumor cells and an antisense oligonucleotide against IGF-1R mRNA (IMV-001), irradiated and administered via biodiffusion chambers implanted in the abdomen. Together, these components stimulate immunogenic cell death and antigen release. In a phase 1b study in patients with ndGBM, IGV-001 was well tolerated without unexpected adverse events. Multiple efficacy signals were also observed, including significant improvements in progression-free survival, overall survival, radiographic evidence of tumor response, and changes in immune response biomarkers. A phase 2b randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of IGV-001 in patients with ndGBM (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04485949) is ongoing. Here, we present the first safety data from the study.MATERIAL AND METHODSAfter surgical resection, patients are treated with IGV-001 or placebo followed by SOC. The study will enroll approximately 93 patients at 20 sites in the United States, with a 2:1 randomization favoring IGV-001. The primary outcome is progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to first progression, as determined by blinded central radiology review, or death. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause, and safety.RESULTSAs of February 2, 2024, a total of 72 patients have been randomized and 69 have been implanted with IGV-001 or placebo plus SOC. The median age was 60.0 years (range, 24-70 years). Most randomized patients (76.4%) were 51-70 years of age, and the male:female ratio was 2.27. A total of 39/45 (86.7%) patients with enough follow-up time, initiated treatment with concurrent radiation and temozolomide. A total of 9/72 (12.5%) randomized patients discontinued treatment, including 7 patients who discontinued during the SOC treatment period. No patients discontinued treatment for adverse events, protocol deviations, or death. A total of 11/72 (15.3%) randomized patients discontinued the study after randomization.CONCLUSIONTo date, the review of blinded safety data did not show any emerging risk and supports that there is no change to the benefit-risk profile of treatment with IGV-001 versus placebo. The data will be updated before presentation.","AbstractGlioblastoma (GBM) remains to be one of the deadliest cancers with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. While immunotherapies have revolutionized the field for other cancers, GBM remains resistant to these types of interventions partly due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by accumulation of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify molecular targets for improve anti-tumorigenic T cell response. Previous studies in our laboratory identified dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an exopeptidase and a membrane-bound signaling receptor, as a potential marker of immunosuppression in GBM. While DPP-4 is well-drugged due to its role in insulin metabolism, the function of DPP-4 in immune regulation and cancer remains poorly defined. I observed that DPP-4 is highly expressed by CD8+ T cells GBM patients and preclinical models. Furthermore, DPP-4 levels increased with the exhaustion or memory differentiation of effector T cell. Pharmaceutical inhibition of DPP-4 enriched expression of genes related to lymphocyte activation and mitochondrial metabolism. These transcriptional changes were accompanied by enhanced T cell proliferation, cytotoxic function, and effector mediator production under exhaustion conditions. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 promotes anti-tumorigenic function of CD8+ T-cell by preventing exhaustion and support future translational efforts to repurpose DPP-4 inhibitors as immunotherapy agents in GBM, given their favorable safety profiles.",0
"AbstractVolume‐regulated anion channels (VRACs) are heteromeric complexes formed by proteins of the leucine‐rich repeat‐containing 8 (LRRC8) family. LRRC8A (also known as SWELL1) is the core subunit required for VRAC function, and it must combine with one or more of the other paralogues (that is LRRC8B–E) to form functional heteromeric channels. VRACs were discovered in T lymphocytes over 35 years ago and are found in virtually all vertebrate cells. Initially, these anion channels were characterized for their role in Cl− efflux during the regulatory volume decrease process triggered when cells are subjected to hypotonic challenges. However, substantial evidence suggests that VRACs also transport small molecules under isotonic conditions. These findings have expanded the research on VRACs to explore their functions beyond volume regulation. In innate immune cells, VRACs promote inflammation by modulating the transport of immunomodulatory cyclic dinucleotides, itaconate and ATP. In adaptive immune cells, VRACs suppress their function by taking up cyclic dinucleotides to activate the STING signalling pathway. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of LRRC8 proteins in immunity and discuss recent progress in their structure, function, regulation and mechanisms for channel activation and gating. Finally, we also examine potential immunotherapeutic applications of VRAC modulation.","AbstractAsthma exacerbation is a common clinical occurrence. The causal factors are not fully understood yet. Environmental pollution is linked to asthma exacerbation. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (MNP), an environmental pollutant, in asthma exacerbation. In this study, an airway allergy mouse model was established with ovalbumin as a specific antigen with or without the presence of MNP. The results showed that, in a mouse model, the intensity of airway allergy was significantly increased by exposure to MNP. RNAseq results showed an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated molecules and the Osm expression in airway epithelial cells of mice with airway allergy. Exposure of epithelial cells to MNP in culture induced the expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and ER stress associated molecules. The OSM receptor was expressed by macrophages. OSM could drive macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Inhibition of PERK, one of the key molecules of ER stress, or depletion of OSM receptor in macrophages, could effectively attenuate the MNP/ovalbumin protocol induced airway allergy. To sum up, by promoting ER stress, environmental pollutant MNP can cause airway epithelial cells to produce OSM. The latter induces macrophages to produce TNF-α, which can exacerbate airway allergy.",1
"Thymus is considered a non-functional remnant in adults, but some evidence suggest that it may harbor residual activity. Lung cancer patients represent the ideal model to study thymic residual activity, as their thymus can be easily harvested during surgery. This study was designed to confirm the presence of residual thymic activity both in adult mice (step 1) and in humans (step 2). In step 1, lung cancer was induced by activating k-ras mutation in a cohort of 20 young and adult mice. After killing, thymus and lungs were analyzed. Thymus was considered active when medullary was evident, cortico-medullary ratio was 50:50 or higher and adipose involution was present. In step 2, a cohort of 20 patients, undergoing surgery for lung cancer, had biopsy of pericardial fat pad, site of ectopic thymus. Thymus was considered present if Hassall’s bodies were detected. In mice, active thymus was detected in a high proportion of cases, without significant difference between adult and young (70% vs 44.4% respectively). Two cases without evidence of lung tumor had a fully functional thymus. In humans, ectopic thymus was detected in the pericardial fat pad in 2 cases (10.5%), confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Signs of previous thymic activity were detected in 8 additional patients. Results confirmed thymus activity in animal models and humans with lung cancer, providing the rationale for future systematic mediastinal thymic biopsy. The comprehension of interactions between thymus, lymphocytes and tumor may open a new potentially targetable perspective in lung cancer.","AbstractBackgroundGlioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary central nervous system tumor characterized by poor outcomes. In case of relapse or progression to adjuvant chemotherapy, there is no univocal preferred regimen for relapsing glioblastoma.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and Bayesian trial-level network meta-analyses (NMA) to identify the regimens associated with the best outcomes. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR). We estimated separate treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values. Only phase II/III prospective comparative trials were included.ResultsTwenty-four studies (3733 patients and 27 different therapies) were ultimately included. Twenty-three different regimens were compared for OS, 21 for PFS, and 26 for ORR. When taking lomustine as a common comparator, only regorafenib was likely to be significantly superior in terms of OS (hazard ratio: 0.50, 95% credible interval: 0.33-0.75). Regorafenib was significantly superior to other 16 (69.6%) regimens, including NovoTTF-100A, bevacizumab monotherapy, and several bevacizumab-based combinations. Regarding PFS and ORR, no treatment was clearly superior to the others.ConclusionsThis NMA supports regorafenib as one of the best available options for relapsing/refractory glioblastoma. Lomustine, NovoTTF-100A, and bevacizumab emerge as other viable alternative regimens. However, evidence on regorafenib is controversial at best. Moreover, most studies were underpowered, with varying inclusion criteria and primary endpoints, and no longer adapted to the most recent glioblastoma classification. A paradigmatic change in clinical trials’ design for relapsing/refractory glioblastoma and more effective treatments are urgently required.",0
"BackgroundPreviously, albendazole (ABZ) has been reported as an anti-parasitic drug rather than anti-tumor drug. Our study aim to investigate whether ABZ also has a potential anti-tumor effect by shaping the tumor immune microenvironment and interrogate whether ABZ could synergize with the PD-L1 blockade.MethodsC57BL/6 mice (C57) were intravenously injected with B16F10-luciferase (B16-luc) cells to establish a lung metastatic melanoma model and subcutaneously inoculated with B16-luc cells to establish a subcutaneous tumor model. The tumor volume and tumor metastasis loci of the mice were measured by a vernier caliper and in vivo imaging. RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the different genes and pathways of immune cells in the tumors. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the different subsets of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.ResultsThe results suggested that ABZ significantly inhibited lung melanoma metastasis with decreased fluorescence intensity and nodule score and mediated the regression of subcutaneous melanoma in mice with decreased tumor volume. Moreover, RNA sequencing results showed that ABZ regulated the gene expression levels and pathways of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Meanwhile, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence showed that the number and percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells were enhanced in tumors after ABZ treatment. Furthermore, the combination of ABZ and anti-PD-L1 treatment significantly potentiated anti-tumor efficacy in both lung metastasis and subcutaneous melanoma models and mediated an increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells as compared to the control group.ConclusionABZ inhibits melanoma growth and metastasis. Moreover, ABZ synergized with PD-L1 blockade mediates tumor regression.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05415-5.","IntroductionNanotechnology has shown potential in treating different types of cancers. In particular, nano-drug delivery systems (DDSs) offer a promising strategy for treating oral cancer. By customizing therapy and improving drug delivery, these systems can improve outcomes for patients. Hence, a review was conducted to assess the current evidence and explore the use of DDSs for treating oral cancer.AimTo comprehensively explore the nano-drug carriers and target delivery for oral cancer therapy and to discuss the benefits, challenges, and potential to guide future research and clinical practice.MethodologyA systematic search of articles archived in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane using keywords such as Nano, drug carrier, target drug delivery, and oral cancer was performed to fulfill the objectives from inception till February 2, 2024. Articles providing insights into nano-drug carriers in oral cancer were included.ResultsThe results revealed a total of 156 articles. After duplicate removal, 136 articles were screened for title and abstract as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 113 articles were excluded with reasons. Out of the remaining 23 articles, only 11 were included for qualitative data synthesis.ConclusionThe literature revealed scarcity of oral cancer-related work using DDSs. Qualitative synthesis of data revealed that nano-drug carriers demonstrated a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic approaches in oral cancer, despite the challenges and their potential benefits. Continued research and development in this field are crucial to overcoming these challenges and fully realizing the potential of nano-drug carriers in revolutionizing oral cancer therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12663-024-02251-z.",1
"Background: Medication dosing in overweight and obese children often involves complex weight-based calculations, leading to higher dosing errors, particularly with intravenous drugs. Currently, tools to aid in dosage calculations are lacking for these patients, especially in Thai population. Objective: This study aimed to develop a mobile application with the intent of utilizing it as a tool to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of dosing calculations required for obese and overweight Thai children. Methods: The performance of the application was assessed in 3 key aspects using a sample of 30 healthcare professionals. These key aspects included: 1) the accuracy of dosage calculations, assessed through pre- and posttests comparing manual calculations to app-based calculations using a 10-item questionnaire, 2) the time taken for calculations before and after app usage, 3) user satisfaction, which was measured through a questionnaire. Results: The integration of applications into the calculation demonstrated a significant improvement when compared to the manual calculation in both accuracy (6.10 vs 9.33 out of 10, P < .001) and efficiency (10.40 vs 8.53 minutes per 10 questions, P = .008). Also, the application elicited high levels of satisfaction among users, as reflected by an overall mean satisfaction score of 4.57 on a 5-point scale. Conclusion: The integration of this application to assist in dosage calculations for overweight and obese pediatric Thai patients has yielded favorable outcomes concerning accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Further development should be pursued within a larger cohort, with an emphasis on real-world implementation in clinical settings.","This study investigated the role of swimming exercise in regulating melanoma tumour growth and glycolysis in cancer cells, the specific mechanism involved was also studied. In our study, a murine melanoma tumour model was established to assess the impact of swimming on tumour growth. The mRNA and protein expressions were assessed using qRT-PCR, western blot, and IHC. The metabolic behavior of melanoma cells was examined through lactic acid level measurements and glucose consumption assessments. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to detect cell viability and proliferation. ELISA was employed to determine the levels of cytokines secreted by macrophages. The interaction between APOL3 and STAT3 was analyzed by dual luciferase reporter gene and ChIP assays. Our results demonstrated that swimming exercise suppressed melanoma growth in mice by suppressing glycolysis, which might be related to APOL3 upregulation. In addition, downregulation of APOL3 in melanoma was associated with poor prognosis, and APOL3 overexpression markedly suppressed melanoma cell proliferation by reducing glucose uptake and lactate production in vitro. Mechanistically, STAT3 directly down-regulated APOL3 transcription. Swimming upregulated APOL3 by inactivating the IL-6R-STAT3 signaling axis in melanoma cells by inhibiting the secretion of IL-6 by M2 macrophages. As expected, IL-6 secreted by M2 macrophages promoted glycolysis in melanoma cells by reducing APOL3 expression. In summary, swimming inactivated the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling axis in melanoma cells by inhibiting the secretion of IL-6 by M2 macrophages, which could suppress the growth of melanoma in the body by upregulating APOL3 to inhibit glycolysis.",0
"Purpose The efficacy and lower neurotoxicity of normal brain-sparing radiotherapy (NBS-RT) with systemic therapy in treating multiple brain metastases from non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is underexplored. This study compares whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and NBS-RT for multiple brain metastases in NSCLC, focusing on treatment outcomes and leukoencephalopathy.Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 503 patients with NSCLC with multiple brain metastases at a single center, treated with either WBRT or NBS-RT. Post-RT treatments included chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Main outcomes measured were intracranial control, overall survival (OS), and leukoencephalopathy incidence.Results In this study, 441 patients received WBRT and 62 received NBS-RT, with median ages of 62 and 61 years, respectively. A significant portion of both groups, 77.3% in WBRT and 80.6% in NBS-RT, received post-RT systemic therapy. The median number of brain metastases was 10 for WBRT and 12 for NBS-RT, with median maximal diameters of 11.7 mm in WBRT and 14.4 mm in NBS-RT. After a median follow-up of 10.9 months for WBRT and 11.8 months for NBS-RT, there were no significant differences in intracranial progression (p=0.516) or OS (p=0.492) between the groups. However, WBRT patients had a higher incidence of leukoencephalopathy than NBS-RT patients (p=0.013).Conclusion NBS-RT combined with systemic therapy was as effective in treating multiple brain metastases as WBRT and was less toxic. NBS-RT-based strategies deserve further investigation in a prospective setting.","ObjectivePrimary intracranial histiocytic sarcomas (PIHSs) are extremely rare with limited reported cases, making their prognostic factors and management uncertain. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of PIHSs and propose a treatment protocol for this entity.MethodsClinical data were collected from six patients diagnosed with PIHSs at Beijing Tiantan Hospital between March 2011 and October 2022. Additionally, a comprehensive search of the PubMed database was conducted using the keywords ""primary intracranial"" or ""primary central nervous system"" combined with ""histiocytic sarcoma"" or ""histiocytic sarcomas"" between 1996 and 2022, identifying 24 cases. A pooled analysis of individual patient data was performed to assess risk factors for overall survival (OS).ResultsThe six cases included four males and two females, with a mean age of 42.2 ± 13.3 years. In total, 24 cases of PIHSs were identified from previous studies. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that gross total resection (GTR) was the only factor predicting a longer OS (p = 0.027). Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that GTR (p = 0.0013), solitary lesions (p = 0.0048), and radiotherapy (p = 0.0492) were associated with a longer OS.ConclusionPIHSs are rare brain tumors with poor clinical prognosis. Patients with solitary lesions have a longer OS than those with multifocal lesions. Gross total resection must be the first choice. Radiotherapy may bring benefits for these patients, but chemotherapy may not be useful. Further studies involving larger cohorts are necessary to validate these findings.",1
"Background and Aims:HSCs contribute to HCC progression by regulating multiple factors. However, the entire immunoregulatory functions of HSCs are still obscure. Here, we aim to investigate whether HSCs impose CX3CR1+ macrophages to protumorigenic properties in the peritumoral area.Approach and Results:In single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of patients with HCC, a subpopulation of macrophages specifically expressed Arg1 and Cx3cr1 in the peritumoral area and were highly enriched with retinol metabolism–related genes. Flow cytometry analysis showed significantly increased frequencies of CD14+CD11b+HLA-DR− macrophages with CX3CR1 in the HCC adjacent region where α-smooth muscle actin–expressing activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) showed colocalized expression of CX3CL1. Accordingly, in tumor-bearing mice, Cx3cl1 mRNA expression was notably increased in aHSCs within the adjacent HCC, where infiltration of CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages was mostly observed with decreased CD8+ T cells. In adoptive transfer and in vitro coculture of myeloid cells, we demonstrated that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrated and highly expressed arginase-1 by interacting with retinoid-enriched aHSCs in the adjacent HCC. Direct treatment of retinoids or coculturing with retinol-storing mouse aHSCs or human LX-2 cells significantly increased arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages and human blood CD14+ cells, leading to the suppression of CD8+ T-cell proliferation. Moreover, genetic deficiency of CX3CR1 in myeloid cells or pharmacological inhibition of retinol metabolism remarkably attenuated HCC development.Conclusions:We showed that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrate and interact with aHSCs in the peritumoral region where retinoids induce arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages, subsequently depriving CD8+ T cells of arginine and promoting HCC.","AbstractThis review discusses terminology recently proposed for the classification of dementia and, more specifically, nosology related to aging-associated TDP-43 pathology: limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), and limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS). While the “gold standard” for these clinical conditions is still LATE neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC), clinical criteria and biomarkers are evolving. The newly proposed clinical rubrics are discussed with emphasis on the need for terminology that acknowledges the distinctions between clinical syndrome-, molecular biomarker-, and pathologically defined disease concepts. As further progress is made on research into the specific biomarker-based detection and prediction of TDP-43 proteinopathy in the clinical setting, the definitions of “Probable” and “Possible” LATE are likely to become more useful clinically. For people interested in the pathological diagnoses or basic research related to LATE-NC, the relevant terminology remains unchanged by the newly proposed clinical criteria.",0
"PurposeExisting biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.MethodsAn animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.ResultsWe identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes (RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and metastasis.ConclusionThe model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04495-z.","BackgroundCancer metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, underscoring the importance of understanding its underlying mechanisms. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly malignant type of cancer, was selected as our research model.Material and methodsWe aimed to develop high-metastatic cell lines using in vitro and in vivo selection strategies and identify critical metastasis-related genes through microarray analyses by comparing them with parental cells.ResultsOur results showed that the high-metastatic cell lines exhibited significantly stronger invasion abilities than parental cells. Microarray analyses identified cytidine deaminase (CDA), a gene associated with systemic chemotherapy resistance, as one of the overexpressed genes in the high-metastatic cells. Data analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program revealed that while CDA is downregulated in HCC, patients with high CDA expression tend to have poorer prognoses. Cell models confirmed that CDA overexpression enhances cell migration and invasion, whereas CDA knockdown inhibits these abilities. Investigating the key molecules involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we found that CDA overexpression increases the expression of fascin, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and snail while decreasing E-cadherin expression. Conversely, CDA knockdown produced opposite results. Additionally, we discovered that CDA regulates NF-κB signaling, which controls the expression of N-cadherin, thereby promoting the invasion capability of HCC cells.ConclusionsWe isolated highly metastatic cells and identified potential HCC metastasis-related genes. CDA promotes cell invasion by regulating EMT through the NF-κB pathway. Future studies are warranted to explore the potential of CDA as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic decision-making.",1
"AbstractBackgroundThe pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE—an animal model of MS) is primarily mediated by T cells. However, recent studies have only focused on interleukin (IL)‐17‐secreting CD4+ T‐helper cells, also known as Th17 cells. This study aimed to compare Th17 cells and IL‐17‐secreting CD8+ T‐cytotoxic cells (Tc17) in the context of MS/EAE.MethodsFemale C57BL/6 mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptides 35–55 (MOG35–55), pertussis toxin, and complete Freund's adjuvant to establish the EAE animal model. T cells were isolated from the spleen (12–14 days postimmunization). CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were purified using isolation kit and then differentiated into Th17 and Tc17, respectively, using MOG35–55 and IL‐23. The secretion levels of interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) and IL‐17 were measured via enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay using cultured CD4+ and CD8+ T cell supernatants. The pathogenicity of Tc17 and Th17 cells was assessed through adoptive transfer (tEAE), with the clinical course assessed using an EAE score (0–5). Hematoxylin and eosin as well as Luxol fast blue staining were used to examine the spinal cord. Purified CD8+ CD3+ and CD4+ CD3+ cells differentiated into Tc17 and Th17 cells, respectively, were stimulated with MOG35–55 peptide for proliferation assays.ResultsThe results showed that Tc17 cells (15,951 ± 1985 vs. 55,709 ± 4196 cpm; p < 0.050) exhibited a weaker response to highest dose (20 μg/mL) MOG35–55 than Th17 cells. However, this response was not dependent on Th17 cells. After the 48 h stimulation, at the highest dose (20 μg/mL) of MOG35–55. Tc17 cells secreted lower levels of IFN‐γ (280.00 ± 15.00 vs. 556.67 ± 15.28 pg/mL, p < 0.050) and IL‐17 (102.67 ± 5.86 pg/mL vs. 288.33 ± 12.58 pg/mL; p < 0.050) than Th17 cells. Similar patterns were observed for IFN‐γ secretion at 96 and 144 h. Furthermore, Tc17 cell‐induced tEAE mice exhibited similar EAE scores to Th17 cell‐induced tEAE mice and also showed similar inflammation and demyelination.ConclusionThe degree of pathogenicity of Tc17 cells in EAE is lower than that of Th17 cells. Future investigation on different immune cells and EAE models is warranted to determine the mechanisms underlying MS.","Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a key cytokine regulating the development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death of T cells. In CD4+ T cells, TGF-β maintains the quiescence and controls the activation of naive T cells. While inhibiting the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, TGF-β promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells. TGF-β is required for the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells and the development of regulatory T cells. TGF-β is crucial in the differentiation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells and their retention in the tissue, whereas it suppresses effector T cell function. In addition, TGF-β also regulates the generation or function of natural killer T cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes. Here I highlight the major findings and recent advances in our understanding of TGF-β regulation of T cells and provide a personal perspective of the field.",1
"ABSTRACTSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) has been proved to be able to effectively down-regulate gene expression through the RNAi mechanism. Thus, siRNA-based drugs have become one of the hottest research directions due to their high efficiency and specificity. However, challenges such as instability, off-target effects and immune activation hinder their clinical application. This review explores the mechanisms of siRNA and the challenges in siRNA-based tumor therapy. It highlights the use of various nanomaterials – including lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and inorganic nanoparticles – as carriers for siRNA delivery in different therapeutic modalities. The application strategies of siRNA-based nanomedicine in chemotherapy, phototherapy and immunotherapy are discussed in detail, along with recent clinical advancements. Aiming to provide insights for future research and therapeutic approaches.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy shows unprecedented efficacy for cancer treatment, particularly in treating patients with various blood cancers, most notably B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In recent years, CAR T-cell therapies have been investigated for treating other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Despite the remarkable success of CAR T-cell therapy, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an unexpected side effect that is potentially life-threatening. Our aim is to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine release associated with CRS by controlling CAR surface density on CAR T cells. We show that CAR expression density can be titrated on the surface of primary T cells using an acoustic-electric microfluidic platform. The platform performs dosage-controlled delivery by uniformly mixing and shearing cells, delivering approximately the same amount of CAR gene coding mRNA into each T cell.",0
"ABSTRACTPatients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have very poor long-term outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can potentially cure some of these patients who are able to achieve a second or greater remission with salvage chemotherapy. Unfortunately, several barriers exist to transplantation and not all patients with r/r AML are able to proceed to allo-SCT. Therefore, novel therapies to decrease the risk of relapse in these patients are urgently needed. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein has emerged as an encouraging vaccine target in AML due to its overexpression in leukemic blast cells and near absence in normal hematopoietic cells. Maintenance therapy with galinpepimut-S, a multivalent heteroclitic WT1 peptide vaccine, holds promise in early phase trials, in patients with AML by inducing a strong innate immune response against the WT1 antigen, leading to the design of this international, open-label, randomized clinical trial, named REGAL. Clinical trial registration:  The clinical trial identifier is NCT04229979.","Purpose of ReviewAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal blood neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in mitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by novel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluation.Recent FindingsMetabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity to therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial metabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a breakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial complexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting these vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy in preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results limited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on drug combinations with synergistic or additive activity.SummaryIn this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies targeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the specific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to achieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that currently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or are not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells. Thus, further studies of complex metabolic rewiring of leukemia cells before and after combinatorial therapies are warranted.",1
"PurposeThe applications of liposomes are limited due to poor structural stability and short drug circulation time. This study aims to build an albumin-based liposomal delivery system to provide strategies for tumor specificity, efficient gene delivery and effective release of albumin liposomes.MethodsIn this study, siRNA loaded PDL1-targeted albumin liposome was constructed for the treatment of lung cancer and its function was evaluated. Physical parameters such as particle size, potential and infrared spectrum were detected and microscopic morphology was observed by electron microscopy to detect the binding and uptake capacity of albumin liposome with cells. The optimal preparation process and binding ratio of PDL1-targeted albumin liposome/siRNA complex were determined.ResultsThe constructed siRNA loaded PDL1-targeted albumin liposomes has low toxicity, high loading rate and tumor cell targeted gene therapy ability. Moreover, it increased T cell activation and down-regulated siRNA expression, effectively realizing the inhibition of lung cancer cells.ConclusionThe results showed that the PDL1-targeted albumin liposome could be used as a high efficient delivery vector of siRNA, and was a high efficient and safe nano vector for tumor targeted gene therapy.","BackgroundSeveral translational animal models have been described assessing intra-arterial (IA) treatments for malignant gliomas. We describe the first endovascular animal model that allows testing of IA drug delivery as a first-line treatment, which is difficult to do in actual patients. We report a unique protocol for vascular access and IA delivery in the rat model that, unlike prior reports, does not require direct puncture and opening of proximal cerebrovasculature which carries risk of ischemia in the animal brain post-delivery.MethodsWistar rats underwent left femoral artery catherization with a Balt Magic 1.2F catheter or Marathon Flow directed 1.5F Microcatheter with an Asahi Chikai 0.008 micro-guidewire which was navigated to the left internal carotid artery under x-ray. 25% mannitol was administered to test blood brain barrier breakdown (BBBB). Additional rats were implanted with C6 glioma cells in the left frontal lobe. C6 Glioma-Implanted Rats (C6GRs) were monitored for overall survival and tumor growth. Tumor volumes from MRI images were calculated utilizing 3D slicer. Additional rats underwent femoral artery catheterization with Bevacizumab, carboplatin, or irinotecan injected into the left internal carotid artery to test feasibility and safety.ResultsA successful endovascular access and BBBB protocol was established. BBBB was confirmed with positive Evans blue staining. 10 rats were successfully implanted with C6 gliomas with confirmed growths on MRI. Overall survival was 19.75 ± 2.21 days. 5 rats were utilized for the development of our femoral catheterization protocol and BBBB testing. With regards to IA chemotherapy dosage testing, control rats tolerated targeted 10 mg/kg of bevascizumab, 2.4 mg/kg of carboplatin, and 15 mg/kg of irinotecan IA ICA injections without any complications.ConclusionsWe present the first endovascular IA rat glioma model that allows selective catheterization of the intracranial vasculature and assessment of IA therapies for gliomas without need for access and sacrifice of proximal cerebrovasculature.",0
"Pattern recognition receptors are an essential part of the immune system, which detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and help shape both innate and adaptive immune responses. When dsDNA is present, cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) produces a second messenger called cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which then triggers an adaptor protein called STING, and eventually activates the expression of type I interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in immune cells. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway has been receiving a lot of attention lately as a key immune-surveillance mediator. In this review, we summarize the present circumstances of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in viral infections and inflammatory diseases, as well as autoimmune diseases. Modulation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway provides potential strategies for treating viral infections, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases.","Background and aimsThrough visual analysis of related literature, the main research direction and hot spots of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in recent 24 years were explored.MethodsThis study used bibliometric analysis with CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Biblioshiny and online analytic tool bibliometric.com to provide a quantitative analysis, hot spot mining, and commentary of articles published in the field of LSECs research. The relevant literature in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) was searched from 2000 to 2023. The publications with topics or titles or keywords containing LSECs were included into this study. The countries, organizations, journals, authors, and keywords of the publications were summarized and analyzed.ResultsThis study included 3,747 publications from 14,132 authors belonging to 389 institutions in 61 countries/regions and published in 150 journals, with 156,309 citations. The United States contributed most  to the publications. The most productive institution was the University of Sydney. Hepatology accounts for the most output (293, 7.8​%), European authors had a widespread cooperation. The most productive author was Adam DH with 68 papers. Immunological function of LSECs is research hot spot.ConclusionThis study highlights key trends based on a large dataset of the most influential publications about LSECs research over a 24-year period. It provides important clues and ideas for researchers focusing in this area and facilitates future liver disease mechanism, understanding, and treatment.",0
"AbstractBackgroundBlack, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) communities bear a disproportional burden of seasonal influenza hospitalizations in the United States.MethodsWe developed a race-stratified (5 racial-ethnic groups) agent-based model of seasonal influenza transmission and quantify the effects of 5 idealized interventions aimed at reducing inequities in symptomatic infections and hospitalizations. The interventions assumed  equalized vaccination rates,  equalized comorbidities,  work-risk distribution proportional to the distribution of the population,  reduced work contacts for all, or  a combination of equalizing vaccination rates and comorbidities and reducing work contacts.ResultsOur analysis suggests that symptomatic infections could be greatly reduced (by up to 17% in BIPOC adults aged 18–49 years) by strategies reducing work contacts or equalizing vaccination rates. All tested interventions reduced the inequity in influenza hospitalizations in all racial-ethnic groups, but interventions equalizing comorbidities were the most effective, with more than 40% less hospitalizations in BIPOC groups. Inequities in hospitalizations in different racial-ethnic groups responded differently to interventions, pointing to the need of tailored interventions for different populations. Notably, these interventions resulted in better outcomes across all racial-ethnic groups, not only those prioritized by the interventions.ConclusionsIn this simulation modeling study, equalizing vaccination rates and reducing number of work contacts (eg, improving air filtration systems, tailored vaccination campaigns) reduced both inequity and the total number of symptomatic infections and hospitalizations in all age and racial-ethnic groups. Reducing inequity in influenza hospitalizations requires different interventions for different groups.","Host-based gene expression analysis is a promising tool for a broad range of clinical applications, including rapid infectious disease diagnostics and real-time disease monitoring. However, the complex instrumentation requirements and slow turnaround-times associated with traditional gene expression analysis methods have hampered their widespread adoption at the point-of-care (POC). To overcome these challenges, we have developed an automated and portable platform that utilizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and giant magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensors to perform rapid multiplexed, targeted gene expression analysis at the POC. As proof-of-concept, we utilized our platform to amplify and measure the expression of four genes (HERC5, HERC6, IFI27, and IFIH1) that were previously shown to be upregulated in hosts infected with influenza viruses. The compact instrument conducted highly automated PCR amplification and GMR detection to measure the expression of the four genes in multiplex, then utilized Bluetooth communication to relay results to users on a smartphone application. To validate the platform, we tested 20 cDNA samples from symptomatic patients that had been previously diagnosed as either influenza-positive or influenza-negative using a RT-PCR virology panel. A non-parametric Mann–Whitney test revealed that day 0 (day of symptom onset) gene expression was significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.0001, n = 20). Hence, we preliminarily demonstrated that our platform could accurately discriminate between symptomatic influenza and non-influenza populations based on host gene expression in ∼30 min. This study not only establishes the potential clinical utility of our proposed assay and device for influenza diagnostics but it also paves the way for broadscale and decentralized implementation of host-based gene expression diagnostics at the POC.",1
"The immune system is highly regulated but, when dysregulated, suboptimal protective or overly robust immune responses can lead to immune-mediated disorders. The genetic and molecular mechanisms of immune regulation are incompletely understood, impeding the development of more precise diagnostics and therapeutics for immune-mediated disorders. Recently, thousands of previously unrecognized noncanonical microprotein genes encoded by small open reading frames have been identified. Many of these microproteins perform critical functions, often in a cell- and context-specific manner. Several microproteins are now known to regulate immunity; however, the vast majority are uncharacterized. Therefore, illuminating what is often referred to as the “dark proteome,” may present opportunities to tune immune responses more precisely. Here, we review noncanonical microprotein biology, highlight recently discovered examples regulating immunity, and discuss the potential and challenges of modulating dysregulated immune responses by targeting microproteins.","AbstractIntroductionAmong older adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy, frailty indices predict OS and toxicity. Given the increased use of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC), we evaluated frailty and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) among older adults with aNSCLC receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted therapy.MethodsPatients aged ≥ 65 with aNSCLC starting systemic therapy with non-curative intent underwent geriatric assessments over 6 months. We developed a deficit-accumulation frailty index to categorize patients as robust, pre-frail, or frail. To evaluate associations between frailty and KPS with OS, we used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for race, insurance, and treatment. We used logistic regression to evaluate hospitalizations, functional decline, and severe toxicity.ResultsAmong 155 patients (median age 73), 45.8% were robust, 36.1% pre-frail, and 18.2% frail; 34.8% had a KPS ≥ 90, 32.9% had a KPS of 80, and 32.3% had a KPS ≤ 70. The median OS was 17.9 months. Pre-frail/frail patients had worse OS compared to robust patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.09, 95% CI, 1.31-3.34) and were more likely to be hospitalized (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.21, 95% CI, 1.09-4.48), functionally decline (adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI, 1.09-4.78), and experience grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicity (adjusted OR 5.18, 95% CI, 1.02-26.03). KPS was only associated with OS.Conclusions Our frailty index was associated with OS, hospitalization, functional decline, and hematologic AEs among older adults with aNSCLC receiving systemic therapies, while KPS was only associated with OS. Pretreatment frailty assessment may help identify older adults at risk for poor outcomes to optimize decision-making and supportive care.",0
"Aim: Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx (COCO) often exhibit signs of immunosuppression, affecting their prognosis. Understanding the dynamics of humoral immunity in these patients during chemoradiation therapy is crucial for developing effective treatments.Materials & methods: This prospective study included 105 COCO patients undergoing different treatment regimens, with or without alpha/beta-defensins therapy. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, IgA and salivary sIgA were analyzed. Patients were divided into five groups based on treatment protocols.Results & conclusion: Treatment variations impacted serum immunoglobulin levels, notably in Group III, whose patients received radiation treatment and immunotherapy with higher alpha/beta-defensins doses. Significant IgG changes correlated with oral mucositis risk and outcomes. Further trials are necessary for validation and clinical application.","Purpose:Transcriptional profiling of pancreatic cancers (PC) has defined two main transcriptional subtypes, classical and basal. Initial data suggest shorter survival for patients with basal tumors and differing treatment sensitivity to FOLFIRINOX (FFX) and gemcitabine nab-Paclitaxel (GnP) by transcriptional subtype.Experimental Design:We examined 8,743 patients with RNA sequencing from PCs performed at Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ). Classical and basal subtypes were identified using PurIST algorithm on RNA-sequencing and two cohorts were analyzed:  Biomarker cohort included patients with complete molecular profiling data (n = 7,250);  Outcomes cohort included patients with metastatic disease with available survival outcomes (n=5,335). 3,842 patients were shared between the two cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess patient survival.Results:In the biomarker cohort, 3,063 tumors (42.2%) were strongly classical (SC), and 2,015 tumors (27.8%) were strongly basal (SB). SC and SB tumors showed strong associations with histologic phenotypes and biopsy site. SB tumors had higher rates of KRAS, TP53, and ARID1A mutations, lower rates of SMAD4 mutation, and transcriptional evidence of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Sixty of 77 cases (78%) maintained their transcriptional subtype between temporally and/or spatially disparate lesions. In the outcomes cohort, SB subtype was associated with shorter overall survival time, regardless of whether they received FFX or GnP as first line chemotherapy. Mutant KRAS allele type was prognostic of outcomes, however this impact was restricted to SC tumors, whereas all mutant KRAS alleles had similarly poor outcomes in SB tumors.Conclusions:SB subtype is a strong independent predictor of worse outcomes, irrespective of upfront chemotherapy regimen. Clinical trials should further investigate PC transcriptional subtypes as a prognostic and predictive biomarker.",0
"ABSTRACTMalignant tumors including gastric cancer (GC) are the leading cause of deaths among reproductive women. Physiological morning sickness can mask the clinical manifestations of GC, whereas the clinical presence of metastatic tumors in the abdominal cavity may be easily mistaken for abdominal swelling caused by fetal growth. Pregnancy and delivery processes in young females could accelerate the growth of GC, leading to its rapid development and grave prognosis. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical and gastrointestinal endoscopy is recommended for any suspected pregnant woman with long-term morning sickness. Treatment strategies, including chemotherapy, resection surgery and radiotherapy, will be determined based on a comprehensive consideration of the status of both the fetus and the mother. Rational management, especially clinical multidisciplinary collaboration may significantly benefit such patients.","We describe a patient with extra-limbic seronegative encephalitis with relapsing progressive course as the harbinger of sequential Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Diffuse Large B-Cell lymphoma. Diagnosis of probable paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome (PNS) was arrived at by exhaustive elimination of alternative causes and supportive tissue diagnosis. This case highlights the phenotypic variety of paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes associated with hematologic malignancies and the challenges in their recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. We discuss and apply the updated consensus diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic syndromes to our case as a means of bolstering probability in cases of diagnostic uncertainty.",0
"IntroductionTumor immunotherapy has recently emerged as a crucial focal point in oncology treatment research. Among tumor immunotherapy approaches, tumor immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have attracted substantial attention in clinical research. However, this treatment modality has benefitted only a limited number of patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of various biomarkers to decipher their prognostic implications in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who are treated with ICIs, and thus identify predictive markers with practical clinical relevance.MethodsA systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify clinical studies that examined the correlation between biomarkers and treatment outcomes in the HNSCC patients. The included articles were screened and analyzed to extract data regarding overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).ResultsThe relationship between the biomarkers included in the summary and prognosis was as follows: HPV positivity was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58–1.99), PFS (HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.81–1.67), and response (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.37–2.99). PD-L1 positivity was associated with OS (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.59–0.85), PFS (HR = 0.56 95% CI = 0.43–0.73), and response (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.51–3.10). Neither HPV positivity nor PD-L1 positivity was associated with DCR. The following markers were collected for OS and PFS data and were associated with longer OS: lower Glasgow prognostic score (GPS/mGPS) grading, lower PS grading, high body mass index (BMI), low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), low platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), high albumin (Alb), low lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Factors associated with better PFS were lower GPS/mGPS grading, lower PS grading, high BMI, low NLR, high absolute lymphocyte count, and low LDH. Hyperprogressive disease was associated with worse OS and PFS. Fewer clinical studies have been completed on the tumor microenvironment and hypoxia, microsatellite instability/DNA mismatch repair, and microbiome and systematic analysis is difficult.ConclusionIn our meta-analysis, different immune checkpoint factors were associated with different prognoses in HNSCC patients receiving immunotherapy. HPV, PD-L1, BMI, Alb, HPD, PS, GPS/mGPS, LDH, NLR, and PLR predicted the ICI outcome in HNSCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05504-5.","BackgroundThe efficacy of adding atezolizumab to the platinum doublet regimen for extensive disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) remains marginally limited.MethodsWe retrospectively assessed the real-world efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in addition to carboplatin and etoposide (EP + A), versus carboplatin and etoposide (EP) alone in previously untreated ED-SCLC patients.ResultsFrom a total of 99 patients, 46 were assigned to the EP + A group, and 53 to the EP group. No significant difference was observed in progression-free survival between the groups. However, the overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in the EP + A group (20.8 vs 12.1 months; HR: 0.52; p = 0.0127). Patients older than 70 years, male, with performance status 0–1, without liver metastasis, and low levels of C-reactive protein and neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, experienced longer OS in the EP + A group compared to the EP group.ConclusionThe addition of atezolizumab to the platinum doublet regimen significantly extended OS in ED-SCLC patients, particularly among certain subgroups, suggesting its potential value in personalized treatment strategies. Further investigation is warranted to validate these findings.",1
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated myocarditis is a rare but severe complication for patients treated with immunotherapy. This study aims to explore the predictive significance of patients’ clinical features and examination results for the severity of ICI-associated myocarditis.MethodsData from a real-world cohort of 81 cancer patients who developed ICI-associated myocarditis after immunotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. The development of myocarditis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3–5 and/or the major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was set as endpoints. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive value of each factor.ResultsCTCAE grades 3–5 and MACE developed in 43/81 (53.1%) and 28/81 (34.6%) cases, respectively. The likelihood of CTCAE grades 3–5 and MACE increased with the accumulation of organs affected by the ICI-associated adverse events and initial clinical symptoms. Concurrent systematic therapies during ICI treatment did not raise the risk of myocarditis severity, while prior chemotherapy did. Besides classical serum cardiac markers, a higher neutrophil ratio was also related to poorer cardiac outcomes, whereas higher lymphocyte and monocyte ratios were predictors of favorable cardiac outcomes. The CD4+ T cell ratio and CD4/CD8 ratio were negatively related to CTCAE grades 3–5. Several cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters were associated with myocarditis severity, whereas the predictive value of echocardiography and electrocardiogram was weak.ConclusionThis study comprehensively evaluated the prognostic value of patients’ clinical characteristics and examination results and identified several predictors of severe ICI-associated myocarditis, which will facilitate early detection of severe ICI-associated myocarditis in patients receiving immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04782-3.","In recent years, the therapeutic landscape for hematological malignancies has markedly advanced, particularly since the inaugural approval of autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy in 2017 for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Autologous CAR-T therapy involves the genetic modification of a patient’s T cells to specifically identify and attack cancer cells, while bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) function by binding to both cancer cells and immune cells simultaneously, thereby triggering an immune response against the tumor.

"PurposeDue to the rarity of primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL), the prognostic factors and optimal management of PGIL have not been clearly defined. We aimed to establish prognostic models using a deep learning algorithm for survival prediction.MethodsWe collected 11,168 PGIL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to form the training and test cohorts. At the same time, we collected 82 PGIL patients from three medical centres to form the external validation cohort. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model, random survival forest (RSF) model, and neural multitask logistic regression (DeepSurv) model to predict PGIL patients’ overall survival (OS).ResultsThe 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of PGIL patients in the SEER database were 77.1%, 69.4%, 63.7%, and 50.3%, respectively. The RSF model based on all variables showed that the top three most important variables for predicting OS were age, histological type, and chemotherapy. The independent risk factors for PGIL patient prognosis included sex, age, race, primary site, Ann Arbor stage, histological type, symptom, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, according to the Lasso regression analysis. Using these factors, we built the CoxPH and DeepSurv models. The DeepSurv model’s C-index values were 0.760 in the training cohort, 0.742 in the test cohort, and 0.707 in the external validation cohort, which demonstrated that the DeepSurv model performed better compared to the RSF model (0.728) and the CoxPH model (0.724). The DeepSurv model accurately predicted 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year OS. Both calibration curves and decision curve analysis curves demonstrated the superior performance of the DeepSurv model. We developed the DeepSurv model as an online web calculator for survival prediction, which can be accessed at  DeepSurv model with external validation is superior to previous studies in predicting short-term and long-term survival and can help us make better-individualized decisions for PGIL patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05123-0.","Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat in the medical field. Machine learning (ML) has enabled in-depth analysis of complex patterns from large, diverse datasets, greatly facilitating “healthcare automation” in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Despite these advancements, ML models face challenges stemming from limited labeled sample sizes, the intricate interplay of high-dimensionality data types, the inherent heterogeneity observed among patients and within tumors, and concerns about interpretability and consistency with existing biomedical knowledge. One approach to address these challenges is to integrate biomedical knowledge into data-driven models, which has proven potential to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of model results. Here, we review the state-of-the-art ML studies that leverage the fusion of biomedical knowledge and data, termed knowledge-informed machine learning (KIML), to advance cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We provide an overview of diverse forms of knowledge representation and current strategies of knowledge integration into machine learning pipelines with concrete examples. We conclude the review article by discussing future directions aimed at leveraging KIML to advance cancer research and healthcare automation.

"The SWI/SNF complex, also known as the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) complex, represents a critical regulator of chromatin remodeling mechanisms in mammals. It is alternatively referred to as mSWI/SNF and has been suggested to be imbalanced in human disease compared with human health. Three types of BAF assemblies associated with it have been described, including  canonical BAF (cBAF),  polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), and  non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complexes. Each of these BAF assemblies plays a role, either functional or dysfunctional, in governing gene expression patterns, cellular processes, epigenetic mechanisms, and biological processes. Recent evidence increasingly links the dysregulation of mSWI/SNF complexes to various human non-malignant lung chronic disorders and lung malignant diseases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive general state-of-the-art and a profound examination of the current understanding of mSWI/SNF assembly processes, as well as the structural and functional organization of mSWI/SNF complexes and their subunits. In addition, it explores their intricate functional connections with potentially dysregulated transcription factors, placing particular emphasis on molecular and cellular pathogenic processes in lung diseases. These processes are reflected in human epigenome aberrations that impact clinical and therapeutic levels, suggesting novel perspectives on the diagnosis and molecular therapies for human respiratory diseases.","The number of therapies for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction has nearly doubled in the past decade. In addition, new therapies for HF caused by hypertrophic and infiltrative disease are emerging rapidly. Indeed, we are on the verge of a new era in HF in which insights into the biology of myocardial disease can be matched to an understanding of the genetic predisposition in an individual patient to inform precision approaches to therapy. In this Review, we summarize the biology of HF, emphasizing the causal relationships between genetic contributors and traditional structure-based remodelling outcomes, and highlight the mechanisms of action of traditional and novel therapeutics. We discuss the latest advances in our understanding of both the Mendelian genetics of cardiomyopathy and the complex genetics of the clinical syndrome presenting as HF. In the phenotypic domain, we discuss applications of machine learning for the subcategorization of HF in ways that might inform rational prescribing of medications. We aim to bridge the gap between the biology of the failing heart, its diverse clinical presentations and the range of medications that we can now use to treat it. We present a roadmap for the future of precision medicine in HF.",0
"ABSTRACTHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer-related death with limited therapies, is a complex disease developing in a background of Hepatitis Virus infection or systemic conditions, such as the metabolic syndrome. Investigating HCC pathogenesis in model organisms is therefore crucial for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been instrumental in recapitulating the local and systemic features of HCC. Early studies using GEMMs and patient material implicated members of the dimeric Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, such as c-Jun and c-Fos, in HCC formation. In a recent report, we described how switchable, hepatocyte-restricted expression of a single-chain c-Jun~Fra-2 protein, functionally mimicking the c-Jun/Fra-2 AP-1 dimer, results in spontaneous and largely reversible liver tumors in GEMMs. Dysregulated cell cycle, inflammation, and dyslipidemia are observed at early stages and tumors display molecular HCC signatures. We demonstrate that increased c-Myc expression is an essential molecular determinant of tumor formation that can be therapeutically targeted using the BET inhibitor JQ1. Here, we discuss these findings with additional results illustrating how AP-1 GEMMs can foster preclinical research on liver diseases with novel perspectives offered by the constantly increasing wealth of HCC-related datasets.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal human malignancy with a very low overall and long-term survival rate. Poor prognostic outcomes are predominantly associated with HCC due to a huge landscape of heterogeneity found in the deadliest disease. However, molecular subtyping of HCC has significantly improved the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that contribute towards the heterogeneity and progression of the disease. In this review, we have extensively summarized the current information available about molecular classification of HCC. This review can be of great significance for providing the insight information needed for development of novel, efficient and personalized therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC patients globally.",1
"PurposeThe determination of the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression is part of the diagnostic algorithm for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We aimed to analyze the diagnostic performance of EBUS-TBNA performed as first-choice nodal staging procedure for the determination of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC patients.MethodsLongitudinal-prospective study including NSCLC patients diagnosed between January 2018 and October 2019, for whom a primary tumor biopsy sample and an EBUS-TBNA cytological malignant sample were available. Samples with fewer than 100 malignant cells were considered inadequate. PDL-1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx antibody was used. The percentage of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, setting 1% and 50% as cutoff points, was collected. The weighted kappa coefficient was used to assess the concordance of PD-L1 expression. The PD-L1 expression was compared in precision terms.ResultsFrom a total of 43 patients, 53 pairs of samples were obtained, of which 23 (43.4%) were adequate and included for analysis. The weighted kappa coefficient for PD-L1 expression was 0.41 (95% CI 0.15–0.68) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.23–0.9) for cutoff values ≥ 1% and ≥ 50%, respectively. In advanced stages, the weighted kappa coefficient was 0.6 (95% CI 0.3–0.9) and 1 (95% CI 1–1) for PD-L1 expression cutoff values ≥ 1% and ≥ 50%, respectively. EBUS-TBNA showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 1 to detect PDL-1 expression ≥ 50% in advanced stages.ConclusionEBUS-TBNA performed as first nodal staging procedure in advanced NSCLC patients provides reliable specimens for the detection of PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% and could guide immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05039-9.","Lung cancer continues to be the third leading cause of cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths. As the field of interventional oncology continues to grow, interventional radiologists are increasingly treating lung cancer patients. Involvement begins with tissue diagnosis for which biomarkers and immunohistochemistry are used to guide selective and advanced medical therapies. An interventional radiologist must be aware of the rationale behind tissue diagnosis and techniques to minimize biopsy complications. Staging is an important part of tumor board conversations and drives treatment pathways. Surgical therapy remains the gold standard for early-stage disease but with an aging population the need for less invasive treatments such as radiation therapy and ablation continue to grow. The interventionalist must be aware of the indications, techniques, and pre- and posttherapy managements for percutaneous ablation. Endovascular therapy is broadly divided into therapeutic treatment of lung cancer, which is gaining traction, and treatment of lung cancer complications such as hemoptysis. This review aims to provide a good basis for interventional radiologists treating lung cancer patients.",0
"Background:Activation of TLR3 receptors, which are sensitive to viral infection, has emerged as a possible mechanism that increases alcohol intake in rodents.Objectives:These studies examined whether a history of ethanol dependence exacerbated the increase in drinking driven by the TLR3 agonist poly I:C.Methods:Male C57BL/6J mice (>10 per group) were given access to ethanol (20% v/v) 2 hours a day following a history of home cage drinking or after having been rendered ethanol-dependent using a chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor model. After testing multiple doses, a 5 mg/kg repeated poly I:C challenge was used to probe the effects of repeated immune challenge, alone or in conjunction with repeated cycles of CIE, on voluntary drinking. An ethanol (12% v/v) operant self-administration model was used to test the effects of poly I:C on stress-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking and consumption.Results:Poly I:C in naive animals resulted in transient, modest increases in ethanol intake in the home cage and in self-administration (p < 0.05). However, poly I:C challenge resulted in sensitized stress-induced ethanol consumption and evoked a strong and persistent escalation of drinking in mice with a history of dependence (p < 0.05 for both).Conclusion:Activation of viral immune defense may affect ethanol consumption in dependence and sensitivity to future stressors. As patients who suffer from alcohol use disorder are at a heightened risk for viral infection, this interaction could generate risk factors for exacerbating behaviors associated with Alcohol Use Disorders via an immune mechanism.","AbstractTraditional vaccines have played an important role in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, but they still have problems such as low immunogenicity, poor stability, and difficulty in inducing lasting immune responses. In recent years, the nucleic acid vaccine has emerged as a relatively cheap and safe new vaccine. Compared with traditional vaccines, nucleic acid vaccine has some unique advantages, such as easy production and storage, scalability, and consistency between batches. However, the direct administration of naked nucleic acid vaccine is not ideal, and safer and more effective vaccine delivery systems are needed. With the rapid development of nanocarrier technology, the combination of gene therapy and nanodelivery systems has broadened the therapeutic application of molecular biology and the medical application of biological nanomaterials. Nanoparticles can be used as potential drug-delivery vehicles for the treatment of hereditary and infectious diseases. In addition, due to the advantages of lung immunity, such as rapid onset of action, good efficacy, and reduced adverse reactions, pulmonary delivery of nucleic acid vaccine has become a hot spot in the field of research. In recent years, lipid nanocarriers have become safe, efficient, and ideal materials for vaccine delivery due to their unique physical and chemical properties, which can effectively reduce the toxic side effects of drugs and achieve the effect of slow release and controlled release, and there have been a large number of studies using lipid nanocarriers to efficiently deliver target components into the body. Based on the delivery of tuberculosis (TB) nucleic acid vaccine by lipid carrier, this article systematically reviews the advantages and mechanism of liposomes as a nucleic acid vaccine delivery carrier, so as to lay a solid foundation for the faster and more effective development of new anti-TB vaccine delivery systems in the future.",0
"Aim: Wilms’ tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP), plays a part in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, it is not yet known how WTAP affects cancer progression by influencing leukocyte rich repeat containing proteins (NLR) – family members 3 (NLRP3) – related inflammasomes.Materials & methods: We first validated the expression of WTAP in CRC at the tissue and cellular levels. Subsequently, by transfecting si-NC and si-WTAP into cells, we verified functions of WTAP in proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of CRC cells. Finally, we analyzed the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of NLRP3 by WTAP using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR technology, confirming that WTAP mediated the repression of NLRP3 inflammasome and the malignant progression of tumor cells.Results: WTAP was substantially upregulated in CRC tissues and cells. WTAP reinforced the migration, proliferation and invasion ability of CRC cells, and repressed apoptosis. Mechanistically, WTAP mediated the m6A modification of NLRP3, which suppressed the expression of NLRP3 and dampened the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis activation as well as pyroptosis, thereby facilitating the malignant progression of CRC.Conclusion: WTAP mediates m6A modification to modulate the repression of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis in pyroptosis, reinforcing the malignant progression of CRC.","AbstractBackgroundUV-related DNA damage signature (UVsig) is highly specific for cutaneous cancers. The prevalence of UVsig among tumors without a primary site and tumors of extracutaneous origin were previously reported, suggesting potential misclassification of cancers. Our study aims to assess if the knowledge of UVsig at diagnosis would change first-line treatment recommendation.MethodsThe main outcome was the potential clinical impact (PCI) of UVsig. High PCI was defined as UVsig leading to change in diagnosis and first-line therapy. Medium PCI was a change in diagnosis, but appropriate therapy was offered. Low PCI group had diagnosis modified by clinicians and treated as cutaneous cancer independently of UVsig.ResultsAmong 5565 cases, 650 (12%) were positive for a UVsig. In the cancer of unknown primary group: 20 (49%), 9 (22%), and 12 (29%) cases were categorized in the high, medium, and low PCI group, respectively. In the cancer of extracutaneous origin cohort: 22 (54%), 15 (36%), and 4 (10%) cases were high, medium, and low PCI, respectively. The diagnosis would have changed in 14% of Veterans with UVsig positive tumor. Among all high PCI cases, 37 (88%) received chemotherapy that was not indicated based on a UVsig-informed diagnosis of cutaneous malignancy.ConclusionOur study suggested that UVsig would lead to revision of the working clinical diagnosis and significantly alter the first-line treatment in at least half of cancers of unknown primary or extracutaneous origin with UVsig. Knowledge of UVsig could lead to more effective and less toxic therapy for patients with cancer.",0
"PurposeThis study was conducted to investigate impacts of potential anticancer (associated with apoptosis and caspase pathways) of two newly synthesized derivatives of pillararene, named as d-Q-P5 and p-Q-P5, on Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) cells.Materials and methodsThe MTT method was used to determine the IC50 doses of the derivatives on HNSCC cells, and the changes in gene expression were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The apoptosis change was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis.ResultsThe results showed that the d-Q-P5 and p-Q-P5 effectively inhibited the proliferation of the cells by upregulating proapoptotic genes (Bax, Bad, p53, Bak, and Apaf-1) and genes involved in the caspase pathway (Casp2, Casp3, and Casp9), while downregulating the antiapoptotic gene (Bcl-2).ConclusionsThis study is the first to demonstrate the potential anticancer effects of these two agents on HNSCC cells by positively regulating apoptosis gene expression.","Natural killer cells are critical players in the antitumor immune response due to their ability to destroy target cells through cytotoxic activity and other means. However, this response is inhibited in the tumor microenvironment, where a crippling hypoxic environment and several inhibitory molecules bind to NK cells to trigger an anergic state. Inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, NK2GA, KIR, TIGIT, and LAG-3 have been associated with inhibition of NK cells in multiple cancer types. Binding to these receptors leads to loss of cytotoxicity, lower proliferation and metabolic rates, and even apoptosis. While these receptors are important for avoiding auto-immunity, in a pathological setting like malignant neoplasms they are disadvantageous for the individual’s immune system to combat cancer cells. The use of monoclonal antibodies to block these receptors contributes to cancer therapy by preventing the inhibition of NK cells. In this review, the impact of NK cell inhibition and activation on cancer therapy was summarized and an overview of the blockade of inhibitory pathways by monoclonal antibodies was provided.",0
"Introduction: The combination of atezolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), and bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, is the first choice for systemic therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. Immune-related cardiovascular toxicity—myocarditis and pericarditis—are known to occur during ICI treatment. By contrast, VEGF inhibitors (VEGFIs) cause cardiovascular complications such as hypertension and heart failure. Thus, different cardiovascular toxicities have been recognized for ICIs and VEGFIs, but the impact of their combination remains unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the cardiovascular toxicity profile of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab using the World Health Organization adverse event reporting database—VigiBase. Methods: We analyzed data included in VigiBase till December 2022. To evaluate the frequency of reports related to atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and their combinations for 21 adverse events, we calculated the reporting odds ratio and information component. Analyses of the fatality of various cardiovascular toxicities associated with the use of each drug were performed. Results: The database included 84,951, 10,595, and 2,092 reports of treatment with bevacizumab, atezolizumab, and their combination, respectively. The disproportionality signal of hypertension, arterial embolism and thrombosis, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, heart failure, myocarditis, hemorrhage-related clinical events, venous embolism and thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure with combination regimen of atezolizumab and bevacizumab was detected. Signals of these adverse events were also detected treatment with either atezolizumab or bevacizumab alone. Venous embolism and thrombosis exhibited the highest fatality rate in the two drug combination (12.82%) relative to those of atezolizumab (6.19%) and bevacizumab (4.54%). Discussion: Cardiovascular toxicity, owing to the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, was similar to that of each single agent, and no new safety concerns were observed. Caution should be exercised when combining the two drugs since the fatality rate of thromboembolism increases with combination treatment.","AbstractBackgroundGlioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary central nervous system tumor characterized by poor outcomes. In case of relapse or progression to adjuvant chemotherapy, there is no univocal preferred regimen for relapsing glioblastoma.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and Bayesian trial-level network meta-analyses (NMA) to identify the regimens associated with the best outcomes. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR). We estimated separate treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values. Only phase II/III prospective comparative trials were included.ResultsTwenty-four studies (3733 patients and 27 different therapies) were ultimately included. Twenty-three different regimens were compared for OS, 21 for PFS, and 26 for ORR. When taking lomustine as a common comparator, only regorafenib was likely to be significantly superior in terms of OS (hazard ratio: 0.50, 95% credible interval: 0.33-0.75). Regorafenib was significantly superior to other 16 (69.6%) regimens, including NovoTTF-100A, bevacizumab monotherapy, and several bevacizumab-based combinations. Regarding PFS and ORR, no treatment was clearly superior to the others.ConclusionsThis NMA supports regorafenib as one of the best available options for relapsing/refractory glioblastoma. Lomustine, NovoTTF-100A, and bevacizumab emerge as other viable alternative regimens. However, evidence on regorafenib is controversial at best. Moreover, most studies were underpowered, with varying inclusion criteria and primary endpoints, and no longer adapted to the most recent glioblastoma classification. A paradigmatic change in clinical trials’ design for relapsing/refractory glioblastoma and more effective treatments are urgently required.",1
"PurposeThe aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical impact of skeletal muscle area (SMA) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors.MethodsUnivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on data of 103 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors. The SMA was measured at the level of the third lumbar vertebral (L3) on computed tomography images using OsiriX software (32-bit, version 5.8; OsiriX, Geneva, Switzerland). The L3 muscle index (cm2/m2) was defined as the SMA (cm2) at the L3 level divided by the height (m) squared.ResultsL3 muscle index Low was an independent predictor of both progression-free (P = 0.0399) and overall survival (P = 0.0155). Moreover, the disease control rate was significantly lower in the L3 muscle index Low group (49.0% [25/51]) than in the L3 muscle index High group (73.1% [38/52]; P = 0.0117). However, there was no significant difference between the response rates of the L3 muscle index Low group (21.6% [11/51]) and L3 muscle index High group (32.7% [17/52]; P = 0.2031).ConclusionsL3 muscle index Low is an independent predictor of worse outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03146-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",Herein we recount the legacy of Sir David Roxbee Cox (15 July 1924 – 18 January 2022) from the perspective of practicing clinicians. His pioneering work in developing the logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression models revolutionized the analysis and interpretation of categorical and time-to-event survival outcomes in modern medicine.

"Ferroptosis and immune response correlation studies have not been reported in prostate cancer (PCa), and the main goal of this paper is to identify biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Data on PCa were retrieved from the TCGA and MSKCC2010 databases. Thereafter, the differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DE-FRGs: ACSF2) and immune-related genes (DE-IRGs: ANGPT1, NPPC, and PTGDS) were identified using the “limma” package. Additionally, we used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to obtain biochemical relapse (BCR)-free survival-related genes and construct a risk signature. Patients with high-risk scores were characterized by poor BCR-free survival, relatively low immune cell abundance, and comparably weak expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Moreover, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was performed to explore the biological pathways related to the risk signature. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGESA) was applied to evaluate the status of immune cells in patients with PCa, which demonstrated that the risk score was intimately affiliated with immune response and cancer pathways. Ultimately, the connection between the risk score and response of PCa patients to immunotherapy was appraised using the TIDE algorithm. The TIDE algorithm implied that the high-risk score PCa population might benefit more from immunotherapy regimens. Finally, qRT-PCR were used to evaluate the expression of DE-FRGs and DE-IRGs in PCa cell and normal prostate epithelial cells. The result of qRT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of ACSF2, ANGPT1, NPPC, and PTGDS in normal prostate epithelial cell were higher than that in PCa cells. Therefore, a risk score model was generated based on one DE-FRG and three DE-IRGs, which could predict the BCR-free survival and response of immunotherapy for patients with PCa.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12033-024-01293-5.","ObjectiveIn recent decades, studies have underscored nuclear proteins and signaling pathways in prostate cancer (PCa) development. Key biomarkers like Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) are expressed in both healthy and malignant prostate cells. This study aimed to demonstrate the relationship between pathological characteristics, survival, recurrence, and tissue expression of EZH2 and FOXM1 in high-risk PCa patients.MethodsPCa tissues were used in a retrospective analysis that spanned from September 2009 to August 2019. Inclusion criteria comprised pathological tumor stage (pT) 3 patients with positive surgical margins or tumor proximity to inked margins within 5 mm. After case selection, tissue slides were stained for EZH2 and FOXM1 antibodies, and Allred scores were calculated. Patients or relatives of deceased patients were contacted for signed agreements and disease follow-ups.ResultsThe pT3b, ductal carcinoma component, and moderate EZH2 expression were associated with relapse (odds ratio [OR] 6.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41–27.27, p=0.016; OR 7.29, 95% CI 1.03–51.43, p=0.046; OR 5.96, 95% CI 1.09–32.48, p=0.039; respectively). The unilateral and bilateral seminal vesicle invasion increased the likelihood of recurrence by 9.98 times and 5.36 times, and the risk of death by around 9.78 times and 10.79 times, respectively. The pT3b was linked to higher death likelihood (OR 7.16, 95% CI 1.38–37.23, p=0.019), while moderate EZH2 expression did not show statistical significance (OR 4.54, 95% CI 0.87–23.60, p=0.072, marginally). Pathological regional lymph node stage (pN) 1 had significantly higher probability of mortality than pN unknown (3.9% vs. 27%, p<0.001). PCa in the neck and apex of the prostate gland increased death risk tenfold.ConclusionSufficient immunoexpression of EZH2, ductal carcinoma component, and neoplastic proliferation in the seminal vesicles, apex and neck of the prostate gland correlates with elevated risks of recurrence and mortality. Clinicians should use these criteria for appropriate patient referrals, and a multicenter trial could provide accurate classifications.",1
"AbstractIrreversible electroporation (IRE) is a minimally invasive ablation technique that compromises integrity of the cell membrane through the application of short duration, high voltage electric pulses to induce cell death. Adverse effects of IRE such as muscle contractions are reduced with higher frequency biphasic pulsing, commonly known as high-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE). IRE and H-FIRE treatments have shown to increase immune activation through the induction of both immediate and delayed cell death, indicated by the release of damage-associated molecular pathways, antigens, and proteins. In this study, we demonstrated that specific modes of cell death can be elicited by modifying the applied pulse width and electric field strength of various waveforms. Several assays were performed on a human glioblastoma cell line, seeded onto a 2D monolayer for electroporation treatments. Cleavage of Caspase 3/7 and Caspase 1, well-known indicators of apoptosis and pyroptosis, respectively, was quantified. Our results indicate that apoptotic activity was increased for shorter pulse widths and stronger electric fields, whereas pyroptotic activity displayed opposite trends being significantly dominant with longer pulse widths at lower applied electric fields. When clinically applied, the activation of specific cell death mechanisms can allow for controlling the extent of an electroporation-mediated immune response and subsequently improved overall patient survival. With this information, we could use an electrode array to spatially manipulate the elicited immune response for patient-specific treatments.","Apoptosis is the most prominent mode of programmed cell death and is necessary for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During cell apoptosis, a distinctive population of extracellular vesicles is generated, termed apoptotic vesicles (apoVs). ApoVs inherit a variety of biological molecules such as proteins, RNAs, nuclear components, lipids, and gasotransmitters from their parent cells. ApoVs have shown promising therapeutic potential for inflammation, tumors, immune disorders, and tissue regeneration. In addition, apoVs can be used as drug carriers, vaccine development, and disease diagnosis. Recently, apoVs have been used in clinical trials to treat a variety of diseases, such as temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis and the regeneration of functional alveolar bone. Here, we review the history of apoV research, current preclinical and clinical studies, and the potential issues of apoV application.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells form dynamic immunological synapses with their cancer cell targets. After a CAR-antigen engagement, the CAR-T synapse forms, matures, and finally disassembles, accompanied by substantial remodeling of cell surface proteins, lipids, and glycans. In this review, we provide perspectives for understanding protein distribution, membrane topology, and force transmission across the CAR-T synapse. We highlight the features of CAR-T synapses that differ from T cell receptor synapses, including the disorganized protein pattern, adjustable synapse width, diverse mechano-responding properties, and resulting signaling consequences. Through a range of examples, we illustrate how revealing the biophysical nature of the CAR-T synapse could guide the design of CAR-Ts with improved anti-tumor function.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are uniquely capable of transporting tumoral antigens to tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs), and also interact with effector T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) itself, mediating both natural antitumor immunity and the response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Using LIPSTIC (Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts)-based single-cell transcriptomics, we identify individual DCs capable of presenting antigen to CD4+ T cells in the tdLN as well as inside the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our findings reveal that DCs with similar hyperactivated transcriptional phenotypes interact with helper T cells both within tumors and in the tdLN, and that checkpoint blockade drugs enhance these interactions. These findings show that a relatively small fraction of DCs is responsible for most of the antigen presentation within the tdLN and TME to both CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific T cells and that classical checkpoint blockade enhances CD40-driven DC activation at both sites.",0
"Background.In this study, we compared programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in primary tissue samples and its soluble form (sPD-L1) concentration in matched preoperative plasma samples from gastric cancer patients to understand the relationship between tissue and plasma PD-L1 expression and to determine its diagnostic and prognostic value.Methods.PD-L1 expression in tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and sPD-L1 concentration in plasma was quantified by ELISA. The levels of the CD274 gene, which encodes for PD-L1 protein, were examined as part of bulk tissue RNA-sequencing analyses. Additionally, we evaluated the association between sPD-L1 levels and various laboratory parameters, disease characteristics, and patient outcomes.Results.GC patients had significantly higher levels of sPD-L1 in their plasma (71.69 pg/mL) compared to healthy controls (35.34 pg/mL) (p<0.0001). Moreover, sPD-L1 levels were significantly correlated with tissue PD-L1 protein, CD274 mRNA expression, larger tumor size, advanced tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis. Elevated sPD-L1 levels (>103.5 ng/mL) were associated with poor overall survival (HR=2.16, 95%CI 1.15–4.08, p=0.017). Furthermore, intratumoral neutrophil and dendritic cell levels were directly correlated with plasma sPD-L1 concentration in the GC patients.Conclusions.sPD-L1 was readily measurable in GC patients, and its level was associated with GC tissue PD-L1 expression, greater immune cell infiltration, disease progression, and survival. Thus, sPD-L1 may be a useful minimally invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in GC patients.","AbstractPurposeHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is a critical biomarker in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). While the role of HER2-positive tumors in guiding targeted therapies is well-established, the clinical implications of HER2-low expression, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization-negative (ISH-negative), remain undetermined. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance and clinicopathological features of HER2-low AGC.Patients and methodsThis retrospective analysis involved patients with AGC treated with first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy from 2011 to 2020. Patients were categorized into HER2-zero (HER2 IHC 0), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-negative), and HER2-positive (IHC 2+/ISH-positive or 3+) groups.ResultsAmong 548 patients analyzed, 33.0%, 45.1%, and 21.8% were classified as HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive, respectively. The proportions of male patients, intestinal-type histology, esophagogastric junction/cardia involvement, metastatic disease status, ≥2 metastatic sites, liver metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and high serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels were gradually elevated in the HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive groups. Overall survival (median) was 13.8, 13.6, and 23.0 months, respectively, with a non-significant trend favoring HER2-positive over HER2-low (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.80; P = .0672). A delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival between the HER2-zero and HER2-low groups was observed, without reaching statistical significance (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.12; P = .2568).ConclusionPatients with HER2-low status exhibited intermediate and specific clinicopathological features within the HER2-negative category. In terms of prognosis, HER2-low patients showed a worsening trend compared with HER2-positive patients. This evidence implies that HER2-low status represents a distinct clinical subset, bridging the gap between the HER2-zero and HER2-positive profiles.",1
"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for adrenal gland metastasis, with a focus on the assessment of the irradiated subjects’ endocrinological function.Materials and methodsA total of 36 patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2020 in this prospective phase II trial. Patients were treated with Linac-based SBRT, with a dose of 45 Gy in 3 consecutive fractions. Primary end-point was local control (LC) of the treated lesions and secondary end-points included evaluation of acute and late toxicity, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and the impact on the hormonal production of adrenal glands.ResultsWith a median follow-up of 9.5 months, LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 94.7% and 88.4%, respectively. Rates of PFS at 1 and 2 years were 50.5% and 29.8%, with a median PFS of 14.7 months. Rates of OS at 1 and 2 years were 62.9% and 44.1%. At univariate analysis, oligorecurrence was associated with better OS compared to oligoprogressive or synchronous metastatic disease. No grade 3 or greater toxicities were registered and only a minority of patients (22.2%) reported mild treatment-related side effects. Hormonal and electrolytes production was assessed before and after treatment, showing only a slight and transient variation within the reference ranges.ConclusionSBRT on adrenal metastases has been confirmed to be a feasible and effective treatment. With an excellent disease control and the preservation of the endocrine function, SBRT with ablative dose can be considered a viable alternative to more invasive approaches.","In this retrospective study, MET inhibitor therapy demonstrated better survival outcomes compared with other treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Furthermore, MET ex14 skipping mutations and/or MET amplification typically occurred in the absence of other oncogenic driver mutations. With recent approvals of METi for patients with MET ex14 NSCLC, there is a need to identify more patients for treatment with METi to improve survival outcomes.Background:We evaluated the disease and patient characteristics, treatment, and MET testing patterns, predictive biomarkers and survival outcomes in patients with MET-dysregulated metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting.Patients and Methods:This was a multinational, retrospective, noninterventional chart review study. Data from medical records of patients with advanced/metastatic EGFR wild-type, MET-dysregulated NSCLC (December 2017-September 2018) were abstracted into electronic data collection forms.Results:Overall, 211 patient charts were included in this analysis; 157 patients had MET exon 14 skipping mutations (MET ex14; with or without concomitant MET amplification) and 54 had MET amplification only. All patients were tested for MET ex14, whereas MET amplification was evaluated in 168 patients. No overlap was reported between MET dysregulation and ALK, ROS1 or RET rearrangements, or HER2 exon 20 insertions. Overall, 56 of 211 patients (26.5%) received MET inhibitor (METi) therapy in any treatment-line setting (31.2% in the MET ex14 cohort; 13% in the MET-amplified only cohort). In the MET ex14 cohort, median OS in patients receiving METi was 25.4 months versus 10.7 months in patients who did not (HR [95% CI]: 0.532 [0.340–0.832]; P = .0055). In the MET-amplified only cohort, median OS was 20.6 months in patients treated with METi compared with 7.6 months in those without METi (HR [95% CI]: 0.388 [0.152–0.991]; P = .0479).Conclusions:MET alterations in NSCLC typically occur in the absence of other oncogenic driver mutations and are associated with poor survival outcomes. Notably, METi therapies are associated with improved survival outcomes in patients with MET-dysregulated NSCLC.",0
"Background:Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early-stage breast cancer (EBC) is a heterogenous disease. Identification of better clinical and molecular biomarkers is essential to guide optimal therapy for each patient.Patients and methods:We analyzed rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) for patients with HR+/HER2-negative EBC in eight neoadjuvant arms in the I-SPY2 trial by clinical/molecular features: age, stage, histology, percentage estrogen receptor (ER) positivity, ER/progesterone receptor status, MammaPrint (MP)-High1 (0 to −0.57) versus MP-High2 (<−0.57), BluePrint (BP)-Luminal-type versus BP-Basal-type, and ImPrint immune signature. We quantified the clinical/molecular heterogeneity, assessed overlap among these biomarkers, and evaluated associations with pCR and DRFS.Results:Three hundred and seventy-nine patients with HR+/HER2-negative EBC were included in this analysis, with an observed pCR rate of 17% across treatment arms. pCR rates were higher in patients with stage II versus III disease (21% versus 9%, P = 0.0013), ductal versus lobular histology (19% versus 11%, P = 0.049), lower %ER positivity (≤66% versus >66%) (35% versus 9%, P = 3.4E-09), MP-High2 versus MP-High1 disease (31% versus 11%, P = 1.1E-05), BP-Basal-type versus BP-Luminal-type disease (34% versus 10%, P = 1.62E-07), and ImPrint-positive versus -negative disease (38% versus 10%, P = 1.64E-09). Patients with lower %ER were more likely to have MP-High2 and BP-Basal-type disease. At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, patients who achieved pCR had excellent outcomes irrespective of clinical/molecular features. Among patients who did not achieve pCR, DRFS events were more frequent in patients with MP-High2 and BP-Basal-type disease than those with MP-High1 and BP-Luminal-type disease.Conclusions:Among patients with high molecular-risk HR+/HER2-negative EBC, the MP-High2, BP-Basal-type, and ImPrint-positive signatures identified a partially overlapping subset of patients who were more likely to achieve Pcr in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± targeted agents or immunotherapy compared to patients with MP-High1, BP-Luminal-type, and ImPrint-negative disease. I-SPY2.2 is incorporating the use of these biomarkers to molecularly define specific patient populations and optimize treatment selection.","BackgroundMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, and 30% of patients with thymoma often have myasthenia gravis. Patients with thymoma-associated MG (TAMG) have many different clinical presentations compared to non-MG thymoma (NMG), yet their gene expression differences remain unclear.ObjectiveIn this study, we analyzed the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and analyzed their regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) in TAMG, which will further clarify the possible pathogenesis of TAMG.MethodsDEGs were calculated using the RNA-sequencing data of TAMG and NMG downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. R software was then used to analyze the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of DEGs, while STRING was applied to build the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Cytoscape to identify and visualize the hub genes. Immune infiltration significances of hub genes were also explored by using the TIMER database and TCGA database. Upstream microRNAs (miRNAs) of the hub genes were predicted by online software.ResultsWe comparatively analyzed the gene expression differences between TAMG and NMG groups. A total of 977 DEGs were identified between the two groups (|log fold change (FC)| >2, adjusted P value <0.050), with 555 down-regulated genes and 422 up-regulated genes. Five top hub genes (CTNNB1, EGFR, SOX2, ERBB2, and EGF) were recognized in the PPI network. Analysis based on the TIMER and TCGA databases suggested that 5 hub genes were correlated with multiple immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoint-related markers, such as PDCD1, CTLA-4, and CD274, in TAMG patients. Lastly, 5 miRNAs were identified to have the potential function of regulating the hub gene expression.ConclusionOur study identified 5 hub genes (CTNNB1, EGFR, SOX2, ERBB2, and EGF) and their 5 regulatory miRNAs in TAMG, and the hub genes were correlated with multiple immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoint-related markers. Our findings could help partially clarify the pathophysiology of TAMG, which could be new potential targets for subsequent clinical immunotherapy.",0
"PurposeThis study aimed to develop a machine learning–based approach to identify prognostic gene signatures for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) using next-generation sequencing data from Asian populations.Materials and MethodsWe utilized next-generation sequencing data to analyze gene expression profiles and identify potential biomarkers. Our methodology involved integrating various machine learning techniques, including feature selection and model optimization. We employed logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to validate the identified gene signatures.ResultsWe identified a gene signature significantly associated with relapse in TNBC patients. The predictive model demonstrated robustness and accuracy, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9087, sensitivity of 0.8750, and specificity of 0.9231. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a strong association between the gene signature and patient relapse, further validated by logistic regression analysis.ConclusionThis study presents a novel machine learning-based prognostic tool for TNBC, offering significant implications for early detection and personalized treatment. The identified gene signature provides a promising approach for improving the management of TNBC, contributing to the advancement of precision oncology.","PurposeOral cancer is a significant global health concern, with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in regions with prevalent tobacco usage such as Asia. Majority of oral cancers are detected at an advanced stage resulting in poor survival outcomes. Moreover, the treatment modalities of oral cancers have remained constant with surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy being mainstays of the treatment. This review provides a significant progress made in understanding the molecular landscape of oral cancers and the evolution of therapeutic strategies toward precision medicine.MethodsA comprehensive literature review was conducted to gather recent studies on the molecular landscape of oral cancers, genomic insights, and clinical trials.ResultsFirstly, genomic insights into oral cancers, including key driver mutations and copy number alterations, are discussed in the context of personalized medicine approaches. Subsequently, advancements in therapeutic strategies, particularly focusing on clinical trials investigating immunotherapy and targeted agents, are highlighted.ConclusionDespite promising results, challenges persist in identifying reliable biomarkers for treatment response and resistance. Continued research efforts are warranted to validate biomarkers and optimize therapeutic interventions, with the goal of enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of oral cancer.",1
"AbstractRecent interest has been in using mIDH inhibitors in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas. This review paper summarizes the indications, side effects, recommended dosing, and management for patients on ivosidenib and vorasidenib.","PurposeCancer vaccine (CV) has thrived as a promising tool for cancer prevention and treatment. However, how to maintain the integrity and diversity of individualized vaccine antigens and activate the adaptive immune system is still challenging.MethodsHerein, a preventive and therapeutic vaccine platform for in situ effective multi-model synergistic therapy is developed. In our study, we process B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen (LNF) to obtain LNF cells, the characterization of LNF cells were conducted. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect and immune activation ability were studied, and the role as a CV were investigated.ResultsThe LNF cells preserve intact cellular structure and tumor-associated self-antigen gp100. Moreover, LNF cells have the ability of loading and releasing doxorubicin (DOX). Except for the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy brought by DOX, the LNF cells can promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and induce immune response by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly with the existence of adjuvant, R848. Specifically, the CD8+ T cells of mice in LNF-DOX/R848 group are 6 times of that in PBS group in tumor microenvironment, and twice in spleen. Therefore, LNF cells can also be utilized as a CV. Vaccination with LNF/R848 cells effectively suppress the tumor growth in mice by fivefold as compared to the control group.ConclusionIn this work, we obtain the LNF cells with a simple procedure. The LNF cells not only provides a tumor cells-based multi-modal system for cancer therapy but inspires new insights into future development of individualized CVs strategies.Graphical AbstractThis study processes live B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen to obtain LNF cells, which preserve cell integrity and homologous targeting ability. The LNF cells can load and deliver drug and can serve as tumor vaccine. Results demonstrated the LNF cells have effective prophylactic ability, and ideal anti-tumor ability with the loaded drug and adjuvant.

"Plain Language SummaryPatients with both BRAF V600E mutations and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have poor prognosis. Currently, there are no specifically targeted first-line treatment options indicated for patients with mCRC whose tumors harbor both molecular aberrations. Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of MSI-H/dMMR mCRC, and the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib, in combination with cetuximab, is approved for previously treated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. Combination of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab may synergistically enhance antitumor activity in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR mCRC. SEAMARK is a randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab versus pembrolizumab alone in patients with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR mCRC.Plain language summary – SEAMARK study: encorafenib & cetuximab plus pembrolizumab for people with BRAF V600E-mutant & DNA repair-deficient colorectal cancerColorectal cancer (CRC) occurs when there is an abnormal growth of cells (known as a tumor) in the colon or rectum. Some people with CRC have changes in their tumor genes (known as gene mutations). A gene is a piece of DNA that tells the cell to make specific molecules, such as proteins. Mutations in a gene called BRAF can turn on signals that help the cancer cells grow. Gene mutations that impair DNA repair mechanisms can also make the cancer cells grow more quickly and allow the immune system to detect the cancer cells as being foreign to the body. Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that turns off specific genes and proteins involved in cancer cell survival and growth. BRAF and EGFR inhibitors are targeted therapies that work well together in treating people with BRAF-mutant CRC. BRAF proteins can help cancer cells grow, and BRAF inhibitors block these proteins to prevent, slow, or stop the growth of the cancer cells. Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps a person’s immune system fight cancer. Immunotherapy is effective for treating CRC that has mutations in the DNA repair mechanisms. By combining targeted therapy and immunotherapy, patients may be able to live longer without their disease getting worse. In the SEAMARK study, we will use a treatment combination including a BRAF inhibitor (encorafenib), an EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab) and an immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) in patients with CRC who have a BRAF mutation and deficiencies in the DNA repair mechanism.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05217446 (ClinicalTrials.gov), 2021-003715-26 (EudraCT) Tweetable abstract SEAMARK (NCT05217446) is a phase II study investigating the efficacy of pembrolizumab with encorafenib and cetuximab in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.","Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging criteria, clinical guidelines provide tutorials to clinical management of liver cancer at their individual stages. However, most patients diagnosed with liver cancer are at advanced stage; therefore, many researchers conduct investigations on targeted therapy, aiming to improve the overall survival of these patients. To date, small-molecule-based targeted therapies are highly recommended (first line: sorafenib and lenvatinib; second line: regorafenib and cabozantinib) by current the clinical guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Herein, we summarize the small-molecule-based targeted therapies in liver cancer, including the approved and preclinical therapies as well as the therapies under clinical trials, and introduce their history of discovery, clinical trials, indications, and molecular mechanisms. For drug resistance, the revealed mechanisms of action and the combination therapies are also discussed. In fact, the known small-molecule-based therapies still have limited clinical benefits to liver cancer patients. Therefore, we analyze the current status and give our ideas for the urgent issues and future directions in this field, suggesting clues for novel techniques in liver cancer treatment.",1
"Lung cancer continues to be the third leading cause of cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths. As the field of interventional oncology continues to grow, interventional radiologists are increasingly treating lung cancer patients. Involvement begins with tissue diagnosis for which biomarkers and immunohistochemistry are used to guide selective and advanced medical therapies. An interventional radiologist must be aware of the rationale behind tissue diagnosis and techniques to minimize biopsy complications. Staging is an important part of tumor board conversations and drives treatment pathways. Surgical therapy remains the gold standard for early-stage disease but with an aging population the need for less invasive treatments such as radiation therapy and ablation continue to grow. The interventionalist must be aware of the indications, techniques, and pre- and posttherapy managements for percutaneous ablation. Endovascular therapy is broadly divided into therapeutic treatment of lung cancer, which is gaining traction, and treatment of lung cancer complications such as hemoptysis. This review aims to provide a good basis for interventional radiologists treating lung cancer patients.","Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies are emerging in the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as the dominant ablative approach as an alternative to surgery for primary breast cancer in patients who do not wish to have surgery or are poor surgical candidates. Cryoablation is well tolerated and provides excellent local control and cosmesis. Thermal ablation may also be used in the treatment of oligometastatic breast cancer, allowing patients to achieve long disease-free intervals. Transarterial therapies have been studied in the treatment of oligoprogressive hepatic metastasis, though further supportive data would be helpful to demonstrate its efficacy.",1
"AbstractBackgroundCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is characterized by a high tumor mutational burden due to solar damage and a favorable response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Yet, we encounter tumors arising in areas with minimal sun exposure, such as cSCC that develops in chronically inflamed skin, also known as Marjolin’s Ulcer (MU). The response of MU-SCC to immunotherapy remains unknown.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with cSCC and treated with cemiplimab or pembrolizumab in a single tertiary medical center. Patients lost to follow up were excluded.ResultsOf the 84 eligible patients, 9 (11%) had MU-SCC. Of these, 2 (22%) reached partial response (PR), and none reached complete response (CR). In contrast, of the 75 patients with solar damage-related cSCC, 40 had PR (53%), and 20 had CR (26%). The difference between the two subtypes was significant (P < .001). Interestingly, 3 patients with MU-SCC received a second-line chemo-immunotherapy and experienced a partial response that continued for 5 to 21 months. Patients with MU-SCC had a significantly shorter median time to progression (TTP) (1.6 vs 51.6 months, P < .001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (1.6 vs 15.4 months, P < .001). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly shorter (17.4 vs 36.7 months, P = .096). Multivariate analysis confirmed that MU-SCC is an independent risk factor for shorter TTP (HR 5.5, 95% CI 2.2-14.0, P < .001) and PFS (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.5-8.1, P = .003).ConclusionsThis study suggests that immunotherapy is less beneficial in SCC-MU. More work is needed to verify our findings and explore other treatment options.","PurposeApproximately 5% of patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) may develop recurrent or metastatic disease. The management of such cases is challenging and requires multi-disciplinary care. Immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibition was approved to treat unresectable or metastatic CSCC in 2018. Given limited data regarding clinical outcomes outside of published trials, we describe our experience using this therapy.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with PD-1 inhibition as therapy for locally advanced, regionally metastatic or distant metastatic CSCC at the University of Southern California. Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment data using PD-1 inhibitors, and outcomes were assessed.ResultsAmong 26 patients treated with PD-1 inhibition, the objective response rate was 42.3%, with 19.2% of patients having partial response and 23.1% having complete response to therapy. The median progression-free survival was 5.4 months. Median tumor mutational burden (TMB) was higher among responders compared to non-responders (60 vs. 9 Mut/Mb, p = 0.04). Primary CSCC tumor location on the head/neck was also associated with response to PD-1 inhibition (p = 0.04). Two patients with mutations affecting mismatch repair deficiency were noted to have complete response to treatment. No other variables were associated with treatment outcomes.ConclusionPD-1 inhibition produces durable responses among patients with advanced or metastatic CSCC. PD-1 inhibition therapy is well tolerated, but patients should be monitored closely for immune-related adverse events, particularly frail or immune-suppressed patients. Further investigation of potential biomarkers to help identify patients who will derive the most benefit from this therapeutic option is needed.",1
"Aim: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers. Research in various cancers suggests that investigating target biomarkers may provide directions to precision medicine. However, expression of biomarkers varies across different populations. The biomarker profile of Pakistani patients with PDAC remains unexplored.Materials & methods: We conducted a study on 109 patients to analyze a panel of four proteins (KRAS, p53, BRCA1 and APC) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples. After confirmation of diagnosis and appropriate tumor content, tissues were processed with antibody specific immunohistochemistry experiments. Subsequently, independent microscopic observation was conducted by two pathologists using scoring criteria specific for each antibody.Results: Statistical analysis showed that negative expression of p53 was significantly associated with positive expression of BRCA1 (p = 0.000) and APC (p = 0.007). The expression of BRCA1 was also found significantly associated with APC (p = 0.028). None of the protein showed association with overall survival or patient demographics. Moreover, KRAS expression was shown to be significantly associated with perineural invasion (p = 0.005).Conclusion: This is the first study that investigates protein biomarker expression in a large cohort of Pakistani PDAC patients. The findings from the study may provide directions about the population specific biomarkers and targeted therapies for these patients.","AbstractPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) manifests diverse molecular subtypes, including the classical/progenitor and basal-like/squamous subtypes, with the latter known for its aggressiveness. We employed integrative transcriptome and metabolome analyses to identify potential genes contributing to the molecular subtype differentiation and its metabolic features. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that adrenoceptor alpha 2A (ADRA2A) was downregulated in the basal-like/squamous subtype, suggesting its potential role as a candidate suppressor of this subtype. Reduced ADRA2A expression was significantly associated with a high frequency of lymph node metastasis, higher pathological grade, advanced disease stage, and decreased survival among PDAC patients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ADRA2A transgene expression and ADRA2A agonist inhibited PDAC cell invasion. Additionally, ADRA2A-high condition downregulated the basal-like/squamous gene expression signature, while upregulating the classical/progenitor gene expression signature in our PDAC patient cohort and PDAC cell lines. Metabolome analysis conducted on the PDAC cohort and cell lines revealed that elevated ADRA2A levels were associated with suppressed amino acid and carnitine/acylcarnitine metabolism, which are characteristic metabolic profiles of the classical/progenitor subtype. Collectively, our findings suggest that heightened ADRA2A expression induces transcriptome and metabolome characteristics indicative of classical/progenitor subtype with decreased disease aggressiveness in PDAC patients. These observations introduce ADRA2A as a candidate for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting in PDAC.",1
"Lung cancer treatment is evolving, and the role of senescent macrophages in tumor immune evasion has become a key focus. This study explores how senescent macrophages interact with lung cancer cells, contributing to tumor progression and immune dysfunction. As aging impairs macrophage functions, including phagocytosis and metabolic signaling, it promotes chronic inflammation and cancer development. p16INK4a-positive macrophages are common in aged mice, and their clearance slows tumor growth, suggesting these cells support tumor proliferation and immune evasion. Targeting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and reprogramming senescent macrophages offers potential therapeutic benefits, including reversing immune aging and boosting anti-tumor immunity. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires further molecular understanding and rigorous clinical trials.","Aim: The clinical efficacy of systemic chemotherapy is limited due to the nonspecific delivery of anticancer drugs and is associated with serious systemic adverse effects. Therefore, integrated treatment and comprehensive care are particularly important for postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer.Materials & methods: This study aimed to ascertain the application effect of multidisciplinary team (MDT)-style continuity of care combined with whole-process nutritional nursing in postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer. Nutritional indices, immune function, adverse emotions, self-efficacy, self-care ability, quality of life and toxic reactions during chemotherapy were recorded in postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer receiving routine care (control group) and MDT-style continuity of care combined with whole-process nutritional care (intervention group).Results: After care, the intervention group performed higher BMI, PA, TP and ALB, CD3+, CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+, lower levels of CD8+, lower self-rating anxiety scale, self-rating depression scale and QLQ-C30 symptom domain scores and higher general self-efficacy scale, exercise of self-care agency scale and QLQ-C30 functional domain scores versus the control group (all p < 0.05).Conclusion: MDT-style continuity of care combined with whole-process nutritional care can improve the nutritional status of postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer, and in turn enhance their quality of life.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDIntracranial metastases are common in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and their prognosis is very poor. Furthermore, intracranial progression is common during systemic therapy due to the inability to cross the blood brain barrier, but the impact of cancer immunotherapy on intracranial progression remains unclear. METHODSWe analyzed clinical data to evaluate the frequency of intracranial progression in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with PD-1 blockade therapies compared to patients not treated with PD-1 blockade therapies (Approval number: 2201-022). We also evaluated durable responses to PD-1 blockade and analyzed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes using tumor-rechallenging murine models. RESULTSThe clinical data analysis showed that the frequency of intracranial progression was significantly lower in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with PD-1 blockade than in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. In murine models, intracranial rechallenged tumors after initial rejection by PD-1 blockade therapy were suppressed, as observed for subcutaneous tumors. Accordingly, PD-1 blockade increased long-lived memory precursor effector T cells and antigen-specific T cells in intracranial lesions. In contrast, intracranial rechallenged different tumors were not suppressed. CONCLUSIONSThe CNS has been considered a site in which cancer patients tend to experience progression during systemic therapies, however our results indicate that cancer immunotherapies can prevent intracranial progression, maintaining long-term effects intracranially as well as systemically. (Kemmotsu N. et. al., Int J Cancer, 2024)","PurposeAging is closely related to the occurrence of many diseases, including cancer, and involves changes in the immune microenvironment. γδT cells are important components of resident lymphocytes in mucosal tissues. However, little is known about the effects that the aged lung has on γδT cells and their prognostic significance in non-small cell lung cancer.MethodsIn the current study, the expression of γδTCR and IL-17A was measured by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 168 patients with adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 144 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Furthermore, gene transcription patterns in LUAD and LUSC tumors and normal controls were extracted from TCGA and GTEx databases and were analyzed.ResultsHigh frequency of γδT cells was observed in patients with LUAD and LUSC, whereas the levels of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD56 + cells were decreased. Elevated γδT cells in tumors were mainly IL-17A-releasing γδT17 cells, which were found to be enriched in aged patients. High γδT cell levels positively corelated with the overall survival (OS) of patients, especially the 5-year OS in the elderly. Further analysis of gene transcription patterns indicated that increased expression of LTBR, HES1, RORC, CCR6, IL1, and IL23A may contribute to the transformation of the tumor microenvironment in a manner conducive to γδT17 cell development and differentiation. Finally, gene analysis between different age groups revealed that the expression of CCR6 and IL7 in LUAD, as well as Hes1, IL7, and IL23A in LUSC, were remarkably higher in elderly (age ≥ 60 years) than in younger individuals (age < 60 years).ConclusionOur findings suggest that intrinsic alterations in the aging lung lead to γδT17 cell enrichment, which subsequently may exert anti-tumor effects in the elderly.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03742-z.",0
"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to investigate and analyze the level of actual participation and perceived importance of shared decision-making on treatment and care of lung cancer patients, to compare their differences and to explore their influencing factors.MethodsA total of 290 lung cancer patients were collected from oncology and thoracic surgery departments of a comprehensive medical center in Qingdao from October 2018 to December 2019. Participants completed a cross-sectional questionnaire to assess their actual participation and perceived importance in shared decision-making on treatment and care. Descriptive analysis and non-parametric tests were carried out to assess the status quo of patients' shared decision-making on treatment and care. Binary logistic regression analysis with a stepwise back-wards was applied to predict factors that affected patients' participation in shared decision-making.ResultsThe results showed that patients with lung cancer had a low degree of participation in shared decision-making. There were significant differences between actual participation and perceived importance of shared decision-making on treatment and care. Education level, age, gender, income, marital status, personality, the course of the disease (> 6 months), and the pathological TNM staging (III) affected patient's level of participation in shared decision-making.ConclusionActual participation in shared decision-making on the treatment and care of lung cancer patients was low and considered unimportant. We could train oncology nurses to use patient decision aids to help patients and families participate in shared decision-making on patients’ value, preferences and needs.","PurposeThe aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical impact of skeletal muscle area (SMA) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors.MethodsUnivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on data of 103 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors. The SMA was measured at the level of the third lumbar vertebral (L3) on computed tomography images using OsiriX software (32-bit, version 5.8; OsiriX, Geneva, Switzerland). The L3 muscle index (cm2/m2) was defined as the SMA (cm2) at the L3 level divided by the height (m) squared.ResultsL3 muscle index Low was an independent predictor of both progression-free (P = 0.0399) and overall survival (P = 0.0155). Moreover, the disease control rate was significantly lower in the L3 muscle index Low group (49.0% [25/51]) than in the L3 muscle index High group (73.1% [38/52]; P = 0.0117). However, there was no significant difference between the response rates of the L3 muscle index Low group (21.6% [11/51]) and L3 muscle index High group (32.7% [17/52]; P = 0.2031).ConclusionsL3 muscle index Low is an independent predictor of worse outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03146-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibition therapy (ICIT) is an emerging field in oncology especially opening new horizons to chemotherapy refractory patients.

"AbstractIntroductionHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) holds high cancer mortality worldwide. Immunotherapy-based combination therapy, currently the first-line (1L) standard of care in advanced HCC, has shifted the treatment paradigm concerning both efficacy and safety outcomes. Data on immune-related adverse event surrogacy for efficacy outcomes are mixed.Case ReportWe report the case of a 58-year-old male with chronic hepatitis C virus infection who presented with a voluminous shoulder HCC metastasis. Albeit an initial significant biochemical response with 1L sorafenib, progressive disease after 3 months plus a bleeding complication led to treatment discontinuation. Second-line nivolumab, although yielding a rapid clinical and biochemical response, was permanently ceased after 12 weeks due to a grade 3 immune-related hepatitis. Notably, 5 years post-treatment, the patient sustains a major biochemical and radiographic response.DiscussionThis case highlights an unusual and sustained response to nivolumab treatment in HCC, following early treatment discontinuation due to severe hepatotoxicity.","Cytokeratin-positive interstitial reticulum cell (CIRC) tumor is an extremely rare malignant neoplasm and a subtype of fibroblastic reticular cell tumor, classified within the dendritic cell tumor group. We describe a case of an epicardial CIRC tumor that was resected and subsequently recurred in the left pulmonary hilum. This recurrence was treated with immunotherapy followed by radiotherapy. A 71-year-old man with a history of colon cancer incidentally had a mass bordering the epicardium on a postoperative follow-up computed tomography scan. Pericardial tumor resection was performed due to suspected metastasis from colon cancer. Histopathologically, the patient was diagnosed as a CIRC tumor (programmed death ligand 1 expression rate > 95%). Seven months after pericardial surgery, the patient was treated with nivolumab because of local recurrence in the left pulmonary hilum, but the tumor size gradually increased. Three months after the initiation of nivolumab, the patient had a completely atelectatic left lung due to tumor invasion into the left main bronchus and was treated with external beam radiotherapy of 66 Gy in 33 fractions. One and a half months after the completion of radiotherapy, the atelectasis disappeared, and aeration was greatly improved. Three months after the completion of radiotherapy, atelectasis and pericardial effusion appeared owing to tumor regrowth, and the patient died of heart failure 2 months later. This report provides insights into the efficacy of immunotherapy and radiotherapy for CIRC tumor.",1
"Metabolic adaptation serves as a significant driving force for cancer growth and poses a substantial obstacle for cancer therapies. Herein, we unraveled the role of m6A-mediated serine synthesis pathway (SSP) regulation in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrated that treatment of highly specific m6A inhibitor (STM2457) effectively inhibited HCC cell line growth and suppressed spontaneous HCC formation in mice driven by liver-specific Tp53 knockout and Myc overexpression. Using GLORI-seq, we delineated a single-base-resolution m6A landscape in human HCC cell lines. Interestingly, we identified three core enzymes in the SSP (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) as novel targets of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In these SSP genes, m6A modification recruited m6A reader IGF2BP3 to stabilize their mRNA transcripts, thereby enhancing their mRNA and protein expression in HCC cells. Most importantly, our GLORI-seq data revealed that sorafenib-resistant HCC cells elevated m6A modification in SSP genes to promote protein expression and antioxidant production. STM2457 treatment attenuated the serine synthesis pathway, induced oxidative stress, and sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib treatments. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting m6A could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","ABSTRACTAkkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is a ‘star strain’ that has attracted much attention in recent years. A. muciniphila can effectively regulate host metabolism, significantly affect host immune function, and play an important role in balancing host health and disease. As one of the organs most closely related to the gut (the two can communicate through the hepatic portal vein and bile duct system), liver is widely affected by intestinal microorganisms. A growing body of evidence suggests that A. muciniphila may alleviate liver-related diseases by improving the intestinal barrier, energy metabolism and regulating inflammation through its protein components and metabolites. This paper systematically reviews the key roles of A. muciniphila and its derivatives in maintaining liver health and improving liver disease.",1
"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for adrenal gland metastasis, with a focus on the assessment of the irradiated subjects’ endocrinological function.Materials and methodsA total of 36 patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2020 in this prospective phase II trial. Patients were treated with Linac-based SBRT, with a dose of 45 Gy in 3 consecutive fractions. Primary end-point was local control (LC) of the treated lesions and secondary end-points included evaluation of acute and late toxicity, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and the impact on the hormonal production of adrenal glands.ResultsWith a median follow-up of 9.5 months, LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 94.7% and 88.4%, respectively. Rates of PFS at 1 and 2 years were 50.5% and 29.8%, with a median PFS of 14.7 months. Rates of OS at 1 and 2 years were 62.9% and 44.1%. At univariate analysis, oligorecurrence was associated with better OS compared to oligoprogressive or synchronous metastatic disease. No grade 3 or greater toxicities were registered and only a minority of patients (22.2%) reported mild treatment-related side effects. Hormonal and electrolytes production was assessed before and after treatment, showing only a slight and transient variation within the reference ranges.ConclusionSBRT on adrenal metastases has been confirmed to be a feasible and effective treatment. With an excellent disease control and the preservation of the endocrine function, SBRT with ablative dose can be considered a viable alternative to more invasive approaches.","ObjectivePrimary intracranial histiocytic sarcomas (PIHSs) are extremely rare with limited reported cases, making their prognostic factors and management uncertain. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of PIHSs and propose a treatment protocol for this entity.MethodsClinical data were collected from six patients diagnosed with PIHSs at Beijing Tiantan Hospital between March 2011 and October 2022. Additionally, a comprehensive search of the PubMed database was conducted using the keywords ""primary intracranial"" or ""primary central nervous system"" combined with ""histiocytic sarcoma"" or ""histiocytic sarcomas"" between 1996 and 2022, identifying 24 cases. A pooled analysis of individual patient data was performed to assess risk factors for overall survival (OS).ResultsThe six cases included four males and two females, with a mean age of 42.2 ± 13.3 years. In total, 24 cases of PIHSs were identified from previous studies. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that gross total resection (GTR) was the only factor predicting a longer OS (p = 0.027). Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that GTR (p = 0.0013), solitary lesions (p = 0.0048), and radiotherapy (p = 0.0492) were associated with a longer OS.ConclusionPIHSs are rare brain tumors with poor clinical prognosis. Patients with solitary lesions have a longer OS than those with multifocal lesions. Gross total resection must be the first choice. Radiotherapy may bring benefits for these patients, but chemotherapy may not be useful. Further studies involving larger cohorts are necessary to validate these findings.",1
"IntroductionProteomics technology platforms offer an extremely useful tool for the discovery of new cancer biomarkers. Secreted proteins play important roles in signal transduction, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the molecular signatures of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by quantitative proteomics using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).Material and methodsIn this study, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to analyse the secretome of HCC tissues to identify plasma biomarkers. Serum-free conditioned media (CM) were collected from the primary cultures of cancerous tissues, the surrounding noncancerous tissues, and distal noncancerous tissues.ResultsA proteomic analysis of the CM proteins allowed for a total of 5214 identified proteins, of which 190 and 44 proteins were dysregulated in the HCC tissues/distal noncancerous tissues (HCC/DN group) and the adjacent noncancerous tissues/distal noncancerous tissues (AN/DN group) compared with the distal noncancerous tissues. The dysregulated proteins in the HCC/DN group were concentrated in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling, but the dysregulated proteins in the AN/DN group were more concentrated in the basal material metabolism.ConclusionsThe secretome profile alternations and signalling pathways were associated with HCC incidence and development. The dysregulated proteins in the HCC/DN group were concentrated in the MAPK signalling and JAK-STAT signalling, but the dysregulated proteins in the AN/DN group were more concentrated in the basal material metabolism.","Morreton virus (MORV) is a novel oncolytic Vesiculovirus, genetically distinct from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Herein we report that MORV induced potent cytopathic effects in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro models. In preliminary safety analyses, high intranasal doses (up to 1010 TCID50 ) of MORV were not associated with significant adverse effects in immune competent, non-tumor bearing mice. MORV was shown to be efficacious in a Hep3B hepatocellular cancer xenograft model, but not in a cholangiocarcinoma xenograft HuCCT1 model. In an immune competent, syngeneic murine cholangiocarcinoma model single intra-tumoral treatments with MORV (1 × 107 TCID50) triggered a robust antitumor immune response leading to substantial tumor regression and disease control at a dose 10-fold lower compared to VSV (1 × 108 TCID50). MORV led to increased CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, without compensatory increases in tumor associated macrophages, granulocytic or monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells. Our findings indicate that wild-type MORV is safe and can induce potent tumor regression via immune-mediated and immune-independent mechanisms in HCC and CCA animal models, without dose limiting adverse events. These data warrant further development and clinical translation of MORV as a novel oncolytic virotherapy platform.",1
"IntroductionThe regulatory role of miR-182 in breast cancer malignancy and macrophage reprogramming is well established. However, the mechanisms through which miR-182 overexpression in tumor cells influences macrophage polarization remain elusive.Material and methodsAfter transfection with miR-182-5p mimics, inhibitors, and controls for 24 h, exosomes were extracted by differential centrifugation from transfected MDA-MB-231. Macrophages were co-cultured with these exosomes to illustrate the regulative effects of exo-miR-182-5p reprogram macrophage. Furthermore, breast cancer cells were co-cultured with exo-miR-182-5p reprogrammed M2 macrophages to demonstrate the effects of reprogrammed M2 macrophages to influence breast cancer progression. After all, these findings were validated in a cell-derived xenograft (CDX) BALB/C nude-mouse model.ResultsThis study demonstrated that exosome-derived miR-182-5p from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells reprograms M2 macrophage polarization through direct combination with Notch1, thereby enhancing breast cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. When co-cultured with exosomes from TNBC cells transfected with miR-182-5p mimics or inhibitors, macrophages showed altered Notch1/Hes1 pathway expression, leading to M2 polarization and subsequent changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation, and other biochemical markers. Furthermore, breast cancer cells co-cultured with exosome-reprogrammed macrophages exhibited increased colony formation, migration, and invasion, as well as reduced apoptosis. These findings were validated in a BALB/C nude-mouse model.ConclusionsThis study pioneers the elucidation of the feedback loop mechanism between breast cancer cells and macrophages mediated by the exosome-derived miR-182-5p/Notch1 pathway, highlighting its role in macrophage reprogramming. Although the therapeutic application of miR-182-5p inhibitors as anticancer agents remains in the early stages, targeting macrophage polarization represents a promising avenue for breast cancer therapy.","BACKGROUND:Differentiating brain metastasis progression from radiation effects or radiation necrosis (RN) remains challenging. Golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI provides high spatial and temporal resolution to analyze tissue enhancement, which may differ between tumor progression (TP) and RN.OBJECTIVE:To investigate the utility of longitudinal GRASP MRI in distinguishing TP from RN after gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS:We retrospectively evaluated 48 patients with brain metastasis managed with SRS at our institution from 2013 to 2020 who had GRASP MRI before and at least once after SRS. TP (n = 16) was pathologically confirmed. RN (n = 16) was diagnosed on either resected tissue without evidence of tumor or on lesion resolution on follow-up. As a reference, we included a separate group of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer that showed favorable response with tumor control and without RN on subsequent imaging (n = 16). Mean contrast washin and washout slopes normalized to the superior sagittal sinus were compared between groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine diagnostic performance.RESULTS:After SRS, progression showed a significantly steeper washin slope than RN on all 3 follow-up scans (scan 1: 0.29 ± 0.16 vs 0.18 ± 0.08, P = .021; scan 2: 0.35 ± 0.19 vs 0.18 ± 0.09, P = .004; scan 3: 0.32 ± 0.12 vs 0.17 ± 0.07, P = .002). No significant differences were found in the post-SRS washout slope. Post-SRS washin slope differentiated progression and RN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74, a sensitivity of 75%, and a specificity of 69% on scan 1; an AUC of 0.85, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 69% on scan 2; and an AUC of 0.87, a sensitivity of 63%, and a specificity of 100% on scan 3.CONCLUSION:Longitudinal GRASP MRI may help to differentiate metastasis progression from RN.",0
"One in six deaths worldwide is caused by cancer, making it a major global health concern. Despite their effectiveness, traditional treatment approaches such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery frequently have negative side effects and high costs. New approaches, such as gene therapy, are promising but are hampered by high costs and accessibility problems. Nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate targeted drug delivery by leveraging passive targeting mechanisms, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and by actively targeting surfaces with ligands for site-specific binding through the functionalization of surfaces. This approach enhances therapeutic results while lowering off-target toxicities. Notably, chemotherapeutic medications, immunotherapeutic agents, and photothermal therapies can now be delivered more precisely to the affected site using NP-based systems. By boosting particularity, reducing side effects, and tackling drug resistance, nanomedicine has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and ultimately advance personalized oncological care. These advancements highlight the possibilities for field growth, and future development regulations are detailed.","Natural killer cells are critical players in the antitumor immune response due to their ability to destroy target cells through cytotoxic activity and other means. However, this response is inhibited in the tumor microenvironment, where a crippling hypoxic environment and several inhibitory molecules bind to NK cells to trigger an anergic state. Inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, NK2GA, KIR, TIGIT, and LAG-3 have been associated with inhibition of NK cells in multiple cancer types. Binding to these receptors leads to loss of cytotoxicity, lower proliferation and metabolic rates, and even apoptosis. While these receptors are important for avoiding auto-immunity, in a pathological setting like malignant neoplasms they are disadvantageous for the individual’s immune system to combat cancer cells. The use of monoclonal antibodies to block these receptors contributes to cancer therapy by preventing the inhibition of NK cells. In this review, the impact of NK cell inhibition and activation on cancer therapy was summarized and an overview of the blockade of inhibitory pathways by monoclonal antibodies was provided.",1
"Cellular heterogeneity is a ubiquitous aspect of biology and a major obstacle to successful cancer treatment. Several techniques have emerged to quantify heterogeneity in live cells along axes including cellular migration, morphology, growth, and signaling. Crucially, these studies reveal that cellular heterogeneity is not a result of randomness or a failure in cellular control systems, but instead is a predictable aspect of multicellular systems. We hypothesize that individual cells in complex tissues can behave as reward-maximizing agents and that differences in reward perception can explain heterogeneity. In this perspective, we introduce inverse reinforcement learning as a novel approach for analyzing cellular heterogeneity. We briefly detail experimental approaches for measuring cellular heterogeneity over time and how these experiments can generate datasets consisting of cellular states and actions. Next, we show how inverse reinforcement learning can be applied to these datasets to infer how individual cells choose different actions based on heterogeneous states. Finally, we introduce potential applications of inverse reinforcement learning to three cell biology problems. Overall, we expect inverse reinforcement learning to reveal why cells behave heterogeneously and enable identification of novel treatments based on this new understanding.","Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine whether MRI radiomic features of key cerebral structures differ between women and men, and whether detection of such differences depends on the image resolution.Materials and Methods:Ultrahigh resolution (UHR) 3D MP2RAGE (magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo) T1-weighted MR images (voxel size, 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm3) of the brain of 30 subjects (18 women and 12 men; mean age, 39.0 ± 14.8 years) without abnormal findings on MRI were retrospectively included. MRI was performed on a whole-body 7 T MR system. A convolutional neural network was used to segment the following structures: frontal cortex, frontal white matter, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and corpus callosum. Eighty-seven radiomic features were extracted respectively: gray-level histogram (n = 18), co-occurrence matrix (n = 24), run-length matrix (n = 16), size-zone matrix (n = 16), and dependence matrix (n = 13). Feature extraction was performed at UHR and, additionally, also after resampling to 1.4 × 1.4 × 1.4 mm3 voxel size (standard clinical resolution). Principal components (PCs) of radiomic features were calculated, and independent samples t tests with Cohen d as effect size measure were used to assess differences in PCs between women and men for the different cerebral structures.Results:At UHR, at least a single PC differed significantly between women and men in 6/7 cerebral structures: frontal cortex (d = −0.79, P = 0.042 and d = −1.01, P = 0.010), frontal white matter (d = −0.81, P = 0.039), thalamus (d = 1.43, P < 0.001), globus pallidus (d = 0.92, P = 0.020), caudate nucleus (d = −0.83, P = 0.039), and corpus callosum (d = −0.97, P = 0.039). At standard clinical resolution, only a single PC extracted from the corpus callosum differed between sexes (d = 1.05, P = 0.009).Conclusions:Nonnegligible differences in radiomic features of several key structures of the brain exist between women and men, and need to be accounted for. Very high spatial resolution may be required to uncover and further investigate the sexual dimorphism of brain structures on MRI.",1
"BackgroundCheckpoint inhibitors (CKI) targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 are major therapies for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite numerous studies of biological biomarkers, we currently lack a marker to predict CKI primary resistance. The aim of this study was to isolate clinical markers associated with the absence of efficacy of CKI used as monotherapy in NSCLC.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 172 patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for advanced NSCLC at the Dijon Cancer Center. Baseline characteristics were compared using the Chi squared test between responders and non-responders. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test for univariate analysis. Cox regression models were used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).ResultsAmong 172 patients included, 149 (86.5%) received CKI after platinum chemotherapy. Response rate (RR) was 16%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 months (95% CI 0.7–30 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95% CI 0.7–46.8 months). By univariate analysis, WHO performance status ≥ 1, presence of bone, liver and pleuroperitoneal metastasis were associated with poor PFS and OS. Multivariate analysis showed that only pleuroperitoneal metastasis was independently associated with PFS and OS. Patients with pleuroperitoneal metastasis and WHO performance status ≥ 1 had a < 10% chance of yielding a benefit from CKI.ConclusionsOur data support the hypothesis that pleuroperitoneal metastasis is a major predictive factor affecting CKI efficacy in NSCLC patients and may be used to avoid CKI monotherapy for such patients.","PurposeThis prospective study evaluated whether peripheral blood biomarkers and metabolic parameters on F-18 fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) could be associated with clinical outcome in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).MethodsData from 33 patients with NSCLC and treated with ICI were collected. Complete blood cell counts before and at the first restaging were measured. All patients underwent F-18 FDG PET/CT at baseline, while 25 patients at the first restaging. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined and compared using the Kaplan–Meier and the log-rank test. The median follow-up was 11.3 months (range 1–17 months).ResultsMultivariate analyses demonstrated that low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR < 4.9) and low total lesion glycolysis (TLG < 541.5 ml) at the first restaging were significantly associated with PFS (both p = 0.019) and OS (p = 0.001 and p = 0.048, respectively). An immune-metabolic-prognostic index (IMPI), based on post-NLR and post-TLG was developed, categorizing 3 groups: high risk, 2 factors; intermediate risk, 1 factor; low risk, 0 factors. Median PFS for low, intermediate and high risk was 7.8 months (95% CI 4.6–11.0), 5.6 months (95% CI 3.8–7.4), and 1.8 months (95% CI 1.6–2.0) (p < 0.001) respectively. Likewise, median OS was 15.2 months (95% CI 10.9–19.6), 13.2 months (95% CI 5.9–20.3), and 2.8 months (95% CI 1.4–4.2) (p < 0.001), respectively.ConclusionIMPI at the first restaging, combining both inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, was correlated with PFS and OS. IMPI can be a potentially valuable tool for identifying NSCLC patients who are likely to benefit from ICI.",1

Few strategies can effectively prevent the occurrence of HCC. Although immunotherapy has significantly improved HCC-related survival in recent years, this systemic therapy is very expensive and lays a heavy burden on most HCC patients. Aspirin, which is currently one of the most widely used medications in analgesic and cardiovascular diseases, is reported to have anti-tumor effects on HCC. Most importantly, long-term administration of low-dose aspirin does not significantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Owing to its cost-effectiveness and wide use, aspirin can be easily applied as an HCC treatment and is affordable for a wide range of patients. Therefore, deeper understanding and more attention are needed to extend the frontline of aspirin's preventive and therapeutic potential into cancer research and management. In this review, we discuss the preventive effect of aspirin on HCC in the context of different etiological factors, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcohol-associated liver disease. The therapeutic role of aspirin in resectable or unresectable HCC management is also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of aspirin on HCC are fully reviewed and discussed in the following two aspects: the effect of aspirin on multi-oncogenic signaling pathways in HCC (for example, AMPK, Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB) and aspirin-mediated immunometabolic responses in liver diseases. These findings indicate aspirin is a promising agent for populations at risk and HCC patients to prevent or treat HCC.",0
"Introduction:In 2018, durvalumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as consolidation immunotherapy for patients with stage III NSCLC after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, whether durvalumab benefits patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC remains unknown.Methods:We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC who completed concurrent CRT. Kaplan-Meier analyses evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who completed CRT with or without durvalumab.Results:Among 37 patients, 13 initiated durvalumab a median of 20 days after CRT completion. Two patients completed 12 months of treatment, with five patients discontinuing durvalumab owing to progression and five owing to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Of 24 patients who completed CRT without durvalumab, 16 completed CRT alone and eight completed CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Median PFS was 10.3 months in patients who received CRT and durvalumab versus 6.9 months with CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.993). CRT and EGFR TKI was associated with a significantly longer median PFS (26.1 mo) compared with CRT and durvalumab or CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.023). Six patients treated with durvalumab initiated EGFR TKIs after recurrence, with one developing grade 4 pneumonitis on osimertinib.Conclusions:In this study, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC did not benefit with consolidation durvalumab and experienced a high frequency of irAEs. Patients who initiate osimertinib after durvalumab may be susceptible to incident irAEs. Consolidation durvalumab should be approached with caution in this setting and concurrent CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR TKIs further investigated as definitive treatment.","AbstractBackground:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subsequent radiotherapy (RT) following first-line treatment with durvalumab plus chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).Methods:A total of 122 patients with ES-SCLC from three hospitals during July 2019 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was performed to address potential confounding factors. The primary focus of our evaluation was to assess the impact of RT on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:After IPTW analysis, 49 patients received durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide (EP) chemotherapy followed by RT (Durva + EP + RT) and 72 patients received immunochemotherapy (Durva + EP). The median OS was 17.2 months vs. 12.3 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17–0.85, P = 0.020), and the median PFS was 8.9 months vs. 5.9 months (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32–0.97, P = 0.030) in Durva + EP + RT and Durva + EP groups, respectively. Thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) resulted in longer OS (17.2 months vs. 14.7 months) and PFS (9.1 months vs. 7.2 months) compared to RT directed to other metastatic sites. Among patients with oligo-metastasis, RT also showed significant benefits, with a median OS of 17.4 months vs. 13.7 months and median PFS of 9.8 months vs. 5.9 months compared to no RT. Continuous durvalumab treatment beyond progression (TBP) prolonged OS compared to patients without TBP, in both the Durva + EP + RT (NA vs. 15.8 months, HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.14–1.63, P = 0.238) and Durva + EP groups (12.3 months vs. 4.3 months, HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10–0.81, P = 0.018). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 13 (26.5%) and 13 (18.1%) patients, respectively, in the two groups; pneumonitis was mostly low-grade.Conclusion:Addition of RT after first-line immunochemotherapy significantly improved survival outcomes with manageable toxicity in ES-SCLC.",1
"PurposeThe crucial role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy has been broadly depicted. However, the molecular phenotypic linkages between m6A modification pattern and immunological ecosystem are expected to be disentangled in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for immunotherapeutic unresponsiveness circumvention and combination with promising drug agents.MethodsModification patterns of m6A methylation were qualitatively dissected according to the large-scale HCC samples profiling. We then determined the immune phenotypic linkages by systematically evaluating their tumor microenvironment composition, immune/stromal-relevant signature, immune checkpoints correlation, and prognostic value. Individual quantification of m6A methylation pattern was achieved by m6Ascore construction, intensified by longitudinal single-cell analysis of immunotherapy cohort and validated by the transcriptomic profiles of our in-hospital GDPH-HCC cohort. Candidate therapeutic agents were also screened out.ResultsThree distinct m6A methylation patterns were determined in high accordance with inflamed-, excluded-, and desert-immunophenotype. To be precise, Immune-inflamed high-m6Ascore group was characterized by activated immunity with favorable prognosis. Stromal activation and absence of immune cell infiltration were observed in low-m6Ascore phenotype, linked to impaired outcome. Patients with low-m6Ascore demonstrated diminished responses and clinical benefits for cohorts receiving immunotherapy. The above credible linkage between m6A methylation pattern and tumor immune microenvironment was robustly validated in our GDPH-HCC cohort. Single-cell dynamic change of m6A methylation level in exhausted CD8 T cell and fibroblast was depicted in immunotherapy cohort fore and art. Derived from m6A methylation pattern, seven potential frontline drug agents were recognized as promising choice for high-m6Ascore patients.ConclusionOur work bridged the credible linkage between epigenetics and anti-tumor immunity in HCC, unraveling m6A modification pattern as immunological indicator and predictor for immunotherapy. Individualized m6Ascore facilitated strategic choices to maximize therapy-responsive possibility.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04589-2.","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification. M6A RNA methylation is reversible: m6A is installed by “writers”, removed by “erasers”, and recognized by “readers”. Readers are executors to regulate RNA metabolism by recognizing specific m6A sites, including RNA splicing, export, translation and decay. YTHDF2 is the first identified m6A reader protein. YTHDF2 interacts with m6A-containing transcripts to accelerate the degradation process and regulate various biological processes, such as viral infection, stem cell development and cancer progression. Although there are some reviews about m6A modification in physiological and pathological processes, few reviews focus on roles of YTHDF2 in cancers to date. Therefore, in this review, we attempted to systematically summarize m6A reader protein YTHDF2: its structure, mechanisms in regulating RNA metabolism, roles in cancer progression and potential application for cancer treatment, which might inspire new ideas for m6A research in cancers and provide novel insights into cancer treatment.",1
"Although autophagy sequesters intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in in vitro cultured macrophages, loss of autophagy in macrophages in vivo does not result in susceptibility to a standard low-dose Mtb infection until late during infection, leaving open questions regarding the protective role of autophagy during Mtb infection. We report herein that loss of autophagy in lung macrophages and dendritic cells results in acute susceptibility of mice to high-dose Mtb infection, a model better mimicking active tuberculosis. However, rather than observing a role for autophagy in controlling Mtb replication in macrophages, we find that autophagy suppresses macrophage responses to Mtb infection that otherwise result in the accumulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells and subsequent defects in T cell responses. Our finding that the pathogen-plus-susceptibility gene interaction is dependent on dose has important implications on understanding how Mtb infections in humans lead to a spectrum of outcomes and the potential use of autophagy modulators in clinical medicine.","AbstractBACKGROUNDIntracranial epidermoid cysts (EC) account for approximately 0.2%-1.8% of all intracranial tumors. Extremely rare, these benign lesions may undergo malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The time frame for transformation can vary greatly, and the ideal management approach remains uncertain. MATERIAL AND METHODS55-year-old female patient with history of migraines was diagnosed with an incidental cystic lesion suggestive of EC in right cerebellopontine angle (CPA) since the age of 30. She experienced a sudden onset in March 2023 of auditory decline in her right ear, tinnitus, vertigo, headache, dysgeusia, and gait disturbance. Examination revealed involvement of the VIII right cranial nerve with sensorineural hearing loss and complete right facial nerve palsy. She underwent surgery in June 2023 where the cyst was resected however, the capsule of the tumor was strongly adhered to the brainstem, unable to be removed. It showed positive immunohistochemistry for p63, p40, CK5/6, CK7, D2-40, S100, PD-L1, Ki67 was positive in 20% of neoplastic cells, brachyury was negative, consistent with EC with malignant transformation to SCC. She developed few days after the surgery, dysarthria, diplopia, IV and VI right nerve palsies and right dysmetria. Neuroaxis contrast-enhanced MRI was performed with no evidence of lesion otherwise. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials, blink reflex test and facial nerve conduction tests were completed and abnormal due to axonal right facial nerve neuropathy with side-to-side ≥ 90% difference and profound right hearing loss.RESULTSThe one-month follow-up brain MRI showed the right CPA lesion with heterogeneous enhancement with increase in diameter and involvement of the auditory canal. 18FDG) PET/CT demonstrated focal hypermetabolism (SUVmax 10.3) in the right CPA indicative of progression. She underwent radiosurgery with a total dose of 30 Gy in 5 sessions (October 2023). The follow-up 18FDG PET/CT (April 19, 2024) showed no distant sites associated with abnormal hypermetabolism but persistent focal hypermetabolism that decreased compared to previous exam (SUVmax 7.2). The patient is currently 11 months apart from her diagnosis without new neurological findings. Chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors have not been used yet. CONCLUSIONWe report a case of intracranial SCC derived from an EC, the occurrence this malignant transformation is uncommon and typically indicates a poor prognosis. Small series and case reports are to date available in the literature. After surgery, radiotherapy or radiosurgery should be considered, close follow-up is recommended, chemotherapy or immunotherapy can be used but its effectiveness remains unclear.",0
"This letter considers the possibility of using the optical trap to study the structure and function of the microbial flagellum. The structure of the flagellum of a typical gram-negative bacterium is described in brief. A standard mathematical model based on the principle of superposition is used to describe the movement of an ellipsoidal microbial cell in a liquid medium. The basic principles of optical trapping based on the combined action of the light pressure and the gradient force are briefly clarified. Several problems related to thermal damage of living microscopic objects when the latter gets to the focus of a laser beam are shortly discussed. It is shown that the probability of cell damage depends nonlinearly on the wavelength of laser radiation. Finally, the model systems that would make it possible to study flagella of the free bacteria and the ones anchored or tethered on the surface of a solid material are discussed in detail.","This review article explores the potential of engineering antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for the immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases.

"Respiratory tract infections represent a significant global public health concern, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. RNA viruses, particularly influenza viruses and coronaviruses, significantly contribute to respiratory illnesses, especially in immunosuppressed and elderly individuals. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to pose global health threats due to their capacity to cause annual epidemics, with profound implications for public health. In addition, the increase in global life expectancy is influencing the dynamics and outcomes of respiratory viral infections. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which IAVs and SARS-CoV-2 contribute to lung disease progression is therefore crucial. The aim of this review is to comprehensively explore the impact of IAVs and SARS-CoV-2 on chronic lung diseases, with a specific focus on pulmonary fibrosis in the elderly. It also outlines potential preventive and therapeutic strategies and suggests directions for future research.","ObjectiveTo systematically review the most recent scientific literature regarding modern strategies for organ preservation in the treatment of non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer.MethodsLiterature search was made using PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Wiley Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival rate, which was addressed by a systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.ResultsThe evidence is consistent in showing that 5-year survival of trimodality therapy is similar to radical cystectomy in selected patients, ranging between 29% and 73%. Patients undergoing bladder-sparing therapy were found to have better outcomes in terms of quality of life and sociability than those undergoing radical cystectomy. Immunotherapy is establishing itself as a strategy for organ-preservation treatment, showing complete response rates between 42% and 100%. However, most of these results have been obtained from ongoing clinical trials. Furthermore, there are still no studies comparing the efficacy among the different available therapies.ConclusionAlthough radical cystectomy remains the gold standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, its significant morbidity has prompted the exploration of alternative therapies. In this context, bladder preservation therapies, though supported by limited literature, emerge as a potential alternative that could offer comparable oncological outcomes in selected patients.",0
"PurposeDrug resistance inevitably occurs despite the encouraging results of immunotherapy. This study attempted to investigate immunotherapy rechallenge treatment regimens and factors associated with outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) according to resistance status.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted on patients with advanced NSCLC who received immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy and immune rechallenge between March 2016 and December 2022. Primary resistance (RR) was defined by an absence of response after treatment administered for less than 6 months before progression. Acquired resistance (AR) was defined as a response to immunotherapy treatment administered for more than 6 months before progression. Disease progression in as many as three lesions was defined as systemic progression, whereas disease progression in fewer than three lesions was defined as oligo-progression.ResultsOf 40 patients, 18 (45%) had primary resistance, and 22 (55%) developed AR. Overall survival (OS) was not reached. A significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was observed in individuals rechallenged with ICIs after AR and RR (7.0 months vs. 2.1 months, P = 0.003). Patients receiving interval treatment before rechallenge achieved longer PFS than those who did not (6.2 months vs. 4.0 months, P = 0.027). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that systemic progression was a risk factor significantly associated with PFS after ICI rechallenge (P = 0.006). After AR, ICI rechallenge prolonged the duration of PFS if patients developed oligo-progression (5.4 months vs. 1.1 months, P < 0.001).ConclusionICI rechallenge is likely to be an option for patients with oligo-progression during rechallenge, particularly after AR.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05490-8.","We present an unusual case of uveitis secondary to avelumab and pembrolizumab in a 39-year-old Taiwanese male with stage IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and lung metastasis, who initially received pembrolizumab as his primary treatment. However, the patient experienced skin and liver immune-related adverse events (irAEs) after the seventh dose of pembrolizumab, which prompted a switch to avelumab. The patient began to experience gradual blurring of vision after completing the fifth cycle of avelumab immunotherapy. Ophthalmic examinations revealed findings consistent with bilateral anterior uveitis. Despite an initial lack of significant improvement with steroid treatment, the patient’s vision and inflammation improved upon discontinuation of avelumab. Due to the occurrence of uveitis, avelumab was switched back to pembrolizumab. However, three months after initiating pembrolizumab, the patient developed foggy vision and bilateral anterior uveitis with cystoid macular edema (CME). The administration of topical, oral, and subconjunctival steroids resulted in an improvement in vision and the resolution of CME, without the need to discontinue pembrolizumab. Over the subsequent eighteen months, there has been no recurrence of uveitis, and there is no evidence of relapse or further metastasis in his ccRCC.",0
"Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat in the medical field. Machine learning (ML) has enabled in-depth analysis of complex patterns from large, diverse datasets, greatly facilitating “healthcare automation” in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Despite these advancements, ML models face challenges stemming from limited labeled sample sizes, the intricate interplay of high-dimensionality data types, the inherent heterogeneity observed among patients and within tumors, and concerns about interpretability and consistency with existing biomedical knowledge. One approach to address these challenges is to integrate biomedical knowledge into data-driven models, which has proven potential to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of model results. Here, we review the state-of-the-art ML studies that leverage the fusion of biomedical knowledge and data, termed knowledge-informed machine learning (KIML), to advance cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We provide an overview of diverse forms of knowledge representation and current strategies of knowledge integration into machine learning pipelines with concrete examples. We conclude the review article by discussing future directions aimed at leveraging KIML to advance cancer research and healthcare automation. A live summary of the review is hosted at  offering an evolving resource to support research in this field.","PurposeEwing sarcoma (ES) is one of the most common malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents. The immune microenvironment plays an important role in the development of ES. Here, we developed an optimal signature for determining ES patient prognosis based on immune-related genes (IRGs).MethodsWe analyzed the ES gene expression profile dataset, GSE17679, from the GEO database and extracted differential expressed IRGs (DEIRGs). Then, we conducted functional correlation and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses of the DEIRGs and used the machine learning algorithm-iterative Lasso Cox regression analysis to build an optimal DEIRG signature. In addition, we applied ES samples from the ICGC database to test the optimal gene signature. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regressions on clinicopathological characteristics and optimal gene signature to evaluate whether signature is an important prognostic factor. Finally, we calculated the infiltration of 24 immune cells in ES using the ssGSEA algorithm, and analyzed the correlation between the DEIRGs in the optimal gene signature and immune cells.ResultsA total of 249 DEIRGs were screened and an 11-gene signature with the strongest correlation with patient prognoses was analyzed using a machine learning algorithm. The 11-gene signature also had a high prognostic value in the ES external verification set. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that 11-gene signature is an independent prognostic factor. We found that macrophages and cytotoxic, CD8 T, NK, mast, B, NK CD56bright, TEM, TCM, and Th2 cells were significantly related to patient prognoses; the infiltration of cytotoxic and CD8 T cells in ES was significantly different. By correlating prognostic biomarkers with immune cell infiltration, we found that FABP4 and macrophages, and NDRG1 and Th2 cells had the strongest correlation.ConclusionOverall, the IRG-related 11-gene signature can be used as a reliable ES prognostic biomarker and can provide guidance for personalized ES therapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03396-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"Pancreatic cancer is a significant public health concern, with increasing incidence rates and limited treatment options. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, in the development and progression of this disease. Microbial dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota, has been implicated in pancreatic carcinogenesis through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances. Researchers have identified specific microbial signatures associated with pancreatic cancer, offering potential biomarkers for early detection and prognostication. By leveraging advanced sequencing and bioinformatics tools, scientists have delineated differences in the gut microbiota between pancreatic cancer patients and healthy individuals, providing insights into disease pathogenesis and potential diagnostic strategies. Moreover, the microbiome holds promise as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer treatment. Interventions aimed at modulating the microbiome, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have demonstrated potential in enhancing the efficacy of existing cancer therapies, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These approaches can influence immune responses, alter tumor microenvironments, and sensitize tumors to treatment, offering new avenues for improving patient outcomes and overcoming therapeutic resistance. Overall, understanding the complex interplay between the microbiome and pancreatic cancer is crucial for advancing our knowledge of disease mechanisms and identifying innovative therapeutic strategies. Here we report phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA microbial sequences of the pancreatic cancer mice microbiome and corresponding age matched healthy mice microbiome. We successfully identified differentially abundant microbiota in pancreatic cancer.","AbstractBackgroundAcquired resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy due to DNA mismatch repair (MMR) enzyme deficiency is a barrier to improving outcomes for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) patients. KL-50 is a new imidazotetrazine-based therapeutic designed to induce DNA interstrand cross-links, and subsequent double-stranded breaks, in an MMR-independent manner in cells with O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) deficiency. Previous research showed its efficacy against LN229 glioma cells with MMR and MGMT knockdown. Its activity against patient-derived GBM that model post-TMZ recurrent tumors is unclear.MethodsWe created MMR-deficient GBM patient-derived xenografts through exposure to TMZ, followed by treatment with additional TMZ or KL-50. We also generated isogenic, MSH6 knockout (KO) patient-derived GBM and tested them for sensitivity to TMZ and KL-50.ResultsKL-50 extended the median survival of mice intracranially engrafted with either patient-derived TMZ-naïve GBM6 or TMZ-naïve GBM12 by 1.75-fold and 2.15-fold, respectively (P < 0.0001). A low dose (4 Gy) of fractionated RT further extended the survival of KL-50-treated GBM12 mice (median survival = 80 days for RT + KL-50 vs. 71 days KL-50 alone, P = 0.018). KL-50 also extended the median survival of mice engrafted with post-TMZ, MMR-deficient GBM6R-m185 (140 days for KL-50 vs. 37 days for vehicle, P < 0.0001). MSH6 KO increased TMZ IC50 for GBM6 and GBM12 cultures by >5-fold and >12-fold for cell death and live cell count outputs, respectively. In contrast, MSH6-KO actually decreased KL-50 IC50 by 10–80%.ConclusionKL-50-based compounds are a promising new strategy for the treatment of MGMT-deficient, MMR-deficient GBM that recurs after frontline TMZ.",0
"ABSTRACTAs COVID-19 is the third coronavirus epidemic in this century, it would be desirable to have a treatment scheme in anticipation of a fourth one. We here present a scheme that could clear SARS-CoV-2 in 2–4 days post-infection from the upper respiratory tract (URT), where the virions are initially concentrated. The scheme, applicable on a large scale by nasal spray, is based on homoharringtonine (HHT), which has been approved for treating other diseases. HHT blocked protein elongation and repressed in vitro replication of all four coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) that were tested at the nano-molar concentration, demonstrating its potential for broad effectiveness against coronaviruses. In animal models, HHT cleared SARS-CoV-2 in all treated mice within 3 days by daily nasal dripping of a small dose (40 μg). In December 2022, HHT was administered to 26 cancer patients by nebulization at 1 mg/day. On average, the viral load in the URT was reduced by three-quarters 6 hours after the nebulization. In the wavelet of May 2023, 11 patients without other medical conditions were administered HHT by repeated liquid nasal spray at the low total daily dose of 0.2 mg. Ten of the 11 patients were cleared of the virus in 2–4 days. In comparison, in large-cohort studies of participants in China during the same wave, most patients need 7–9 days to turn negative. No adverse effects were detected in any patient in the two clinical trials. A short review of drugs approved for treating COVID-19 shows the many advantages of HHT. With continual development, it could become a first-line defense at the onset of future coronavirus epidemics.","ABSTRACTObjective:The term post-COVID (coronavirus disease) is used to refer to the presence of prolonged symptoms 12 weeks or more after the disease treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of symptoms and anxiety in patients with COVID-19 who did not require inpatient care at the third and sixth months following symptom onset.Materials and Methods:The study is a prospective cohort study involving 471 university employees who contracted COVID-19 between October 2020 and October 2021. Data were obtained through the disease contact follow-up program implemented at the university and phone interviews conducted at the third and sixth months from symptom onset.Results:The study group comprised 361 individuals at three months and 109 at six months from symptom onset. The study found that symptoms persisted in 116 (32.1%) people in the third month and in 47 (13.0%) people in the sixth month. The most common symptoms at three months were shortness of breath, fatigue, and fatigue, while fatigue, fatigue, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms at six months.Conclusion:Understanding the long-term effects of coronavirus will enhance the management of the disease. As a result, the follow-up of symptomatic COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients will become more systematic and effective.",1
"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant disease in the world which has a profound effect on human health and life quality. According to tumor stage and pathological diagnosis, OSCC is mainly treated by combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, traditional treatment methods suffer from some limitations, such as systemic toxicity, limited therapeutic effect and drug resistance. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, nanodrug delivery systems (DDSs) and intelligent DDSs have been widely used in targeted therapy for OSCC. Meanwhile, the newly developed therapeutic techniques such as immunotherapy, gene therapy and bionic technology provide the possibility to realize the active targeted therapy. Here, the latest advances of target therapy for OSCC are reviewed, and their therapeutic remarks, current limits and future prospects are also systematically interpreted. It is believed that active and passive targeted therapies have great potentials for clinical transformation and application of OSCC, which will greatly improve human quality of life.","AbstractBackground:Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent type of cancer with a high mortality rate in its late stages. One of the major challenges in OSCC treatment is the resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanism underlying drug resistance and develop appropriate precision therapy strategies to enhance clinical efficacy.Methods:To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) inhibitor KN93 and EGFR inhibitors, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments using two FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1)-deficient (SCC9 and SCC25) and two FAT1 wild-type (SCC47 and HN12) OSCC cell lines. We assessed the effects of EGFR inhibitors (afatinib or cetuximab), KN93, or their combination on the malignant phenotype of OSCC in vivo and in vitro. The alterations in protein expression levels of members of the EGFR signaling pathway and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) were analyzed. Changes in the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) protein were characterized. Moreover, we analyzed mitochondrial dysfunction. Besides, the effects of combination therapy on mitochondrial dynamics were also evaluated.Results:OSCC with FAT1 mutations exhibited resistance to EGFR inhibitors treatment. The combination of KN93 and EGFR inhibitors significantly inhibited the proliferation, survival, and migration of FAT1-mutated OSCC cells and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, combination therapy enhanced the therapeutic sensitivity of FAT1-mutated OSCC cells to EGFR inhibitors by modulating the EGFR pathway and downregulated tumor stemness-related proteins. Furthermore, combination therapy induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, ultimately resulting in tumor suppression.Conclusion:Combination therapy with EGFR inhibitors and KN93 could be a novel precision therapeutic strategy and a potential clinical solution for EGFR-resistant OSCC patients with FAT1 mutations.",1
"PurposeIdentifying patients at high risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that impede the achievement of durable efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade therapy is important in improving their management. Identification of a novel predictive factor of therapeutic benefit is also important in improving patient selection for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Further determinants driving response and linking with irAEs are urgently required.MethodsTo address these unmet needs in the field, we explored whether 27 soluble checkpoint proteins and immunomodulatory proteins in serum at the therapy baseline and after week 3 were associated with irAE onset and therapeutic efficacy using MILLIPLEX Human Immuno-Oncology Checkpoint Protein Panel assays in a prospective, multicenter cohort of 81 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving atezolizumab monotherapy.ResultsBy competing-risks regression analysis, we identified that high levels of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) at baseline were a significant and strong risk factor of irAEs (hazard ratio, 5.61; 95% confidence interval, 2.43–12.96; P < 0.0001). We also identified that increased inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) during the first therapeutic cycle was an independent factor associated with prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival.ConclusionThese findings are in keeping with the reported mechanistic basis of these molecules and may provide potential guidance for clinical decision-making to improve patient care. Further validation studies are warranted.Trial registration UMIN000035616 (January 28, 2019)Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04193-w.","Purpose:Neoadjuvant anti-PD-(L)1 therapy improves the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in unselected triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Given the potential for long-term morbidity from immune-related adverse events (irAEs), optimizing the risk-benefit ratio for these agents in the curative neoadjuvant setting is important. Suboptimal clinical response to initial neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is associated with low rates of pCR (2–5%) and may define a patient selection strategy for neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade. We conducted a single-arm phase II study of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel as the second phase of NAT in patients with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)-resistant TNBC (NCT02530489).Methods:Patients with stage I-III, AC-resistant TNBC, defined as disease progression or a <80% reduction in tumor volume after 4 cycles of AC, were eligible. Patients received atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3weeks x4) and nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2 IV,Q1 week x12) as the second phase of NAT before undergoing surgery followed by adjuvant atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3 weeks, x4). A two-stage Gehan-type design was employed to detect an improvement in pCR/residual cancer burden class I (RCB-I) rate from 5% to 20%.Results:From 2/15/2016 through 1/29/2021, 37 patients with AC-resistant TNBC were enrolled. The pCR/RCB-I rate was 46%. No new safety signals were observed. Seven patients (19%) discontinued atezolizumab due to irAEs.Conclusion:This study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a promising signal of activity in this high-risk population (pCR/RCB-I=46% vs 5% in historical controls), suggesting that a response-adapted approach to the utilization of neoadjuvant immunotherapy should be considered for further evaluation in a randomized clinical trial.",1
"Background:In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) revolution is rapidly moving from metastatic to early-stage, however, the impact of clinicopathological variables and optimal treatment sequencing remain unclear.Methods:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with ICI as single agent or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (PCT) were included. Primary outcomes were pathological complete response (pCR), event free survival (EFS) (neoadjuvant/perioperative), and disease-free survival (DFS) (adjuvant). Secondary outcomes were major pathological response (MPR), overall survival (OS), toxicity, surgical outcomes (neoadjuvant/perioperative); OS and toxicity (adjuvant). An additional secondary endpoint was to compare EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative strategies.Results:8 RCTs (2 neoadjuvant, 4 perioperative, 2 adjuvant) (4661 participants) were included. Neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI+PCT significantly improved pCR, EFS, OS, MPR and R0 resection compared to PCT. Adjuvant ICI significantly improved DFS compared to placebo. There was a significant subgroup interaction by PD-L1 status (χ2 = 10.72, P = 0.005), pCR (χ2 = 17.80, P < 0.0001), and stage (χ2 = 4.46, P = 0.003) for EFS. No difference according to PD-L1 status was found for pCR, with 14% of patients having PD-L1 negative tumors still experiencing a pCR. No interaction by PD-L1 status was found for DFS upon adjuvant ICI. Indirect comparison showed no difference in EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative ICI+PCT.Conclusions:PD-L1 status, pCR and stage impact on survival upon neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI. The restriction of neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI to PD-L1 + patients could preclude pCR and long-term benefit in the PD-L1-subgroup. Neoadjuvant and perioperative could be equivalent strategies.","IntroductionWhile some clinical studies have shown that PD-1 and PD-L1 can also be an effective neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), no evidence has been available for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor sintilimab combined with chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment for potentially resectable NSCLC in the Chinese population.MethodsThis prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial (registration number: NCT04326153) included treatment-naive patients with potentially resectable NSCLC (stage IIIA/IIIB) who received sintilimab plus nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin for two to three cycles before systematic nodal dissection 30 to 45 days after neoadjuvant treatment. After surgery, patients needed to complete two cycles of adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (sintilimab + nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival rate at 24 months, whereas secondary endpoints included major pathological response (MPR) and pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, the proportion of patients who achieved tumor downstaging, overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), and adverse effects. PD-L1 status before and after treatment was also determined.ResultsAmong the 20 patients who received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, 16 underwent radical resection. The disease control rate and ORR were 90% and 70%, respectively. Among the 16 patients who underwent surgery, 10 (62.5%) and 5 (31.25%) achieved MPR and pCR, respectively. Squamous cell NSCLC exhibited superior response rates compared to adenocarcinoma (pCR 35.7% vs. 0%). Moreover, 14 patients (70%) experienced grade 1 or 2 neoadjuvant treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), whereas 6 (30%) experienced grade 3 TRAEs. Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) was found in the current study as an adverse reaction of concern. The rate of BPF was 20% (4/20), of which three patients were in grade 1–2, and one patient died. The occurrence of BPF had no significant correlation with basic disease history, nutritional status, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, surgical procedure, pathological remission, and PD-L1 expression. However, during neoadjuvant treatment, no adverse events prompted dose reduction, treatment discontinuation, surgery delay, or death. Although PD-L1 expression may change after chemoimmunotherapy, no regular pattern was noted. PD-L1 expression, neither at baseline nor after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, was associated with pathological remission.ConclusionsThe current study found similar ORR, slightly lower MPR and pCR rates, and lower grade 3 TRAEs among patients with potentially resectable stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC compared to the NADIM trial, as well as a greater ORR, MPR rate, pCR rate, and grade 3 TRAEs compared to Gao’s study involving sintilimab for Chinese patients with resectable stage IA–IIIB NSCLC. Though neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy had been found to promote a high risk of BPF for patients with stage IIIA/IIIB disease, it offered greater potential for radical cure. Therefore, the current study suggests that neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy can be a safe approach in increasing the efficiency of treatment and hopefully improving the prognosis of patients with potentially resectable locally advanced NSCLC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03896-w.",1
"ObjectiveGanoderic acid A can inhibit the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells. Surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of ganoderic acid A still remain poorly defined. Ganoderic acid A derivative (GaAD19) is an effective ingredient obtained by structural modification of ganoderic acid A. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-proliferation effect of GaAD19 on cervical cancer cells.MethodsThrough the HeLa cervical cancer cell model, the drug target of GaAD19 was predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database and molecular docking. Subsequently, computer analysis results were verified by a series of molecular biology experiments, such as flow cytometry, Western blot, immunocytochemical staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and so on. Then, pathway agonists and inhibitors were used to investigate the mechanism of GaAD19. Finally, the mouse model of cervical cancer was established to evaluate the inhibitory effect of GaAD19 on tumor growth in U14 cervical cancer mice.ResultsGaAD19 induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of tumors. It also blocked the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. However, in the presence of a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)agonist, the effects of GaAD19 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle transition of cancer cells were suppressed.ConclusionThis study showed that GaAD19 can play an anti-cervical cancer role by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway. These results will be helpful in further exploring the mechanism of GaAD19 in the treatment of cervical cancer.","Apoptosis is the most prominent mode of programmed cell death and is necessary for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During cell apoptosis, a distinctive population of extracellular vesicles is generated, termed apoptotic vesicles (apoVs). ApoVs inherit a variety of biological molecules such as proteins, RNAs, nuclear components, lipids, and gasotransmitters from their parent cells. ApoVs have shown promising therapeutic potential for inflammation, tumors, immune disorders, and tissue regeneration. In addition, apoVs can be used as drug carriers, vaccine development, and disease diagnosis. Recently, apoVs have been used in clinical trials to treat a variety of diseases, such as temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis and the regeneration of functional alveolar bone. Here, we review the history of apoV research, current preclinical and clinical studies, and the potential issues of apoV application.",1
"CD47, a transmembrane protein, acts as a “do not eat me” signal that is overexpressed in many tumor cell types, thereby forming a signaling axis with its ligand signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) and enabling the tumor cells to escape from macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. Several clinical trials with CD47 targeting agents are underway and have achieved impressive results preliminarily. However, hematotoxicity (particularly anemia) has emerged as the most common side effect that cannot be neglected. In the development of CD47 targeting agents, various methods have been used to mitigate this toxicity. In this review, we summarized five strategies used to alleviate CD47 blockade-induced hematotoxicity, as follows: change in the mode of administration; dual targeting bispecific antibodies of CD47; CD47 antibodies/SIRPα fusion proteins with negligible red blood cell binding; anti-SIRPα antibodies; and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase like inhibitors. With these strategies, the development of CD47 targeting agents can be improved.","Infants are vulnerable to infections due to a limited ability to mount a humoral immune response and their tolerogenic immune phenotype, which has impeded the success of newborn vaccination. Transplacental transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from mother to fetus provides crucial protection in the first weeks of life, and maternal immunization has recently been implemented as a public health strategy to protect newborns against serious infections. Despite their early success, current maternal vaccines do not provide comparable protection across pregnancies with varying gestational length, placental, and maternal immune features, nor do they account for the dynamic interplay between the maternal immune response and placental transfer. Moreover, progress toward the rational design of maternal vaccines has been hindered by inadequacies of existing experimental models and safety challenges of investigating longitudinal dynamics of IgG transfer in pregnant humans. Alternatively, in silico mechanistic models are a logical framework to disentangle the processes regulating placental antibody transfer. This review synthesizes current literature through a mechanistic modeling lens to identify placental and maternal regulators of antibody transfer, their clinical covariates, and knowledge gaps to guide future research. We also describe opportunities to employ integrated modeling and experimental approaches toward the rational design of vaccines against existing and emerging neonatal pathogen threats.",0
"Despite the notable efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, resistance in most individuals necessitates additional investigation. For this study, we collected tumor tissues from nine HCC patients receiving anti-PD1 monotherapy and conducted RNA sequencing. These findings revealed significant upregulation of GSDME, which is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in anti-PD1-resistant patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated levels of GSDME+ macrophages in HCC tissues presented a poorer prognosis. The analysis of single-cell sequencing data and flow cytometry revealed that the suppression of GSDME expression in nontumor cells resulted in a decrease in the proportion of M2-like macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TIME) of HCC while concurrently augmenting the cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells. The non-N-terminal fragment of GSDME within macrophages combines with PDPK1, thereby activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and facilitating M2-like polarization. The small-molecule Eliprodil inhibited the increase in PDPK1 phosphorylation mediated by GSDME site 1. The combination of Eliprodil and anti-PD1 was effective in the treatment of both spontaneous HCC in c-Myc + /+;Alb-Cre + /+ mice and in a hydrodynamic tail vein injection model, which provides a promising strategy for novel combined immunotherapy.","This article explores the development of T cell-based therapies in Switzerland. These therapies, which elicit the immunological potential of each patient to respond to tumor development, constitute a major promise for so-called ‘precision oncology’. We document how immunological concepts, technologies, and practices are articulated given the centrality of genomics in ‘precision oncology’. We consider ‘precision immunotherapies’ to probe whether and how change ensues in these established sociotechnical regimes of biomedicine. The case of genomics and immunology in oncology offers a unique insight into the conditions of possibility for change in such regimes. How does the present new wave of cancer immunotherapies challenge, integrate, and complement the centrality of genomics in ‘precision oncology’? What are the specific processes that make possible the convergence, competition, or co-existence of distinct conceptions, infrastructures, and programs of innovative cancer medicine? Drawing from observations and interviews with researchers and clinicians, we qualify these sociotechnical processes as hybridizations. Bringing together different sociotechnical regimes of biomedical research is conditional to the articulation of core concepts, technologies, and translational practices of genomics and immunology. Pivotal to this objective are neoantigens, cell surface proteins originating from the somatic genetic mutations of tumors and which activate a patient’s immune response. While neoantigens are an unstable entity in experimentation, they offer a conceptual and material substrate to renegotiate the dominance of cancer genomics, and initiate the production of a new, hybrid regime of ‘immunogenomic precision’ in oncology.",0
"CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, plays an important role not only in the immune system but also in tumor progression. CD40 ligation reportedly promotes autophagy in immune cells. However, the effects of CD40 ligation on autophagy and its mechanism in solid tumor cells are still unclear. In this study, we find that CD40 ligation promotes autophagosome formation and consequently promotes autophagic flux in cervical cancer cells. Mechanistically, this effect relies on ERK contributing to CD40 ligation-induced ATG13 upregulation by p53. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CD40 ligation-induced autophagy increases the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer cells. Taken together, our results provide new evidence for the involvement of the CD40 pathway in autophagy and radiotherapy in cervical cancer cells.","AbstractThe interaction between Tim‐3 on T cell and its ligand, Galectin‐9, negatively regulates cellular immune responses. However, the role of Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 pathway in the immune evasion of cervical cancer remains unknown. This study is to investigate the expression, function, and regulation of Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 signaling pathway in human papilloma virus (HPV) positive cervical cancer. Flow cytometry showed that Tim‐3 expression on T cell and Galectin‐9 expression on monocytes in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly higher compared to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and benign uterine fibroids Tim‐3 + CD4+ Th1 cells and Tim‐3 + CD8+ T cells in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly reduced after surgery. Serum TGF‐β and IL‐10 levels were positively correlated with Tim‐3 + Treg cells, while IFN‐γ and IL‐2 were negatively correlated with Tim‐3 + Th1 cells. Additionally, Tim‐3 + CD4+ T cells were positively correlated with Galectin‐9 + monocytes. Survival curve analysis showed that Tim‐3 + CD4+ T cells were negatively correlated with patient survival, and closely related to FIGO stage, degree of differentiation, and lymph node metastasis of HPV positive cervical cancer. In vitro experiments showed that by blocking the Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 pathway, the proliferation of T cells and their ability to express IFN‐γ, IL‐2, perforin, and granzyme B was significantly restored. In conclusion, high levels of Tim‐3 and Galectin‐9 in HPV positive cervical cancer patients play roles in the progression of disease by promoting Treg cells to inhibit the cytotoxic function of Th1 and CD8+ T cells. Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 may serve as a new immunotherapy target for patients with HPV positive cervical cancer.",1
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) prolong the survival for advanced/metastatic patients with lung cancer or melanoma; however, for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, a durable response has not been reported. Herein, we used a total of 719 HCC patients with public genomic data to determine potential prognostic and immunogenic subtypes. The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method was applied to identify the immune classes and potential subtypes. The proportion of tumor infiltration immune cells was estimated using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was utilized to calculate the dysregulated pathways. By using NMF analysis for the gene expression profile of the top immune genes, one HCC subtype with better survival (that is, low-risk subtype) and another with worse survival (that is, high-risk subtype) were identified in 3 HCC cohorts (all P < 0.05). Better immune cell infiltration, increased enrichment of immune signatures, higher expression of checkpoints, and elevated tumor mutation load (TML) were significantly enriched in the low-risk subtype (all P < 0.05). Higher mutation rates of immune response genes (for example, TP53 and MUC16) were also observed in the low-risk subtype (both P < 0.05). Discovery of the HCC low-risk subtype might provide clues for HCC prognosis and immunotherapy prediction.","BackgroundPatients with glioma have limited treatment options and experience poor prognoses. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the relevance of WSC domain-containing 2 (WSCD2) expression to glioma, clinicopathological characteristics, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TILs), and patient prognosis.MethodsWe analyzed WSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues and patient survival using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. Furthermore, the relationship between the expressions of WSCD2 mRNA and TILs in gliomas was evaluated utilizing the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Lastly, we employed multiplex immunohistochemistry to detect the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues.ResultsWSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues was lower than that in tissues of benign brain disease. High WSCD2 mRNA expression was also significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, WSCD2 mRNA expression was correlated with TIL expression in glioma; however, no such relationship was detected between the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues. Cox regression multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that WSCD2 expression in glioma tissues could be an independent prognostic factor.ConclusionThis study highlights the correlation between WSCD2 expression and TILs and demonstrates the prognostic significance of WSCD2 in glioma. Furthermore, our results suggest that WSCD2 may be a potential immunotherapy target in glioma.",1
"BackgroundPancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) constitutes a lethal malignancy, notorious for its elevated mortality rates due to the difficulties in early diagnosis and rapid metastasis. The emerging paradigm of ferroptosis—an iron-catalyzed, regulated cell death distinguished by the accrual of lipid peroxides—has recently garnered scholarly focus. However, the expression landscape of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in PAAD and their prognostic implications remain enigmatic.MethodsWe undertook a rigorous quantification of FRGs in PAAD samples, sourcing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. These repositories also provided extensive metadata, encompassing mesenchymal stemness index (mRNAsi), genomic mutations, copy number variations (CNV), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and other clinical attributes. A predictive model was constructed utilizing Lasso regression analysis, and a co-expression study was executed to elucidate the complex interconnections between FRGs and other gene sets.ResultsIntriguingly, FRGs were substantially upregulated in the high-risk cohort, even in the absence of clinically manifest symptoms, emphasizing their utility as prognostic biomarkers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant enrichment of immune and tumor-related pathways in this high-risk demographic. Striking heterogeneities in immune function and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification were observed between the low- and high-risk groups. Our analysis further implicated a cohort of genes—including LINC01559, C11orf86, SERPINB5, DSG3, MSLN, EREG, FAM83A, CXCL5, LY6D, and PSCA—as cardinal mediators in PAAD pathogenesis. A convergence of our predictive model with an analysis of CNVs, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and drug sensitivities, revealed an intricate relationship with the FRGs.ConclusionsOur findings accentuate the salient role of FRGs as critical modulators in the pathogenesis and progression of PAAD. Importantly, our composite prognostic framework offers invaluable insights into PAAD clinical trajectory. Moreover, the complex crosstalk between FRGs and immune cell landscapes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may elucidate prospective therapeutic strategies. The clinical translational utility of these insights, however, requires further in-depth empirical exploration. Accordingly, the FRG signature introduces a compelling new avenue for risk stratification and targeted therapeutic interventions in this devastating malignancy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05478-4.","PurposeThis study aimed to investigate whether N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related long non-coding RNAs (m6ARelncRNAs) could provide novel tools to predict overall survival of renal clear cell carcinoma.MethodsThe transcriptomic data and clinical information of patients with renal clear cell carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed. Distinct m6A modification patterns were systemically analysed via consensus clustering analysis. An m6ARelncRNA signature was constructed in the training cohort using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis and validated in the test cohort. Potential predictive accuracy of the signature was further assessed via Kaplan–Meier survival, univariate and multivariate Cox regression and subgroup analyses. The Tumour Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm was used to investigate the role of m6ARelncRNAs in guiding immunotherapy for patients with renal carcinoma.ResultsAn m6ARelncRNA signature based on only six lncRNAs was successfully constructed. The high-risk group derived from this signature had significantly poorer overall survival in both training and test cohorts (p < 0.001). Independent prognostic analysis further revealed that m6ARelncRNA risk (p < 0.01) was an independent risk factor for survival outcomes of renal carcinoma. TIDE algorithm revealed that immunotherapy response was poorer in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity analysis based on IC50 revealed that high-risk patients were potentially sensitive to various anti-tumour drugs, including bortezomib, cisplatin, docetaxel, etoposide and sunitinib.Conclusionm6ARelncRNAs provide novel tools that can be used to predict overall survival and examine the immune microenvironment of renal clear cell carcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04389-0.",1
"Cancer mortality primarily stems from metastatic recurrence, emphasizing the urgent need for developing effective metastasis-targeted immunotherapies. To better understand the cellular and molecular events shaping metastatic niches, we used a spontaneous breast cancer lung metastasis model to create a single-cell atlas spanning different metastatic stages and regions. We found that premetastatic lungs are infiltrated by inflammatory neutrophils and monocytes, followed by the accumulation of suppressive macrophages with the emergence of metastases. Spatial profiling revealed that metastasis-associated immune cells were present in the metastasis core, with the exception of TREM2+ regulatory macrophages uniquely enriched at the metastatic invasive margin, consistent across both murine models and human patient samples. These regulatory macrophages (Mreg) contribute to the formation of an immune-suppressive niche, cloaking tumor cells from immune surveillance. Our study provides a compendium of immune cell dynamics across metastatic stages and niches, informing the development of metastasis-targeting immunotherapies.","Background:Routine vaccination coverage for adolescents living in the rural US is lower than adolescents living in urban areas. We sought to measure the effect of Boot Camp Translation (BCT), a community-based participatory intervention, on rural adolescent vaccination coverage.Methods:A cluster randomized controlled trial was performed September 2018-November 2021 involving 16 rural Colorado counties. Intervention county community members engaged in BCT to develop interventions to improve adolescent vaccination locally. Adolescent vaccination coverage was measured using the Colorado Immunization Information System.Results:For 11-12-year-olds, HPV initiation, HPV up-to-date, MenACWY, and Tdap vaccination coverage was lower post- versus pre-intervention in the control and intervention groups. For 11-12-year-olds in the intervention group, there was no significant difference post- versus pre-intervention in the odds of HPV vaccine initiation (adjusted ratio of odds ratios [aROR] = 0.93, 95 %: 0.85–1.02, p = 0.10) or up-to-date HPV vaccination (aROR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 0.98–1.23, p = 0.11) compared with the control group. Among 11-12-year-olds, the decrease in the proportion vaccinated with MenACWY and Tdap in the intervention group was significantly greater than the control group. Among 13-17-year-olds, there were significant increases in HPV initiation, HPV up-to-date, MenACWY, and Tdap vaccination coverage from pre- to post-intervention for both groups, with no significant differences between groups.Conclusion:11-12-year-old vaccination coverage decreased slightly from pre- to post-intervention while 13-17-year-old vaccination coverage increased. We saw no effect from the BCT intervention. Our findings about the effectiveness of BCT for improving vaccine uptake may not be generalizable because the study coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic.Clinical Trial Registry:This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03955757.",0
"ABSTRACTHS-1793 is a novel derivative of resveratrol, a compound known for its numerous beneficial effects, including anticancer activity, anti-inflammatory response, antimicrobial, antiaging, anti-cardiovascular disease activity, neuroprotective activity, etc. Despite its wide and interesting properties, resveratrol suffers from a crucial flaw because it is low bioavailable. For this reason, many other derivatives were explored and among them, HS-1793 has caught the attention of researchers. HS-1793 is a synthetic derivative of resveratrol discovered in 2007 that has been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the compound showed a positive profile in metabolic processes, with adequate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This review highlights current research on HS-1793, evaluating in vitro and in vivo works and lays the foundation for novel explorative trials in human diseases.","Aim: The current work is an extension to our previous work for the development of new thalidomide analogs.Materials & methods: Quinazolinone-based molecules carrying a glutarimide moiety have been designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated for immunomodulatory and anticancer activity.Results: Compounds 7d and 12 showed considerable immunomodulatory properties in comparison to thalidomide. 7d and 12 significantly reduced TNF-α levels in HepG-2 cells from 162.5 to 57.4 pg/ml and 49.2 pg/ml, respectively, compared with 53.1 pg/ml reported for thalidomide. Moreover, they caused 69.33 and 77.74% reduction in NF-κB P65, respectively, compared with 60.26% reduction for thalidomide. Similarly, they reduced VEGF from 432.5 to 161.3 pg/ml and 132.8 pg/ml, respectively, in comparison to 153.2 pg/ml reported for thalidomide. The two new derivatives, 7d and 12 also showed about eightfold increases in caspase-8 levels in cells treated with them. These results were slightly better than those of thalidomide. The obtained results revealed that Compound 12 had better immunomodulatory properties than thalidomide, with stronger effects on TNF-α, NF-κB P65, VEGF and caspase-8.Conclusion: This work indicates that compounds 7d and 12 have interesting biological properties that should be further evaluated and modified in order to develop clinically useful thalidomide analogs.",1
"Background:Axitinib plus pembrolizumab showed superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) versus sunitinib in a randomised phase III trial in patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). We report long-term efficacy and safety of the axitinib/pembrolizumab from the phase I trial (NCT02133742), after 46–55 months from study initiation (data cut-off date, 23rd July 2019).Methods:Fifty-two treatment-naïve patients with advanced RCC were treated with oral axitinib 5 mg twice daily and intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. PFS, duration of response (DoR) and OS were summarised using the Kaplan–Meier method.Results:At a median follow-up of 42.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.1–44.1), median OS was not reached; 38 (73.1%) patients were alive. The probability of being alive at 4 years was 66.8% (95% CI: 49.1–79.5). Median PFS in the overall population was 23.5 months (95% CI: 15.4–30.4). ORR was 73.1%; five patients had complete response. Median DoR was 22.1 months (95% CI: 15.1–34.5). Grade III/IV adverse events (AEs) were reported in 38 (73.1%) patients and 20 (38.5%) discontinued treatment because of AEs: 17 (32.7%) discontinued axitinib, 13 (25.0%) discontinued pembrolizumab, and 10 (19.2%) discontinued both drugs. Common AEs included diarrhoea (84.6%), fatigue (80.8%), hypertension (53.8%), cough (48.1%) and dysphonia (48.1%). There were no new AE terms reported and no treatment-related deaths.Conclusions:In patients with advanced RCC with ~4 years of follow-up, combination axitinib/pembrolizumab continued to demonstrate clinical benefit, with no new safety signals.","Over the last decade, cancer diagnostics has undergone a notable transformation with increasing complexity. Minimally invasive diagnostic tests, driven by advanced imaging and early detection protocols, is redefining patient care and reducing the need for more invasive procedures.

In this article, we explore ancillary testing modalities and the role of biomarkers in organ-specific contexts, underscoring the transformative impact of precision medicine. Finally, the advent of more than 80 FDA-approved predictive biomarkers signals a new era, guiding cancer care toward personalized and targeted strategies.",0
"Evolving evidence indicates that tumor cells can transdifferentiate between distinct transcriptionally-determined cell states with changes in resultant phenotypes, a phenomenon known as cellular plasticity. These transitions are not driven by genetic mutations and typically in contrast to normal developmental processes, may proceed bidirectionally. Here, we review the role of cellular plasticity in the aggressive childhood solid tumor, neuroblastoma. We discuss the detection of two cell states, termed mesenchymal (MES) and adrenergic (ADRN), their properties and the transcriptional circuitries that control them, their relation to the normal embryogenesis of the sympathetic nervous system and their potential role in drug resistance, escape from therapy and development of relapse.","PurposeCell death plays an important role in tumourigenesis and progression; nevertheless, the clinical significance of cell death-related genes in neuroblastoma remains incompletely understood.MethodsWe separately constructed the corresponding risk scores for each of the eight cell death pathways separately and assessed their predictive performance. Through Cox regression analysis, these eight risk scores were integrated to obtain final cell death risk scores (CDRS). We evaluated the predictive performance of CDRS in multiple datasets and compared its accuracy with the clinical characteristics of patients and some existing prognostic models for neuroblastoma. We then explored the differences in immune infiltration between the high and low CDRS groups, and the significance of CDRS on EFS and disease progression.ResultsAll eight risk scores have high predictive accuracy, with the Immunogenic-RS being the most accurate and the cuproptosis-RS the least accurate. Model genes are mainly enriched in a variety of cancer-related pathways and are closely related to the clinical characteristics. CDRS showed superior and robust predictive performance in multiple datasets and was more accurate than the clinical characteristics of patients and some existing prognostic models for neuroblastoma. High CDRS group featured distinct immune cold tumor profiles and may have poorer immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy. CDRS had significance in predicting EFS and disease progression.ConclusionWe integrated risk scores associated with multiple cell death pathways to develop a high-performing and robust neuroblastoma signature. CDRS was a promising tool that may help with risk assessment and prediction of overall prognosis, and thus improve clinical outcomes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04605-5.",1
"The therapeutic options for advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) have drastically evolved over the past 20 years. High-dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2), which led to durable complete responses in a small fraction of patients by activating the interleukin-2 (IL-2) pathway, faded in popularity with the advent of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against the VEGF pathway (VEGFR-TKI) showing better tolerability, wider applicability, and higher objective response rates (ORR) and longer progression-free survival (PFS) than HD IL-2. More recently, new insights on how to more efficiently harness the immune system led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies, which rapidly became an integral component of mRCC treatment. The recently approved regimen combining the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, and the CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, and the recently approved regimens combining the oral VEGFR-TKI, axitinib, with the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, or the PD-L1 inhibitor, avelumab, were shown to yield improved outcomes compared with sunitinib, the VEGFR-TKI that was used as a comparator. The present review discusses the evidence behind the treatment approvals for mRCC and provides an overview of the current therapeutic landscape. We evaluated the results of randomized clinical trials for mRCC based on the effect size differences between treatments on relative scales and used second-generation p-values as a descriptive summary of the statistical evidence.","AbstractBackgroundHormone receptor–positive (HR+) breast cancer responds poorly to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In some settings, radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to mediate immunostimulatory effects and promote ICI sensitivity.MethodsWe investigated whether hypofractionated RT may be successfully combined with ICIs in a mouse model of multifocal, metachronous HR+ mammary carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that focal RT targeting the first detectable (primary) tumor combined with ICIs may generate effective immunity, delaying the development of new lesions.ResultsFocal RT in various doses and fractionations limited primary tumor growth, with an optimum for a 20-Gy × 2 regimen (ablative in approximately 90% of mice). The degree of primary disease control, however, did not necessarily correlate with overall survival extension because of changes in the development of new neoplastic lesions contributing to global tumor burden. Adding a PD-1 blocker to focal RT delivered in a 10-Gy × 3, 20-Gy × 2, or 8-Gy × 6 regimen failed to alter overall survival extension enabled by RT alone. Similar results were obtained with a CTLA4 blocker, an IL-1β inhibitor, and a PD-1 blocker plus recombinant FLT3LG when combined with the 10-Gy × 3 regimen.ConclusionsIn this model of HR+ mammary carcinogenesis, RT to the primary tumor ameliorates overall survival (to an extent based on dose and fractionation). Increasing local control through RT alone or RT plus immunotherapy beyond a hitherto undefined threshold, however, does not necessarily inhibit the development of subsequent nonirradiated neoplasms and hence does not necessarily provide extra overall survival benefits.",0
"Introduction:Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are treated with surgery-based multimodality approach or definitive chemoradiation therapy plus durvalumab consolidation. It is not clear whether surgery-based multimodality therapy has any survival advantage over definitive chemoradiation plus immunotherapy consolidation.Method:National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify NSCLC patients at stage IIIA (AJCC8, T3N1/T4N0–1 or T1N2/T2N2) who are treated with surgery-based multimodality approach or definitive chemoradiation plus durvalumab. Survival between groups were compared using inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results were independently confirmed by Landmark Inverse and Clone Censor Weight analyses to address immortal time bias.Results:From 2017 to 2019, 24,170 patients are identified as potentially resectable stage IIIA (T3N1, T4N0–1, T1N2/T2N2). Among them, 2,615 (10.8%) received surgery-based multimodality therapy and 2,985 (12.4%) received definitive chemoradiation plus durvalumab. Surgery based multimodality approach had significant survival advantage over definitive chemoradiation plus durvalumab (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.69–0.79, P < .001). The median overall survival (mOS) for the definitive chemoradiation plus durvalumab group was 48.59 m whereas mOS was not reached for surgery-based multimodality group. This trend persisted in both N2 negative and positive tumors. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was just as effective as adjuvant chemotherapy and delay of immunotherapy consolidation to 12 weeks after initiation of chemoradiation did not negatively affect survival outcome.Conclusion:For stage IIIA NSCLC patients, surgery-based multimodality treatment outperformed chemoradiation plus durvalumab in survival.","ObjectiveTo study the surgical outcomes of patients with a second primary lung cancer after the extrapulmonary malignancy.Materials and methodsPatients who underwent surgical resection for lung cancers between January 2005 and December 2014 were reviewed. Clinical data, imaging characteristics of tumors, surgical approaches, and outcomes were analyzed with a mean follow-up of 97 months.ResultsOf 1075 patients, 166 (15.4%) had a second primary lung cancer after extrapulmonary malignancy. There were no differences in overall 5-year survival rates (81.8% for the group of lung cancer vs. 72.9% for the second primary lung cancer group, p = 0.069) and 5-year disease-free survival (70.1% for the lung cancer group vs. 70.3% for the second primary lung cancer group, p = 0.863) between the two groups. Gender, performance status, tumor size, and maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) were significantly different between the two groups. After propensity-score matching analysis, patients in the group with lung cancers had better 5-year overall survival (88.1% vs. 72.1% for the group with second primary lung cancers, p = 0.016) and 5-year disease-free survival (80.6% vs. 70.3% for the group with second primary lung cancers; p = 0.054). In the second primary lung cancer group, the patients with preceding breast or thyroid cancers had better prognoses than did those with other extrapulmonary malignancy.ConclusionsSecond primary lung cancers following extrapulmonary malignancies were not uncommon. Surgical resection is considered for early stage secondary primary lung cancer after meticulous work up and result in fair outcome.",1
"Head and neck cancers (HNC) are aggressive, difficult-to-treat tumors that can be caused by genetic factors but mainly by lifestyle or infection caused by the human papillomavirus. As the sixth most common malignancy, it presents a formidable therapeutic challenge with limited therapeutic modalities. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is appearing as a promising multitarget anticancer and antimetastatic agent. Numerous studies have shown that curcumin and its derivatives have the potential to affect signaling pathways (NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and EGFR) and molecular mechanisms that are crucial for the growth and migration of head and neck tumors. Furthermore, its ability to interact with the tumor microenvironment and trigger the immune system may significantly influence the organism’s immune response to the tumor. Combining curcumin with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy may improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the side effects of treatment, thereby increasing its therapeutic potential. This review is a comprehensive overview that discusses both the benefits and limitations of curcumin and its therapeutic effects in the context of tumor biology, with an emphasis on molecular mechanisms in the context of HNC. This review also includes possibilities to improve the limiting properties of curcumin both in terms of the development of new derivatives, formulations, or combinations with conventional therapies that have potential as a new type of therapy for the treatment of HNC and subsequent use in clinical practice.","ImportanceRecurrent/metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (R/M AdCC) presents a clinical challenge with limited treatment options, particularly in the face of unsatisfactory efficacy from current therapeutic approaches. This review underscores the unmet clinical needs in managing R/M AdCC, emphasising the imperative for novel therapeutic strategies to address this critical gap.ObjectiveThe primary objective of this review is to comprehensively analyse and assess trials investigating therapeutic approaches for R/M AdCC. Emphasis is placed on endpoints such as tumour response rates and progression-free survival. The specific interventions, populations, and outcomes examined in these trials will be detailed to provide a focused and informative systematic review.Evidence reviewThe systematic search spanned databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Employing terms like “Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic” and “trial,” the search focused on English full-text articles from April 1, 2010, to August 9, 2023. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies with patients having R/M AdCC, involving drug interventions. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for retrospective studies, Cochrane ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised trials, and the ROB-2 tool for randomised controlled trials.FindingsA total of 46 trials involving 1244 patients are included in this review, encompassing a variety of therapeutic approaches for R/M AdCC. Targeted therapies, particularly Apatinib at 500 mg, exhibit efficacy with a 47.1% objective response rate (ORR). Conversely, immunotherapeutic agents demonstrate suboptimal performance, with an overall ORR ranging from 0 to 18%. While Apatinib shows promise, the review underscores the imperative for a thorough exploration of drugs targeting unique mechanisms in the immunologically cold nature of R/M AdCC.Conclusions and relevanceSubstantial progress in systemic therapy for R/M AdCC is evident, driven by early-phase clinical trials, particularly with promising outcomes in VEGF-2 inhibitors. However, challenges persist, notably in immunotherapy due to the cancer’s immunologically cold nature. Ongoing research, prioritising early-stage trials, is crucial, emphasising exploration of emerging therapies like cell therapy and antibody–drug conjugates. Transitioning to Phase III trials is essential for more precise therapeutic insights. Collaborative efforts and a focus on personalised precision medicine are vital for overcoming challenges and advancing our understanding of treatment efficacy in this rare cancer.",1
ABSTRACTLatest developments in the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine compiled from publicly available information and press releases from non-academic institutions in September 2024.,"Antibody inhibitors pose an ongoing challenge to the treatment of subjects with inherited protein deficiency disorders, limiting the efficacy of both protein replacement therapy and corrective gene therapy. Beyond their central role as producers of serum antibody, B cells also exhibit many unique properties that could be exploited in cell therapy applications, notably including antigen-specific recognition and the linked capacity for antigen presentation. Here we employed CRISPR-Cas9 to demonstrate that ex vivo antigen-primed Blimp1-knockout “decoy” B cells, incapable of differentiation into plasma cells, participated in and downregulated host antigen-specific humoral responses after adoptive transfer. Following ex vivo antigen pulse, adoptively transferred high-affinity antigen-specific decoy B cells were diverted into germinal centers en masse, thereby reducing participation by endogenous antigen-specific B cells in T-dependent humoral responses and suppressing both cognate and linked antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G following immunization with conjugated antigen. This effect was dose-dependent and, importantly, did not impact concurrent unrelated antibody responses. We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of this approach by treating factor VIII (FVIII)-knockout mice with antigen-pulsed decoy B cells prior to immunization with an FVIII conjugate protein, thereby blunting the production of serum FVIII-specific IgG by an order of magnitude as well as reducing the proportion of animals exhibiting functional FVIII inhibition by 6-fold.",1
"The Organ Preservation in patients with Rectal Adenocarcinoma (OPRA) trial was a randomized, non-blinded, phase II prospective study investigating total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) and a selective “watch-and-wait” (WW) approach in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). It compared two TNT regimens: induction chemotherapy-chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT) and chemoradiotherapy-consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT). Depending on tumor response, patients were offered WW or surgery. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), hypothesizing that patients who underwent TNT with selective WW would have improved DFS compared to historical rates. Secondary endpoints included organ preservation (OP) and overall survival, hypothesizing that differences between INCT-CRT and CRT-CNCT could indicate a superior regimen.Results demonstrated treatment of LARC with TNT and selective WW allows for OP in approximately half of patients without negatively impacting oncologic outcomes such as DFS. The data show that a CRT-CNCT regimen had higher rates of OP, lower rates of tumor regrowth, and similar DFS compared to INCT-CRT. Lastly, DFS does not differ between patients who undergo immediate TME versus TME after regrowth. Thus, patients treated with TNT who achieve a clinical complete response (cCR) can safely undergo WW with the potential for OP.Current research to improve TNT and enhance cCR will expand the utility of the WW approach, including the intensification of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Janus trial), comparing short-course and long-course CRT prior to CNCT (ENSEMBLE and German trials), utilizing fluoropyrimidine-chemotherapy with and without oxaliplatin in the context of WW (CHOW trial), and exploring less invasive operative approaches for early-stage tumors (NEO and NEO II trials).","BackgroundSelenium, a natural microelement with both nutritional and toxicological properties, is intertwined with tumorigenesis and progression. However, it is not fully understood how selenium metabolism affects immune response and cancer biology.MethodsWe estimated selenium metabolism by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to delineate the selenium metabolism landscape using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and a integrated pan-cancer single-cell dataset. We systematically explored the prognostic implications of selenium metabolism and selenium-related regulatory patterns. The therapeutic value of selenium metabolism was explored through machine learning and examined in several immunotherapy cohorts. The heterogeneity and underlying mechanism of selenium metabolism were investigated by cell‒cell communication analysis at the single-cell level.ResultsA GSEA analysis based on 86 genes was used to evaluate the selenium metabolism landscape. The selenium metabolism score exhibited prognostic value in predicting the lower risk of mortality, possibly due to its correlation with multiple cancer hallmarks, including a positive correlation with complement (R = 0.761, P < 0.001), inflammatory response (R = 0.663, P < 0.001), apoptosis (R = 0.626, P < 0.001), hypoxia (R = 0.587, P < 0.001), reactive oxygen species (ROS) (R = 0.558, P < 0.001), and interferon gamma response (R = 0.539, P < 0.001). We also observed heterogeneity in the relationship between selenium metabolism and immunity across different cancers. Based on selenium-related genes, we constructed a machine learning model with area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.82 in predicting immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based immunotherapy response. Single-cell selenium metabolism quantification revealed that adjacent and tumor tissues had higher selenium metabolism compared with normal tissues, especially in epithelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages. The communication between high-selenium epithelium and high-selenium fibroblast was significantly higher than other cells, especially in cytokines, chemokines, collagen, Wnt, VEGF, IGF and FGF pathways.ConclusionOur study provides a comprehensive landscape of selenium metabolism levels and diverse regulatory patterns in different cancers, deepening the understanding of selenium’s roles in tumorigenesis and immunity.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05333-6.",0
"The rat model is an important resource in biomedical research due to its similarities to the human immune system and its use for functional studies. However, because of the preponderance of mouse models in foundational and mechanistic immunologic studies, there is a relative lack of diverse, commercially available flow cytometry antibodies for immunological profiling in the rat model. Available antibodies are often conjugated to common fluorophores with similar peak emission wavelengths, making them hard to distinguish on conventional flow cytometers and restricting more comprehensive immune analysis. This can become a limitation when designing immunological studies in rat injury models to investigate the immune response to tissue injury. In addition, this lack of available antibodies limits the number of studies that can be done on the immune populations in lymphoid organs in other research areas. To address this critical unmet need, we designed a spectral flow cytometry panel for rat models. Spectral cytometry distinguishes between different fluorophores by capturing their full emission spectra instead of their peak emission wavelengths. This flow cytometry panel includes twenty-four distinct immune cell markers to analyze the innate and adaptive immune response. Importantly, this panel identifies different immune phenotypes, including tolerogenic, Type 1, and Type 2 immune responses. We show that this panel can identify unique immune populations and phenotypes in a rat muscle trauma model. We further validated that the panel can identify distinct adaptive and innate immune populations and their unique phenotypes in lymphoid organs. This panel expands the scope of previous rat panels providing a tool for scientists to examine the immune system in homeostasis and injury while pairing mechanistic immunologic studies with functional studies.","AbstractObjectiveSjögren’s Disease (SjD) subjects have decreased lacrimal/salivary gland function. Studies have proposed that autoantibodies targeting G-protein-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine-type-3-receptor (M3R) are potential clinical markers for SjD. We hypothesized that rabbits/mice immunized with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)-modified/unmodified Ro60 will develop an autoimmunity, specifically a SjD phenotype, thus expressing increased levels of anti-M3R antibodies.MethodsWe immunized two rabbits each with 10 mM HNE-modified Ro60/unmodified Ro60 antigen or Ro274-290/Ro413-428/Ro500-517 Ro60 peptides. Two rabbits each were immunized with either M3R second extracellular loop (ECL2) or M3R ECL3 peptide. Finally, five groups of BALB/c mice were immunized as follows—Group-I immunized with Ro60, Groups-II—IV immunized with Ro60 modified with 0.4 mM (low), 2 mM (medium), and 10 mM (high) HNE, respectively and Group-V—Freund’s adjuvant. Serum antibodies to M3R ECL2/ECL3/Ro60/La or Sm were detected by ELISA. Functional assays were also performed.ResultsImmunization with HNE-modified Ro60/unmodified Ro60 antigen or Ro274/Ro 413/Ro500 peptides induced a rapid intermolecular epitope spreading to M3R ECL2/ECL3, especially to M3R ECL3 in HNE-Ro immunized rabbits. These animals did not bind to scrambled M3R peptides. Ro60-immunized rabbit IgG inhibited M3R activity in a functional assay. Rabbits immunized with ECL2/ECL3 developed high reactivity to Ro60 but not against Sm/RNP. We found a differential antibody-induction against M3R ECL2 with Group-3 mice developing significant reactivity.ConclusionOur data show induction of increasing anti-M3R antibodies in rabbits immunized with Ro60/HNE-Ro60 or Ro60 peptides and differential induction of these antibodies in mice immunized with Ro60 modified with increasing HNE. These findings suggest that M3R ECL2/ECL3 are involved in SjD autoimmunity progression.",0
"AbstractPediatric brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children. Even to date, with the advances in multimodality therapeutic management, survival outcomes remain dismal in some types of tumors, such as pediatric-type diffuse high-grade gliomas or central nervous system embryonal tumors. Failure to understand the complex molecular heterogeneity and the elusive tumor and microenvironment interplay continues to undermine therapeutic efficacy. Developing a strategy that would improve survival for these fatal tumors remains unmet in pediatric neuro-oncology. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging as a feasible, safe, and promising therapy for brain tumors. The new paradigm in virotherapy implies that the direct cytopathic effect is followed, under certain circumstances, by an antitumor immune response responsible for the partial or complete debulking of the tumor mass. OVs alone or combined with other therapeutic modalities have been primarily used in adult neuro-oncology. A surge in encouraging preclinical studies in pediatric brain tumor models recently led to the clinical translation of OVs with encouraging results in these tumors. In this review, we summarize the different virotherapy tested in preclinical and clinical studies in pediatric brain tumors, and we discuss the limitations and future avenues necessary to improve the response of these tumors to this type of therapy.","ABSTRACTPeople living with cancer have a profound need to understand any potential negative impacts of treatment on their everyday lives and whether the treatment itself could cause other long-term health challenges. This podcast brings together the perspectives of a patient, patient advocates and an oncologist, to highlight opportunities to better support people in understanding the possible side effects of a treatment and potential impact on quality of life. In addition to bridging gaps between the perspectives of healthcare providers and patients, it may be helpful to support people in interpreting relevant clinical trial findings. With this in mind, two accompanying visual guides use patient-friendly language to help people understand how safety and quality of life are measured in clinical trials.",1
"Malignant melanoma is a common and often aggressive neoplasm of the skin arising from melanocytes. Metastatic melanoma is known for its diverse clinical manifestations, and can present with atypical features prior to diagnosis of the primary lesion, which can pose a diagnostic challenge. We report a rare case of metastatic melanoma in a 67 year-old male who presented with a painless, enlarging mass in the right axilla over a 4 week period. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a well-defined solitary, cystic appearing lesion in the right axilla with a distinct fluid–fluid level. An ultrasound guided biopsy of the lesion diagnosed a metastatic melanoma. While haemorrhagic distant metastases are a well-recognised complication of malignant melanoma, particularly in the brain and lung, soft tissue metastases presenting with fluid–fluid levels is not well described in the literature. The case highlights the importance of considering the differential of melanoma metastasis when encountered with such a lesion and importance of ultrasound guided biopsy for histopathological confirmation, as the imaging features can mimic that of a haemorrhagic soft tissue sarcoma, the management of which differs substantially from that of melanoma.","Imaging technologies have revolutionized the study of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by leveraging spatial analysis, which enables the exploration of tissue organization and cellular communication, as well as aiding cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, while many advanced spatial analysis methods have been recently published, they are enmeshed with specific imaging technology. An opportunity exists to develop a technology-agnostic methodology that captures complex spatial patterns in the TME as phenotypes to use in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel variation of spatial g-function and a comprehensive imaging-technology-agnostic framework that identifies rich spatial phenotypes that can be used in survival analysis and classification tasks. Applying our methodology to breast cancer, we uncover spatial phenotypes with significance to survival across racial groups and molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We find other phenotypes that are significant to the survival of specific patient categories (such as African American). We also demonstrate that our phenotypes reflect specific biological contexts. These results highlight the relevance of our proposed spatial analysis and phenotype discovery pipeline and demonstrate the benefits of the systematic exploration of spatial phenotypes for more personalized diagnosis and treatments.",0
"PurposeTo compare the toxicity and clinical efficacy of TL (docetaxel + lobaplatin) induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy and TPF (docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Methods and patientsIn total, 128 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled between August 2016 and April 2021. They were randomly divided into trial group and control group, all using chronological dosage mode. The trial group used TL regimen induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy; the control group used TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The endpoints were adverse events and survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years.ResultsMedian follow-up was 42 months (20–71 months).  Adverse events: During induction chemotherapy, compared with TPF group, grade 3–4 leukocytes and neutrophils, diarrhea, 1–2 hyperbilirubinemia, nausea / vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, hyponatremia were significantly lower in TL group (p<0. 05): 6% vs. 35%, 14% vs. 53%, 0% vs. 6%, 15% vs. 40%, 9% vs. 56%, 0% vs. 10%, 3% vs. 13%, 2% vs. 23%, 15% vs. 74%. During chemoradiotherapy, the incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalaemia and grade 1–2 nausea was significantly lower in the TL group (p<0. 05), with 24% vs. 69%, 20% vs. 65% and 24% vs. 44%, respectively. However, more grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia were observed in the TL group (15% vs. 3%, p<0. 05).  There was no significant difference in the recent objective response rate (ORR) between patients with TL group and TPF group (p=0.961).  There was no statistical difference in 1, 3 and 5 years OS between TL group and TPF group, respectively, (71.0% vs. 67.5%, p=0.573), (56.6% vs. 56.9%, p=0.814), (52.5% vs. 52.9%, p=0.841); 1, 3 and 5 years PFS are: (63.4% vs. 64.0%, p=0.883), (51.1% vs. 54.0%, p=0.705) and (47.3% vs. 45.9%, p=0.887), None of them were significantly different. Multivariate analysis of COX regression showed that T stage (p=0.01) and surgery (p=0.046) were independent factors affecting PFS and OS, respectively. OS subgroup analysis shows that people receiving the TL regimen in postoperative and nodal stage N1 and N2 patients tended to survive longer than those receiving the TPF regimen.ConclusionPatients with postoperative, N1 or N2 stage locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may have more significant clinical benefits when treated with TL regimen. TL regimen has advantages in reducing toxic side effects and can be used as one of the first-line treatment options.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03117257).","PurposeAs a novel antiangiogenic multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved in China, anlotinib has exhibited promising anticancer efficacy and acceptable safety profile in the salvage treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in clinical trials. Here we retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third- or further-line treatment in patients with refractory SCLC.Patients and methodsA total of 40 patients with refractory SCLC treated with anlotinib monotherapy were included in this study. The clinicopathological data, treatment information, survival data and safety data were retrospectively collected. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed by log-rank testing.ResultsAltogether, 40 patients of extensive-stage SCLC or progressive limited-stage SCLC received anlotinib monotherapy as third- or further-line treatment from July 2018 to June 2020. Four patients achieved partial response (PR), 14 patients achieved stable disease (SD), no complete response (CR) was recorded, and 22 patients experienced progressive disease (PD). The disease control rate (DCR) was 45.0%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.241–3.759), and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.8 months (95% CI 3.190–12.410). The common adverse effects (AEs) included hypertension, fatigue, anorexia, cough, rash and nausea. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 3 (7.5%) patients. One patient interrupted anlotinib treatment due to repeated grade 1 epistaxis. Univariate analysis revealed that patients without liver metastases, previously treated with radiotherapy or with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0 or 1 had longer OS with anlotinib treatment. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients without liver metastases and patients with ECOG score ≤ 1 had longer PFS, while patients without liver metastases had longer OS.ConclusionAnlotinib is beneficial to refractory SCLC as third- or further-line treatment, especially in patients without liver metastasis and with better physical status. Related adverse effects are tolerable and manageable.",1
"PurposeThe expression of NKG2D ligands and PD-L1 has been detected on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, as well as normal cells of the myeloid lineage. To target leukemic cells while minimizing collateral damage to normal cells, we constructed a split dual CAR system based on the AND-gate logic.MethodsThe NKG2D extracellular domain linked with DAP12 without a co-stimulatory signal was used for the basal activation of T cells, and used together with the PD-L1-specific chimeric costimulatory receptor containing the 4-1BB activating domain for co-stimulatory signal 2 input. This dual CAR displayed cell-type specificity and activity similar as a 2nd generation NKG2D ligand-specific CAR.ResultsWhen compared to CD64 and PD-L1-specific 2nd generation CARs, we observed that the split dual CAR offered an improved myeloid cell type selectivity. For example, PD-L1-specific CAR-T cells lysed all tested myeloid cell types that expressed PD-L1, including M0 macrophages (Mø0), LPS-polarized Mø1, IFN-γ polarized Mø1, IL-4 polarized Mø2, monocytes, immature dendritic cells (imDCs), mature DCs, as well as KG-1 AML cells, while the dual CAR-T cells displaying killing activity only towards LPS polarized Mø1, mature DCs and KG-1 cells that expressed both NKG2D ligands and PD-L1. In a mouse liquid tumor model, the dual CAR-T cells were effective in eradicating established KG-1 AML xenografts.ConclusionThe improved cell type specificity offered by our split dual CAR-T cell system targeting paired antigens would favour the reduction of the on-target off-tumor toxicity towards normal myeloid cells during the treatment of myeloid leukaemia.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04865-1.","PurposeIn recent times, multiple molecular subtypes with varying prognoses have been identified in bladder cancer (BLCA). However, the attributes of butyrate metabolism-related (BMR) molecular subtypes and their correlation with immunotherapy response remain inadequately explored in BLCA.MethodsWe utilized 594 samples of BLCA to investigate the molecular subtypes mediated by BMR genes and their correlation with the immunotherapy response. To quantify the BMR features of individual tumors, we developed a BMR score through the COX and LASSO regression methods. Clinical-related, tumor microenvironment, drug-sensitive and immunotherapy analyses were used to comprehensively analyze BMR scores.ResultsTwo distinct molecular subtypes related to butyrate metabolism were identified in BLCA, each with unique prognostic implications and immune microenvironments. BMR score was constructed based on 7 BMR genes and was used to classify the patients into two score groups. Clinical analysis revealed that the BMR score was an independent prognostic factor. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. The BMR score can also predict tumor immunity. The results demonstrated that a low BMR score was associated with higher efficacy of immunotherapy, which was also validated by an external dataset.ConclusionOur study proposes both molecular subtypes and a BMR-based score as promising prognostic classifications in BLCA. These findings may offer new insights for the development of precise targeted cancer therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05067-5.",0
"BackgroundPatients with glioma have limited treatment options and experience poor prognoses. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the relevance of WSC domain-containing 2 (WSCD2) expression to glioma, clinicopathological characteristics, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TILs), and patient prognosis.MethodsWe analyzed WSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues and patient survival using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. Furthermore, the relationship between the expressions of WSCD2 mRNA and TILs in gliomas was evaluated utilizing the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Lastly, we employed multiplex immunohistochemistry to detect the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues.ResultsWSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues was lower than that in tissues of benign brain disease. High WSCD2 mRNA expression was also significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, WSCD2 mRNA expression was correlated with TIL expression in glioma; however, no such relationship was detected between the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues. Cox regression multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that WSCD2 expression in glioma tissues could be an independent prognostic factor.ConclusionThis study highlights the correlation between WSCD2 expression and TILs and demonstrates the prognostic significance of WSCD2 in glioma. Furthermore, our results suggest that WSCD2 may be a potential immunotherapy target in glioma.","The utilization of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, specifically anti-PD-1/L1 agents, prior to radical cystectomy is an emerging paradigm in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a health concern affecting millions of men globally, with a concerning rise in incidence in the Philippines, a country that faces a complex set of barriers to equitable access to quality PCa care. In this article, we describe the unique geographic, economic, socio-cultural, and political factors that influence access to screening, diagnosis, treatment, and supportive services in the country, and explore avenues for development. The country lacks a nationwide PCa registry to inform resource allocation and guide PCa cancer care programs and policy. Misconceptions, cultural barriers and negative attitudes about PCa among Filipino men adversely influence health-seeking behavior. Inadequate insurance coverage, and high out-of-pocket costs obstruct access to essential care. Geographic and political factors contribute to the uneven distribution of healthcare resources needed for comprehensive PCa care, including access to medical specialists, essential medicines, and surgical and radiotherapeutic equipment. Overcoming these challenges requires a collaborative effort encompassing robust data collection, awareness campaigns to reshape societal norms, policy and economic reforms, infrastructure improvements, and enhanced collaboration among healthcare professionals to provide evidence-based care. Addressing these issues holistically can pave the way to better outcomes and improved quality of life for Filipino men with this life-altering disease.","IntroductionThe urinary microbiome (UMB) includes living bacteria, their genomes, and their products from interactions with the host environment. A “core” UMB could potentially exist, with variations between age and sex groups. Changes in UMB composition have been associated with benign urological disorders, but also with urologic cancers. Mechanisms through which UMB can trigger and maintain cancer can be local inflammation and interaction with immune system.Aim of the studyTo describe the association between UMB and development of urologic cancers.MethodsA non-systematic literature review identified recently published studies (last 5 years), involving human patients, dealing with UMB. The database used for this review was PubMed, and the identified studies served as the base for a narrative analysis of the literature that explored the potential associations between UMB and urological cancers.ResultsIn bladder cancer (BC), UMB may play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (and thus to progression to metastasis), as well as in effectiveness of BCG response rate. BC is also associated with changes in UMB, with bacterial richness indices increased in cancer groups compared to non-neoplastic groups and being different between NMIBC vs MIBC patients. In prostate cancer (PCa), there is an abundance in proinflammatory bacteria and uropathogens. In regard to renal cell carcinoma (RCC), penile cancer and testicular cancer there are still too few studies to draw significant conclusions about its relationship with the UMB.ConclusionsGaining a deeper understanding of UMB role in urologic tumors could aid in the development of new therapies and improve classification of patients’ risk.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDThe effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy against glioblastoma (GBM) remains limited. This study aims to identify cancer-specific antigens to develop antigen-based cancer immunotherapies for GBM. We investigated candidate tumor antigen-specific T cells in GBM by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq), and we explored candidate antigens through genetic analysis of tumor tissues. METHODSFlow cytometry analysis was conducted on fresh tumor digest samples to evaluate tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of GBM. Single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing were performed on CD8+ T cells in TILs. Both data generated by Cell Ranger software were loaded into Seurat at R studio. The dimensional reduction for clustering was performed with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Additionally, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole exome sequencing (WES) on tumor tissues. RESULTSTwo out of 20 patients (10%) exhibited abundant TILs in GBM. From these two patients, approximately 20,000 CD8+ T cells in total were analyzed in single-cell analysis. Clustering based on UMAP revealed a predominance of clusters expressing exhaustion markers, with high TCR clonality centered on exhausted T cell (TEX) clusters, like our previous date of lung cancer TILs recognizing tumor antigens. Moreover, within the TEX clusters, the expression of CXCL13, often reported as an antigen-specific marker in recent years, was significantly higher in our data compared to two publicly available datasets. Subsequently, based on RNA-seq and WES, 61 candidate neoantigens were estimated using machine-learning prediction algorithms from NEC Corporation. Furthermore, 5 overexpressed cancer/testis antigens, and 3 bacterial species-derived microbial peptides using Kraken2 were selected as antigen candidates. CONCLUSIONSWe identified prospective tumor antigen-specific T cell subsets with high CXCL13 expression from two GBM patients. We plan to identify cancer-specific T cells and antigens from these candidates by T cell activation assay.","BackgroundCopper homeostasis imbalance has been implicated in tumor progression, aggressiveness, and treatment response. However, the precise roles of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood.MethodsIn this study, we employed a consensus clustering algorithm to identify distinct molecular subtypes. We then performed Kaplan–Meier analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis to identify prognostic differentially expressed genes. The expression of these genes was subsequently validated using qPCR on fresh-frozen tissues obtained from HCC patients. Moreover, leveraging the TCGA-HCC cohort, we constructed a CRGs-related risk prediction model using the LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analysis.ResultsBy analyzing the data, we successfully established a CRGs risk prognostic model for HCC patients, comprising five differential genes (CAD, SGCB, TXNRD1, KDR, and MTND4P20). Cox regression analysis revealed that the CRGs risk score could serve as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.308, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.200 − 1.426, P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) values of the CRGs-score for predicting 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 0.785, 0.724, and 0.723, respectively. Notably, the expression levels of immune checkpoints (including PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4) significantly differed between the low- and high-risk score groups. Furthermore, the low-risk score group displayed increased sensitivity to sorafenib, cisplatin, cyclopamine, nilotinib, salubrinal, and gemcitabine, whereas the high-risk score group exhibited heightened sensitivity to lapatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the potential of the CRGs risk score as an independent and promising biomarker for clinical prognosis and immunotherapy sensitivity in HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05099-x.",0
"The advancements in the detection and characterization of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have revolutionized precision medicine and are likely to transform standard clinical practice. The non‐invasive nature of this approach allows for molecular profiling of the entire tumor entity, while also enabling real‐time monitoring of the effectiveness of cancer therapies as well as the identification of resistance mechanisms to guide targeted therapy. Although the field of ctDNA studies offers a wide range of applications, including in early disease, in this review we mainly focus on the role of ctDNA in the dynamic molecular characterization of unresectable locally advanced and metastatic BC (mBC). Here, we provide clinical practice guidance for the rapidly evolving field of molecular profiling of mBC, outlining the current landscape of liquid biopsy applications and how to choose the right ctDNA assay. Additionally, we underline the importance of exploring the clinical relevance of novel molecular alterations that potentially represent therapeutic targets in mBC, along with mutations where targeted therapy is already approved. Finally, we present a potential roadmap for integrating ctDNA analysis into clinical practice.","Conventional forms of noninvasive cardiovascular imaging that evaluate morphology, function, flow, and metabolism play a vital role in individual treatment decisions, often based on guidelines. Innovations in molecular imaging have enhanced our ability to spatially quantify the expression of a wider array of disease-related proteins, genes, or cell types, or the activity of specific pathogenic pathways. These techniques, which usually rely on design of targeted imaging probes, have already been used extensively in cancer medicine and have now become part of cardiovascular care in conditions such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis. The recognition that common cardiovascular conditions are caused by a substantial diversity of pathobiologic pathways and the diversity of therapies available for use have rekindled interest in expanding the role of molecular imaging of tissue phenotype to improve precision in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making. The intent of this article is to raise awareness and understanding of approaches to molecular or cellular imaging of phenotype with targeted probes, and their potential to promote the principles of precision medicine. Also addressed are the diverse roles of molecular imaging to improve precision and efficiency of new drug development at the stages of candidate identification, preclinical testing, and clinical trials.",1
"BackgroundLiver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) significantly impact chemo-resistance and recurrence in liver cancer. Dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) is known to enhance the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype in glioblastoma and correlates with poor prognosis in some non-central nervous system tumors; however, its influence on LCSCs remains uncertain.MethodsTo investigate the gene and protein expression profiles of DRD4 in LCSCs and non-LCSCs, we utilized transcriptome sequencing and Western blotting analysis. Bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry were employed to assess the correlation between DRD4 expression levels and the pathological characteristics of liver cancer patients. The impact of DRD4 on LCSC phenotypes and signaling pathways were explored using pharmacological or gene-editing techniques. Additionally, the effect of DRD4 on the protein expression and intracellular localization of β-catenin were examined using Western blotting and immunofluorescence.ResultsDRD4 expression is significantly elevated in LCSCs and correlates with short survival in liver cancer. The expression and activity of DRD4 are positive to resistance, self renewal and tumorigenicity in HCC. Mechanistically, DRD4 stabilizes β-catenin and promotes its entry into the nucleus via activating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway, thereby enhancing LCSC phenotypes.ConclusionsInhibiting DRD4 expression and activation offers a promising targeted therapy for eradicating LCSCs and relieve chemo-resistance.","BackgroundHigh tumor mutation burden (TMB) failed to serve as a favorable prognostic biomarker for immunotherapy across all tumors. This study aimed to explore TMB-sensitive tumors on a pan-cancer level and construct their immune infiltration phenotypes in TMB-high groups.MethodsPan-cancer patients were separated into TMB-high and TMB-low groups based on the median TMB values per tumor. TMB-related genes were identified using differently expressed genes (DEGs) and differently mutated genes (DMGs) between the above two TMB groups. CIBERSORT algorithm was used to estimate the abundance of 22 tumor immune infiltrating cells (TIICs). Consensus clustering analysis was applied to predict molecular subtypes. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the correlations between hub genes and TIICs and immunomodulator genes.ResultsNine TMB-sensitive tumors were identified by high-frequency of TMB-related genes. A total of 126 tumor-specific hub genes (1 in BLCA, 19 in BRCA, 4 in COAD, 4 in HNSC, 25 in LUAD, 2 in LUSC, 27 in SKCM, 37 in STAD, and 7 UCEC) were identified. In five out of nine TMB-sensitive tumors, the molecular subtypes based on hub gene expression were characterized by TMB values, prognostic values and tumor-specific TIICs levels. In TMB-high groups, hub genes associated immune infiltration phenotypes were constructed with key TIICs and immunomodulators spanning TMB-sensitive tumors.ConclusionsOur tumor-specific analysis revealed hub genes associated immune infiltration features may serve as potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers of immunotherapy, providing the potential underlying mechanism of immune infiltration in TMB-high groups across TMB-sensitive tumors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04139-2.",1
"Innate immunity, cell death and inflammation underpin many aspects of health and disease. Upon sensing pathogens, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or alarmins, the innate immune system activates inflammatory cell death, such as pyroptosis and PANoptosis. These genetically-defined, regulated cell death pathways not only contribute to the host defense against infectious disease, but also promote pathological manifestations leading to cancer and inflammatory diseases. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms has grown rapidly in recent years. However, how dying cells, cell corpses, and their liberated cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory signalling molecules are further sensed by innate immune cells, and their contribution to further amplify inflammation, trigger antigen presentation, and activate adaptive immunity, is less clear. Here, we discuss how pattern-recognition and PANoptosome sensors in innate immune cells recognize and respond to cell-death signatures. We also highlight molecular targets of the innate immune response for potential therapeutic development.","AbstractNecroptosis, a cell death mechanism with the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. Induction of necroptosis for cancer therapy may be possible through the regulation of the expression of a key factor gene receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3 (RIPK3) via in vitro transcription (IVT) mRNA delivery. However, mRNA is susceptible to degradation and has a low delivery efficiency, which highlights the requirement of a proper delivery vehicle for intracellular delivery. Therefore, a new mRNA delivery system based on the nanostructured silica nanoparticles, termed mRNA‐protective nanocage (mPN) has been developed. High‐efficiency expression of RIPK3 and induction of necroptosis is achieved through delivery of RIPK3 IVT mRNA with mPN in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, the mPN carrying RIPK3 mRNA distributed locally in tumors upon intravascular injection, and successfully induced necroptosis and immune cell infiltration, a hallmark of necroptosis. the suppression of tumor growth in a murine cancer model, demonstrating the synergistic effect of RIPK3 mRNA‐ and immune cell‐mediated therapy is also observed. These findings suggest the potential for anticancer therapy through necroptosis induction and provide a strategy for the development of mRNA‐based nanomedicine.",1
"BackgroundThyroid carcinoma (THCA) represents a prevalent form of cancer globally, with its incidence demonstrating an upward trend in recent years. Accumulating evidence has indicated that programmed cell death (PCD) patterns exert a vital influence on tumor progression. Nevertheless, the association between PCD and the prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma remains to be elucidated. The current study endeavors to examine the link between PCD and the prognosis of thyroid cancer while concurrently developing a prognostic index based on PCD genes.Materials and methodsProgrammed cell death patterns were employed to construct the model and define clusters. Gene expression profile genomics and clinical data pertaining to 568 patients with thyroid cancer were sourced from the TCGA database. In addition, single-cell transcriptome data GSE184362 were procured from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for subsequent analysis.ResultsThe study harnessed six machine learning algorithms to create a programmed cell death signature (PCDS). Ultimately, the model developed via SVM was chosen as the optimal model, boasting the highest C-index. Moreover, the application of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) led to the identification of two molecular subtypes of THCA, each characterized by distinct vital biological processes and drug sensitivities. The investigation revealed that PCDS is linked to chemokines, interleukins, interferons, and checkpoint genes, as well as pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment, as determined through a comprehensive analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomes. Patients with THCA and elevated PCDS values are more inclined to exhibit resistance to conventional chemotherapy regimens, yet may display heightened responsiveness to targeted therapeutic agents. Finally, we established a nomogram model based on multivariable cox and logistic regression analyses to predict the overall survival of THCA patients.ConclusionThis research sheds new light on the role of programmed cell death (PCD) patterns in THCA. By conducting an in-depth analysis of various cell death patterns, a novel PCD model has been devised, capable of accurately predicting the clinical prognosis and drug sensitivity of patients with THCA.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05252-6.","PurposeThis study aims to establish a risk prediction model based on prognosis-related genes (PRGs) and clinicopathological factors, and investigate the biological activities of PRGs in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).MethodsRisk score signatures were developed by employing multiple algorithms and their amalgamations. A predictive model for overall survival was established through the integration of risk score signatures and several clinicopathological parameters. A comprehensive single-cell atlas, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to investigate the biological activities of prognosis-related genes in LUAD.ResultsA risk prediction model was established based on 16 PRGs, exhibiting robust performance in predicting overall survival. The single-cell analysis revealed that epithelial cells were primarily associated with worse survival of LUAD, and PRGs were predominantly enriched in malignant epithelial cells and influenced epithelial cell growth and progression. Furthermore, GSEA and GSVA analysis showed that PRGs were involved in tumor pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hypoxia and KRAS_UP, and high GSVA scores are correlated with worse outcome in LUAD patients.ConclusionsThe constructed risk prediction model in this study offers clinicians a valuable tool for tailoring treatment strategies of LUAD and provides a comprehensive interpretation on the biological activities of PRGs in LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05403-9.",1
"PurposeProgrammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) are immunosuppressive proteins known to be associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. However, their expression and clinical relevance in osteosarcoma remain unknown. In this study, the relationships of PD-L1 and IDO1 expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis were explored.MethodsThe expression of PD-L1, IDO1, CD3, CD4, and CD8 in 112 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues collected by biopsy or surgical resection from 56 osteosarcoma patients was evaluated immunohistochemically. Moreover, four osteosarcoma cell lines were evaluated for the effects of IFNγ on PD-L1 and IDO1 mRNA expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.ResultsIn pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) primary specimens, 10 cases (17%) showed PD-L1 expression and 12 (21%) showed IDO1 expression. Six of ten cases (60%) with PD-L1 positivity co-expressed IDO1. In post-NAC metastatic lesions, the frequency of immunoexpression of PD-L1 and IDO1 was increased compared with that in pre-NAC specimens. PD-L1 and/or IDO1 expression was not associated with poor prognosis. PD-L1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells; while, IDO1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T cells. In all osteosarcoma cell lines, PD-L1 and IDO1 expression was upregulated by stimulation with IFNγ.ConclusionOur results suggest that the PD-L1 and IDO1 immune checkpoint inhibitors may provide clinical benefit in osteosarcoma patients with metastatic lesions after conventional chemotherapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03242-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","IntroductionTumor immunotherapy has recently emerged as a crucial focal point in oncology treatment research. Among tumor immunotherapy approaches, tumor immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have attracted substantial attention in clinical research. However, this treatment modality has benefitted only a limited number of patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of various biomarkers to decipher their prognostic implications in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who are treated with ICIs, and thus identify predictive markers with practical clinical relevance.MethodsA systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify clinical studies that examined the correlation between biomarkers and treatment outcomes in the HNSCC patients. The included articles were screened and analyzed to extract data regarding overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).ResultsThe relationship between the biomarkers included in the summary and prognosis was as follows: HPV positivity was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58–1.99), PFS (HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.81–1.67), and response (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.37–2.99). PD-L1 positivity was associated with OS (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.59–0.85), PFS (HR = 0.56 95% CI = 0.43–0.73), and response (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.51–3.10). Neither HPV positivity nor PD-L1 positivity was associated with DCR. The following markers were collected for OS and PFS data and were associated with longer OS: lower Glasgow prognostic score (GPS/mGPS) grading, lower PS grading, high body mass index (BMI), low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), low platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), high albumin (Alb), low lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Factors associated with better PFS were lower GPS/mGPS grading, lower PS grading, high BMI, low NLR, high absolute lymphocyte count, and low LDH. Hyperprogressive disease was associated with worse OS and PFS. Fewer clinical studies have been completed on the tumor microenvironment and hypoxia, microsatellite instability/DNA mismatch repair, and microbiome and systematic analysis is difficult.ConclusionIn our meta-analysis, different immune checkpoint factors were associated with different prognoses in HNSCC patients receiving immunotherapy. HPV, PD-L1, BMI, Alb, HPD, PS, GPS/mGPS, LDH, NLR, and PLR predicted the ICI outcome in HNSCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05504-5.",1
"PurposeHistory of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC) has been associated with survival following the diagnosis of a second primary malignancy (SPM), with the direction of the association varying by cancer type. Research is needed to elucidate the role of other key factors in this association.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients newly diagnosed and/or treated at Moffitt Cancer Center in December 2008–April 2020 with breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL) (n = 29,156). History of KC was obtained from new patient intake questionnaires. Age- and stage-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the association between history of KC and survival following each cancer, stratified by demographic/clinical characteristics.ResultsKC history was most prevalent in patients with melanoma (28.7%), CLL (19.8%) and lung cancer (16.1%). KC history was associated with better overall survival following prostate cancer (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55–0.99) and poorer overall survival following CLL (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.10–2.71). Patients with a history of KC experienced better survival within the first four years of a melanoma diagnosis (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92); whereas poorer survival was observed for patients who survived 7 + years after a melanoma diagnosis (HR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.17–4.05). Stratification by treatment and stage revealed directional differences in the associations between KC history and survival among patients with breast cancer and melanoma.ConclusionsKC history may be a predictor of survival following an SPM, possibly serving as a marker of immune function and/or DNA damage repair capacity.","PurposeThe CCR5/CCL5 axis is essential for interactions between malignant cells and microenvironment components, promoting tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aims to evaluate the association of CCL5 and CCR5 with the behavior of oral cancer and assess the therapeutic potential of a CCR5 antagonist.MethodsA retrospective study to analyze CCR5 and CCL5 expression on paraffin-embedded tissues was performed. In cell lines, rhCCL5 was added to induce CCR5-related pathways, and Maraviroc and shRNA against CCR5 were used to neutralize the receptor. Finally, an in vivo murine orthotopic xenograft model of tongue cancer was used to evaluate Maraviroc as an oncologic therapy. After 15 days, the mice were killed, and the primary tumors and cervical lymph nodes were analyzed.ResultsThe expression of CCR5 was associated with clinical stage and metastasis, and CCL5 was related to overall survival. Adding rhCCL5 induced cell proliferation, while shRNA and Maraviroc reduced it in a dose-dependent manner. Maraviroc treatment also increased apoptosis and modified cytoskeletal organization. In vivo, Maraviroc reduced neck metastasis.ConclusionsThe effects of CCR5 antagonists in OSCC have been poorly studied, and this study reports in vitro and in vivo evidence for the effects of Maraviroc in OSCC. Our results suggest that the CCR5/CCL5 axis plays a role in oral cancer behavior, and that its inhibition is a promising new therapy alternative.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05443-1.",1
"AbstractBackground and AimsOver the last decade, treatment options for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) have expanded. However, comparative studies between these agents are limited, especially among biologic-naive patients. We aimed to compare the persistence, effectiveness, and safety of tofacitinib and vedolizumab as the first advanced treatment for patients with UC.MethodsPatients who received either tofacitinib or vedolizumab as their first advanced therapy for UC in NHS Lothian were included. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting. The probability of treatment assignment was calculated via logistic regression using age, sex, UC duration, Montreal extent, C-reactive protein, concomitant corticosteroids, and partial Mayo score at drug commencement.ResultsWe included n = 158 patients, of whom n = 81 (51.3%) received vedolizumab and n = 77 (48.7%) tofacitinib. Median follow-up for vedolizumab patients was 3.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.6-4.8) and for tofacitinib patients 1.5 years (IQR 0.3-2.3). The cohort was 59.5% male with a median age of 41.1 years (IQR 31.5-51.8). At 2 years, vedolizumab persistence was superior to tofacitinib (p = 0.005). At Weeks 12 and 52, clinical, biochemical, and fecal biomarker steroid-free remission were comparable between groups. Primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response were 9.9% and 17.3% for vedolizumab and 23.4% and 13% for tofacitinib, respectively. The frequency of adverse events was comparable (11 [13.6%] vedolizumab vs 19 [24.7%] tofacitinib, p = 0.629).ConclusionsWe found that the persistence and tolerability of vedolizumab were superior to tofacitinib in bio-naive UC, although the rates of clinical and biomarker remission were comparable. These data may help inform the positioning of advanced therapy.","PurposeNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is ranked the top otorhinolaryngology malignant tumors in the world. However, the general prognosis of recurrent and metastatic (R/M) nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) remains poor, and current surgery and chemoradiotherapy do not generate satisfactory outcomes.MethodsAs a new therapeutic choice, immunotherapy, especially with regard to the development of checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors have made considerable progress in recent years. As Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with increased risk of NPC, EBV-related immunotherapy may lead to a breakthrough in advanced NPCs.ResultsIn this review, we summarized the clinical characters of NPC, and several past and ongoing clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors and EBV-CTLs (CTLs: cytotoxic T lymphocytes) in R/M NPC immunotherapy.ConclusionWe conclude that although the evaluated effects of new immunotherapy drugs have brought us hope on NPC treatment, further phase II-III trials with larger samples are still required to improve the proportion and scheme of drug collocation for better clinical outcomes and less drug-related safety.",0
"Background:Approximately 30% of cancer patients experience kidney complications, which hinder optimal cancer management, imposing a burden on patients’ quality of life and the healthcare system. The etiology of kidney complications in cancer patients is often attributed to oncological therapies. However, the direct impact of cancer on kidney health is underestimated. Our previous study demonstrated that metastatic lung cancer adversely alters the kidney, and exacerbates chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, indicating lung cancer-kidney crosstalk. The current study examines whether this phenomenon is specific to the employed cancer model.Methods:Female and male mice of various strains were injected with different cell lines of remote organ cancer, and their kidney tissues were analyzed for toxicity and fibrosis.Results:The impact of cancer on the kidney varied by cancer type. Breast cancer and specific subtypes of lung cancer, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant cancer, pathologically altered kidney physiology and function in a manner dependent on the metastatic potential of the cell line. This was independent of mouse strain, sex, and cancer cell line origin. Moreover, tumor DNA was not detected in the renal tissue, excluding metastases to the kidney as a causative factor for the observed pathological alterations. Lewis lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma did not cause nephrotoxicity, regardless of the tumor size.Conclusion:Our results confirm cancer-kidney crosstalk in specific cancer types. In the era of precision medicine, further research is essential to identify at-risk oncology populations, enabling early detection and management of renal complications.NEW & NOTEWORTHYCancer patients frequently experience kidney complications, often attributed to antineoplastic therapies. This emphasis on therapy-induced nephrotoxicity has led to the underestimation of the impact of cancer on the kidney. Our study demonstrates that distant organ cancer is sufficient to induce nephrotoxicity, highlighting the existence of cancer-kidney crosstalk. Our findings underscore a gap in our understanding of renal complications in cancer patients and provide a rationale for identifying the underlying mechanisms for the development of nephroprotective agents.","PurposeTP53/EGFR co-mutation has been reported to affect the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, its impact on survival is unclear. In this analysis, we explored the prognostic effect of TP53/EGFR co-mutation in LUAD.MethodsClinical data and transcriptome sequencing of LUAD patients with matched genomic data were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for overall survival (OS) analysis. Differential expression genes (DEGs) were recognized by R software and bioconductor package. Clusterprofiler was used for functional analysis. STRING was used for estimating PPI information and plug-in CytoHubba to screen hub modules in Cytoscape. The association between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and survival was also analyzed.ResultsOS was shorter for patients carrying TP53 mutation (MUT) than that of wild type (WT) (37.7 m vs 52.8 m; p = 0.040, HR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.01–1.89). Dual TP53/EGFR-MUT was associated with inferior OS compared with the dual WT/WT cohort (38.4 m vs 51.9 m; p = 0.023, HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.95–3.52). 316 DEGs between dual TP53/EGFR-MUT and dual WT/WT samples were obtained and functional analysis made known that DEGs were strikingly enriched in regulating the metabolism of important amino acids, cell division, cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix composition. KEGG analysis discovered that DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and extracellular matrix receptor interaction. PPI network suggested that GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY genes were up-regulated in dual mutation samples. OS in the high TMB cohort was significantly better than that in the low TMB in patients with TP53 MUT(43.2 m vs 32.4 m; P = 0.007, HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81), as well as in the combination of TP53 MUT and EGFR WT group (44.4 m vs 31.2 m; P = 0.021, HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 − 0.89).ConclusionsTP53 MUT is a poor prognostic factor in LUAD patients, and the prognosis of TP53/EGFR co-mutation is worse. GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY may be novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for patients with dual TP53/EGFR mutation LUAD.",0
"BackgroundCheckpoint inhibitors (CKI) targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 are major therapies for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite numerous studies of biological biomarkers, we currently lack a marker to predict CKI primary resistance. The aim of this study was to isolate clinical markers associated with the absence of efficacy of CKI used as monotherapy in NSCLC.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 172 patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for advanced NSCLC at the Dijon Cancer Center. Baseline characteristics were compared using the Chi squared test between responders and non-responders. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test for univariate analysis. Cox regression models were used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).ResultsAmong 172 patients included, 149 (86.5%) received CKI after platinum chemotherapy. Response rate (RR) was 16%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 months (95% CI 0.7–30 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95% CI 0.7–46.8 months). By univariate analysis, WHO performance status ≥ 1, presence of bone, liver and pleuroperitoneal metastasis were associated with poor PFS and OS. Multivariate analysis showed that only pleuroperitoneal metastasis was independently associated with PFS and OS. Patients with pleuroperitoneal metastasis and WHO performance status ≥ 1 had a < 10% chance of yielding a benefit from CKI.ConclusionsOur data support the hypothesis that pleuroperitoneal metastasis is a major predictive factor affecting CKI efficacy in NSCLC patients and may be used to avoid CKI monotherapy for such patients.","PurposeCervical cancer (CC) patients are more likely to develop second primary malignancies (SPMs) than general population. With the advancement in cancer therapy, CC patients are achieving long-term survival, leading SPMs to our attention. Our study aims to establish diagnostic and prognostic nomograms for CC patients with second primary malignancies (CCSPMs) to help make personalized follow-up plans and treatments.MethodsData of CCSPMs between 2000 and 2019 was extracted from SEER. The proportions and the median interval time of CCSPM onset were calculated. 11 related clinical characteristics, including age, race, marital status, grade, FIGO stage, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, were further explore. Logistic and Cox regressions were employed to predict risk factors for CCSPMs diagnosis. Finally, two nomograms were developed to predict the probability occurrence and prognosis of CCSPMs, respectively.ResultsFor diagnostic nomogram construction, 59,178 CC patients were randomly divided into training (n = 41,426) and validation cohorts (n = 17,752). For prognostic nomogram construction, 3527 CCSPMs patients were randomly divided into training (n = 2469) and validation cohorts (n = 1058). The diagnostic nomogram consisting of above 11 independent risk factors (all P < 0.05), had high accuracy (AUCtraining = 0.851 and AUCvalidating = 0.845). The prognostic nomogram integrated with eight independent prognostic factors such as treatments, FIGO stage and TNM stage performed well in predicting 5-year OS (AUCtraining = 0.835 and AUCvalidating = 0.837).ConclusionOur diagnostic and prognostic nomograms could facilitate clinicians to quantify individual SPMs risk and survival probabilities and optimize the surveillance recommendations and personalized clinical decision-making.",0
"BackgroundTyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-PD-1 antibodies in combination provide survival benefits for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). However, the tool used to determine which patients likely benefit most from this treatment strategy has not been reported. We sought to develop a prognostic scoring system based on tumor burden score (TBS) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to predict the long-term prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies.MethodsData on patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies from multiple centers were collected. The prognostic accuracy of TBS, AFP, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and CTA (Combined TBS and AFP) for 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated.ResultsOverall, 278 patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies were enrolled, including 48 BCLC-B and 230 BCLC-C HCC patients. CTA (AUC = 0.721 and 0.683) outperformed TBS (AUC = 0.680 and 0.621), AFP (AUC = 0.606 and 0.594), and BCLC staging (AUC = 0.551 and 0.555) in predicting PFS and OS. The 2-year PFS and OS for low CTA (low TBS/low AFP) were 65.7% and 94.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than 21.6% and 44.9% (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002), respectively, for intermediate CTA (low TBS/high AFP or high TBS/low AFP) and 8.7% and 12.1% (both p < 0.001), respectively, for high CTA (high TBS/high AFP). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that CTA grading was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS (referent: low CTA; intermediate CTA, HR 2.87 and 7.17; high CTA, HR 5.52 and 10.31, respectively).ConclusionsCTA grading is an accurate tool for stratifying the prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies and may help determine which patients may benefit more from this treatment strategy.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematologic malignancy. Chemotherapy resistance results in a dismal survival rate of 1–2 years in older adults with AML. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently required. In this context, microRNA (miRNA)-based treatments remain an untapped strategy in AML. Using patient-derived specimens, we found increased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of older adults with AML, and decreased miR-497-5p in CD34+ leukemic blasts. Target prediction revealed that miR-497-5p could directly target mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAP2K1) mRNA to indirectly target cytokines and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway through the p38-MAPK signaling pathway, potentially inhibiting leukemic growth and overcoming chemoresistance from venetoclax. To improve miRNA delivery and minimize off-target effects, which represent key barriers to clinical translation, we developed liposomes for co-delivery of miR-497-5p and venetoclax. We decorated our liposomes with a peptide targeting CLL1, which is present on 92% of leukemia blasts while being absent in normal hematopoietic cells. This targeted approach demonstrated high efficacy in inhibiting AML growth in mice with minimal toxicity, as well as reduced exposure to chemoresistance. Our findings suggested that anti-CLL1-decorated, miR-497-5p, and venetoclax-loaded liposomes represent a promising novel miRNA-based therapeutic, which should be investigated further as a strategy to reduce venetoclax resistance in AML.",0
"PurposeThe benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors’ (ICIs) combination therapy in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remained unclear. We performed a meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of ICIs’ combination therapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC.MethodsA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ICIs’ combination therapy as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC was conducted via searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database. The data for efficacy and safety of ICIs’ combination therapy were subject to meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with different PD-L1 expression status.ResultsA total of 5 RCTs and 3163 patients were included. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) benefit with ICIs’ combination therapy was 0.68 (95% CI 0.62–0.75) compared with chemotherapy alone. The HR for progression-free survival (PFS) benefit and the odds ratio (OR) for overall response rate (ORR) increase were 0.62 (95% CI 0.56–0.68) and 2.01 (95% CI 1.70–2.38), respectively. The OS and PFS benefits with ICIs’ combination therapy over chemotherapy alone were also observed in the subgroup of PD-L1 positive expression, but not in the subgroup of PD-L1 negative expression. The incidence of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events was 60.4% with ICIs’ combination therapy and 56.3% with chemotherapy alone (OR, 1.19; 95% CI 0.90–1.57).ConclusionICIs’ combination therapy showed superior OS, PFS, and ORR over chemotherapy alone with a manageable safety profile. These results suggested that ICIs’ combination therapy can be considered as a new first-line treatment for advanced ESCC.","AbstractTherapies shown to improve outcomes in patients with recurrent cancers are commonly used in the neoadjuvant setting to optimize surgery, reduce radiation fields, and treat micrometastatic disease. While the use of pre-radiation chemotherapy (PRC) has flourished in systemic cancers, it has not seen the same level of use in glioblastomas. This review documents these trajectories and highlights the potential of PRC to rapidly and safely screen cytotoxic drugs for efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.Prospective trials of adults with newly diagnosed systemic and brain cancers treated with PRC published between 1980 and 2023 were identified in PubMed. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were used to document the standard use of PRC in patients with systemic and brain cancers.Over 5000 prospective PRC trials in solid tumors were identified. These accrued >1 million patients and resulted in neoadjuvant therapies being the standard of care in ~28 systemic cancers. Only 50 similar trials (2206 patients) were identified in high-grade gliomas. In 13 trials containing PRC temozolomide (n = 846), radiographic responses ranged from 6 to 53% with a median survival of ~13 months. Glioblastoma PRC trials were not associated with unexpected toxicities or major negative impacts on survival. Pre-radiation chemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma appears safe and feasible. The pre-radiation window is ideally suited to rapidly screen cytotoxic agents for efficacy. It permits radiographic response as a primary outcome, small sample sizes, and initiation of standard therapies a few months after diagnosis. Pre-radiation chemotherapy may be most appropriate for patients with glioblastoma who are unlikely to benefit from temozolomide.",0
"ABSTRACTHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer-related death with limited therapies, is a complex disease developing in a background of Hepatitis Virus infection or systemic conditions, such as the metabolic syndrome. Investigating HCC pathogenesis in model organisms is therefore crucial for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been instrumental in recapitulating the local and systemic features of HCC. Early studies using GEMMs and patient material implicated members of the dimeric Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, such as c-Jun and c-Fos, in HCC formation. In a recent report, we described how switchable, hepatocyte-restricted expression of a single-chain c-Jun~Fra-2 protein, functionally mimicking the c-Jun/Fra-2 AP-1 dimer, results in spontaneous and largely reversible liver tumors in GEMMs. Dysregulated cell cycle, inflammation, and dyslipidemia are observed at early stages and tumors display molecular HCC signatures. We demonstrate that increased c-Myc expression is an essential molecular determinant of tumor formation that can be therapeutically targeted using the BET inhibitor JQ1. Here, we discuss these findings with additional results illustrating how AP-1 GEMMs can foster preclinical research on liver diseases with novel perspectives offered by the constantly increasing wealth of HCC-related datasets.","AbstractBackgroundSuper-enhancers (SEs) typically govern the expression of critical oncogenes and play a fundamental role in the initiation and progression of cancer. Focusing on genes that are abnormally regulated by SE in cancer may be a new strategy for understanding pathogenesis. In the context of this investigation, we have identified a previously unreported SE-driven gene IRF2BP2 in neuroblastoma (NB).MethodsThe expression and prognostic value of IRF2BP2 were detected in public databases and clinical samples. The effect of IRF2BP2 on NB cell growth and apoptosis was evaluated through in vivo and in vitro functional loss experiments. The molecular mechanism of IRF2BP2 was investigated by the study of chromatin regulatory regions and transcriptome sequencing.ResultsThe sustained high expression of IRF2BP2 results from the activation of a novel SE established by NB master transcription factors MYCN, MEIS2, and HAND2, and they form a new complex that regulates the gene network associated with the proliferation of NB cell populations. We also observed a significant enrichment of the AP-1 family at the binding sites of IRF2BP2. Remarkably, within NB cells, AP-1 plays a pivotal role in shaping the chromatin accessibility landscape, thereby exposing the binding site for IRF2BP2. This orchestrated action enables AP-1 and IRF2BP2 to collaboratively stimulate the expression of the NB susceptibility gene ALK, thereby upholding the highly proliferative phenotype characteristic of NB.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that SE-driven IRF2BP2 can bind to AP-1 to maintain the survival of tumor cells via regulating chromatin accessibility of the NB susceptibility gene ALK.",1
"Atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of illness and mortality worldwide. The development of atherosclerosis is a complex process involving oxidative stress, surplus lipid deposition and retention, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. Developing novel anti-atherogenic and repurposing existing drugs requires the use of suitable animal models to characterise the fundamental mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis initiation and progression and to evaluate potential therapeutic effects. Commonly used rodent models, however, are not always appropriate, and other models may be required to translate these discoveries into valuable preventive and treatment agents for human applications. Recent advances in gene-editing tools for large animals have allowed the creation of animals that develop atherosclerosis faster and more similarly to humans in terms of lesion localisation and histopathology. In this review, we discuss the major advantages and drawbacks of the main non-rodent animal models of atherosclerosis, particularly rabbits, pigs, zebrafish, and non-human primates. Moreover, we review the application of recently invented novel therapeutic methods and agents, and repurposed existing drugs (such as antidiabetic and anticancer) for atherosclerosis treatment, the efficacy of which is verified on non-rodent animal models of atherosclerosis. In total, the proper selection of a suitable animal model of atherosclerosis facilitates reproducible and rigorous translational research in repurposing of existing drugs, discovering new therapeutic strategies, and validating novel anti-atherosclerotic drugs.","Oral cancer accounts for around 30 percent of all cancers in India. These cancers are usually managed either by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these modalities. Dental oncologists play an integral part in the multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists, nurses, physician assistants, nutritionists, psychologists and social workers to efficiently manage cancer patients. Oral complications associated with cancer therapy can range from minor mucositis or infections to severely debilitating conditions such as osteonecrosis of jaws, which can disrupt the ongoing cancer therapy and jeopardize the overall quality of life of the patient. This highlights the primary role of a dentist in the efficient identification and management of potential oral foci of infection and subsequent prevention of the onset of these complications. This necessitates accurate, evidence-based knowledge and extensive training of dental oncologists to provide state-of-the-art management strategies. This article aims to review oral management before, during and after therapy in patients undergoing treatment for cancers affecting the head and neck region.",0
"PurposeCuproptosis, a novel programmed cell death, plays an important role in glioma growth, angiogenesis, and immune response. Nonetheless, the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the prognosis and tumor microenvironment (TME) of gliomas remains unknown.MethodsBy non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering, 1286 glioma patients were classified based on the mRNA expression levels of 27 CRGs and investigated the association of immune infiltration and clinical characteristics with cuproptosis subtypes. A CRG-score system was constructed using LASSO and multivariate Cox regression methods and validated in independent cohorts to predict the prognosis of glioma patients.ResultsGlioma patients were divided into two cuproptosis subtypes. Cluster C2 was enriched in immune-related pathways, had higher macrophage M2, neutrophils, and CD8 + T cells, and poorer prognosis compared with cluster C1 which was enriched in metabolism-related pathways. We further constructed and validated the ten-gene CRG risk scores. Glioma patients in the high CRG-score group had higher tumor mutation burden, higher TME scores, and poorer prognoses compared with the low CRG-score group. Additionally, the AUC value of the CRG-score was 0.778 in predicting the prognosis of gliomas. WHO grading, IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT methylation were significant differences between high and low CRG-score groups.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that CRG-score was related to immune cell infiltration and could accurately predict gliomas’ prognosis. Our findings may provide a novel understanding of the potential role of cuproptosis molecular pattern and TME in the immune response and prognosis of glioma patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05021-5.","PurposeThe incidence and mortality of lung cancer are continuously rising in recent years. Mitochondrial energy metabolism malfunction is found to be crucial in cancer proliferation and bioenergetic reprogramming, especially for lung cancer. In this study, we attempted to use mitochondrial-targeted drug therapy to change the energy metabolism pattern of cancer cells to inhibit the development of lung cancer, and investigated its mechanism of action and key targets through multi-omics studies.MethodsIn this study, we established the in vivo tumor mouse mode, treated mice with multiple mitochondrial-targeted drug combinations and DDP, severally. Then, we investigated the differences between the 7-drug group with the control group and the DDP treatment group by transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to find the therapeutic targets.ResultsWe found that mitochondria-targeting drug cocktail therapy, especially the 7-drug regimen, effectively improved mitochondrial metabolism, changed energy supply patterns in lung cancer cells, significantly increased NK cells in tumor tissues, and decreased tumor markers in plasma. Multi-omics analysis informed that the combination of 7-drug could up-regulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthesis and autophagy related genes, and down-regulate proliferation and immune-related genes compared with the control group. By further mapping the protein interaction network, we identified a key target for 7-drug therapy to reverse tumor metabolic reprogramming and validated it in metabolomics.ConclusionsMitochondrial-targeted drug cocktail therapy can effectively inhibit the occurrence and development of tumors, through the reprogramming of energy metabolism and the increase in immune cells in tumor tissues. Thus, we provide a novel approach for the treatment of lung cancer and present evidence-based clues for the combined use of targeted mitochondrial drugs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05376-9.",0
"SummarySomatic mutations commonly occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Some mutant clones outgrow through clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and produce mutated immune progenies shaping host immunity. Individuals with CH are asymptomatic but have an increased risk of developing leukemia, cardiovascular and pulmonary inflammatory diseases, and severe infections. Using genetic engineering of human HSCs (hHSCs) and transplantation in immunodeficient mice, we describe how a commonly mutated gene in CH, TET2, affects human neutrophil development and function. TET2 loss in hHSCs produce a distinct neutrophil heterogeneity in bone marrow and peripheral tissues by increasing the repopulating capacity of neutrophil progenitors and giving rise to low-granule neutrophils. Human neutrophils that inherited TET2 mutations mount exacerbated inflammatory responses and have more condensed chromatin, which correlates with compact neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production. We expose here physiological abnormalities that may inform future strategies to detect TET2-CH and prevent NET-mediated pathologies associated with CH.","Neurological disorders are the leading cause of physical and cognitive disability across the globe, currently affecting up to 15% of the world population, with the burden of chronic neurodegenerative diseases having doubled over the last 2 decades. Two decades ago, neurologists relying solely on clinical signs and basic imaging faced challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Today, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatic methods is changing this landscape. This paper explores this transformative journey, emphasizing the critical role of AI in neurology, aiming to integrate a multitude of methods and thereby enhance the field of neurology. Over the past 25 years, integrating biomedical data science into medicine, particularly neurology, has fundamentally transformed how we understand, diagnose, and treat neurological diseases. Advances in genomics sequencing, the introduction of new imaging methods, the discovery of novel molecular biomarkers for nervous system function, a comprehensive understanding of immunology and neuroimmunology shaping disease subtypes, and the advent of advanced electrophysiological recording methods, alongside the digitalization of medical records and the rise of AI, all led to an unparalleled surge in data within neurology. In addition, telemedicine and web-based interactive health platforms, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have become integral to neurology practice. The real-world impact of these advancements is evident, with AI-driven analysis of imaging and genetic data leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and more. Neuroinformatics is the key component connecting all these advances. By harnessing the power of IT and computational methods to efficiently organize, analyze, and interpret vast datasets, we can extract meaningful insights from complex neurological data, contributing to a deeper understanding of the intricate workings of the brain. In this paper, we describe the large-scale datasets that have emerged in neurology over the last 25 years and showcase the major advancements made by integrating these datasets with advanced neuroinformatic approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. We further discuss challenges in integrating AI into neurology, including ethical considerations in data use, the need for further personalization of treatment, and embracing new emerging technologies like quantum computing. These developments are shaping a future where neurological care is more precise, accessible, and tailored to individual patient needs. We believe further advancements in AI will bridge traditional medical disciplines and cutting-edge technology, navigating the complexities of neurological data and steering medicine toward a future of more precise, accessible, and patient-centric health care.",0
"Host defense against viral pathogens is an essential function for all living organisms. In cell-intrinsic innate immunity, dedicated sensor proteins recognize molecular signatures of infection and communicate to downstream adaptor or effector proteins to activate immune defense. Remarkably, recent evidence demonstrates that much of the core machinery of innate immunity is shared across eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains of life. Here, we review a pioneering example of evolutionary conservation in innate immunity: the animal cGAS-STING signaling pathway and its ancestor in bacteria, CBASS anti-phage defense. We discuss the unique mechanism by which animal cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) and bacterial CD-NTases in these pathways link pathogen detection with immune activation using nucleotide second messenger signals. Comparing the biochemical, structural, and mechanistic details of cGAS-STING, cGLR signaling, and CBASS, we highlight emerging questions in the field and examine evolutionary pressures that may have shaped the origins of nucleotide second messenger signaling in antiviral defense.","Bacteria encode an arsenal of diverse systems that defend against phage infection. A common theme uniting many prevalent anti-phage defense systems is the use of specialized nucleotide signals that function as second messengers to activate downstream effector proteins and inhibit viral propagation. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms controlling nucleotide immune signaling in four major families of anti-phage defense systems: CBASS, Pycsar, Thoeris, and type III CRISPR immunity. Analysis of the individual steps connecting phage detection, nucleotide signal synthesis, and downstream effector function reveals shared core principles of signaling and uncovers system-specific strategies used to augment immune defense. We compare recently discovered mechanisms used by phages to evade nucleotide immune signaling and highlight convergent strategies that shape host-virus interactions. Finally, we explain how the evolutionary connection between bacterial anti-phage defense and eukaryotic antiviral immunity defines fundamental rules that govern nucleotide-based immunity across all kingdoms of life.",1
"DNA nanostructures have been widely researched in recent years as emerging biomedical materials for drug delivery, biosensing, and cancer therapy, in addition to their hereditary function. Multiple precisely designed single-strand DNAs can be fabricated into complex, three-dimensional DNA nanostructures through a simple self-assembly process. Among all of the synthetic DNA nanostructures, tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) stand out as the most promising biomedical nanomaterial. TDNs possess the merits of structural stability, cell membrane permeability, and natural biocompatibility due to their compact structures and DNA origin. In addition to their inherent advantages, TDNs were shown to have great potential in delivering therapeutic agents through multiple functional modifications. As a multifunctional material, TDNs have enabled innovative pharmaceutical applications, including antimicrobial therapy, anticancer treatment, immune modulation, and cartilage regeneration. Given the rapid development of TDNs in the biomedical field, it is critical to understand how to successfully produce and fine-tune the properties of TDNs for specific therapeutic needs and clinical translation. This article provides insights into the synthesis and functionalization of TDNs and summarizes the approaches for TDN-based therapeutics delivery as well as their broad applications in the field of pharmaceutics and nanomedicine, challenges, and future directions.","Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). This review specifically aims to investigate the role of latent microbial infections-such as those caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Chlamydia pneumoniae, and others-in contributing to myelin and axon damage in MS. Methods: We evaluated recent studies from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases that focus on the relationship between latent microbial infections and MS pathogenesis. Results: In MS, emerging evidence suggests that latent microbial infections play a significant role in triggering and perpetuating the inflammatory processes associated with the disease. The potential mechanisms by which these infections contribute to the pathogenesis of MS, highlighting the interplay between the immune system, microbial agents, and the CNS are evaluated. These include molecular mimicry, where similarities in sequence or structure between viral, bacterial, or self-peptides can activate autoreactive T or B cells through cross activation by pathogen-derived peptides, chronic inflammation triggered by persistent infection, leading to immune-mediated damage, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, allowing microbial agents or immune cells to infiltrate the CNS. Conclusion: This review underscores the critical role of latent microbial infections in MS pathogenesis. By elucidating these mechanisms, we provide new insights that could inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions and preventive strategies for MS.",0
"PurposeAn increasing number of patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are benefiting from immunotherapy. However, the individual immune profile of patients who respond to treatment is unclear. Multiple programmed cell death (PCD) patterns play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells, predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy using a risk model for programmed cell death gene combinations LUSC risk model.MethodsGenes associated with 12 types of PCD were analyzed to establish a prognostic model. Risk scores were calculated using PCDG-based expression profiles, and LUSC patients were classified into two groups. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) characteristics and immunotherapy responses were compared between the two groups. Finally, staging was predicted using the extreme gradient boosting tree algorithm (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), and an algorithmic model was constructed to predict the prognosis of LUSC patients based on the PCDG risk score.ResultsA stepwise downscaling of 1256 PCDGs was performed to screen out 16 genes associated with LUSC prognosis to construct a risk model. Immune cell infiltration levels, the immunotherapy response, and prognostic differences were different between these two groups of patients. The classification prediction model based on the XGBoost algorithm and the prognostic model based on the risk score were able to distinguish the risk subtypes and individual prognosis of LUSC patients, respectively.ConclusionsPCD patterns exert a crucial effect on the development of LUSC. An evaluation of different PCD patterns in LUSC improves the understanding of the characteristics of infiltrating immune cells and mutational features of the TIME, distinguishes LUSC patients who might benefit from immunotherapy, and predicts their future survival.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04789-w.","BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare solid malignancy with a poor prognosis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in tumorigenesis and progression. However, little is known about the role of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC.Methodsm6A-related lncRNAs were extracted by Pearson analysis, and then prognosis-related lncRNAs were filtered from the m6A-related lncRNAs by univariate Cox regression analysis. Based on the expression patterns of the prognosis-related lncRNAs, samples were classified into distinct clusters. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used to construct a m6A-lncRNA-related prognostic signature for PC patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate the prognostic ability of the model.ResultsA total of 178 tumor and 4 normal samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database in our study. Based on the expression of 12 filtered prognosis-related lncRNAs, two distinct clusters were eventually identified; these clusters were characterized by differences in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and prognosis. A risk model comprising ten m6A-related lncRNAs was identified as an independent predictor of prognosis. ROC analysis revealed that this model had an acceptable prognostic value for PC patients. The prognostic signature was related to the TIME and the expression of critical immune checkpoint molecules.ConclusionThis study comprehensively assessed the expression pattern and prognostic value of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC. The different clusters correlated with distinct TIMEs and prognoses. The study also constructed a ten-gene signature prognostic model based on m6A-related lncRNAs, which showed good accuracy in predicting overall survival.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03985-4.",1
"BackgroundMesothelioma (MESO) is an insidious malignancy with a complex diagnosis and a poor prognosis. Our study unveils Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase 2 (GFPT2) as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic marker for MESO, exploring its role in MESO pathogenesis.MethodsWe utilised tissue samples and clinicopathologic data to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of GFPT2 as a biomarker for MESO. The role of GFPT2 in the malignant progression of MESO was investigated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The activation of NF-κB-p65 through O-GlcNAcylation at Ser75 was elucidated using experiments like HPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and mass spectrometry analysis.ResultsThe study demonstrates that GFPT2 exhibits a sensitivity of 92.60% in diagnosing MESO. Overexpression of it has been linked to an unfavourable prognosis. Through rigorous verification, we have confirmed that elevated GFPT2 levels drive malignant proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in MESO. At the molecular level, GFPT2 augments p65 O-GlcNAcylation, orchestrating its nuclear translocation and activating the NF-κB signalling pathway.ConclusionsOur insights suggest GFPT2’s potential as a distinctive biomarker for MESO diagnosis and prognosis, and as an innovative therapeutic target, offering a new horizon for identification and treatment strategies in MESO management.","Pineal-region tumors are a histologically heterogeneous group of tumors and represent a rare occurrence, accounting for less than 1% of all adult intracranial tumors. Among these, primary pineal malignant melanomas (PPM) represent an even rarer entity, with only twenty-five cases being reported in the literature to date. We present the case of a 65-year-old patient who presented in our department for progressive headache, gait disturbance and memory impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a solid mass in pineal region, measuring 2.2 × 1.2 × 2.0 cm and causing obstructive hydrocephalus. He underwent a third ventriculostomy, but we failed to obtain a sample for diagnostic purposes. The intraoperative surprise was the presence, at the level of the third ventricle, of multiple melanin deposits, which were not picked up by the MRI. Although the biopsy could not be performed and had to be obtained by stereotactic biopsy in a second intervention, the endoscopy findings allowed for the correct staging of the intracranial disease and appropriate treatment management.",0
"BackgroundThe incidence of lung cancer tends to be younger, and adenocarcinoma is the main histological type. Even patients with the same tumor type may have significant differences in clinical features, tumor microenvironment and genomic background at different ages. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, differences in ICI efficacy between older and younger patients are unknown. Our study aimed to explore the relationship between age and immunotherapy in LUAD.MethodsIn our study, 1313 resected LUAD patients in our hospital were divided into young (age ≤ 50) and old groups (age > 50), and the clinical characteristic differences between them were analyzed. Of these, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on the 311 cases. In addition, immune-related signatures of 508 LUAD patients were analyzed by TCGA RNA expression data. Then, we validated genomic and clinical information of 270 LUAD samples in the MSKCC cohort.ResultsERBB2 and EGFR gene mutations were significantly different between the two groups, and the gene mutation number in the old group was significantly higher than that in the young group. In addition, immune-related signatures of LUAD patients were analyzed by TCGA RNA expression data, which indicated that the patients in the old group might have a better immune microenvironment. Then, we validated the MSKCC cohort and found that the TMB of the old group was significantly higher than that of the young group, and the OS of immunotherapy was longer in the old group.ConclusionOur study was the first to analyze the differences in the genomic landscape and immune-related biomarkers between the young and old groups of LUAD patients and found that the old group had a better efficacy of immunotherapy, providing a reference for the study design and treatment of patients with LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04195-8.","PurposeThe combination of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors has a good efficacy in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). The multi-target TKI lenvatinib and NGS-guided targeted therapy are also promising in BTC treatment. This study aimed to explore the performance of GemOX plus sintilimab and TKI (either lenvatinib or by NGS-guided targeted therapy) for local advanced or metastatic BTCs.MethodsThis prospective single-arm study included patients with local advanced or metastatic BTCs and applied intravenous infusion of standard GemOX plus sintilimab and lenvatinib (no targetable gene alterations) or targeted therapy based on NGS (olaparib for BRCA1/2 mutation, dasatinib for IDH1/2 mutation, afatinib for EGFR amplification, lenvatinib for PDGFR and KIT mutation, and lenvatinib for FGFR/KIT mutation).ResultsFrom November 2020 to December 2021, 22 patients BTCs (6 GBC, 14 iCCA, 1 pCCA and 1 dCCA cases) were enrolled, with an average age of 58.4 years. Partial response (PR) was achieved in 10 cases, stable disease (SD) in 9 cases and progression disease (PD) in 3 cases (13.6%). The objective response rate (ORR) was 45.5%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 86.4%. During the treatment, the incidence of adverse reactions was 81.8%, and the incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was 9.09%. For 14 patients with NGS, 5 patients were treated by targeted therapy and there were 1 SD and 4 PR cases. For four patients with positive PD-L1 expression, the ORR was 100%. While among the three patients with super-progression markers such as RET, MDM2 and FGF14/STK24, there were two SD and one PD cases.ConclusionIn patients with advanced BTCs, the combination of GemOX plus sintilimab and lenvatinib or NGS-guided targeted therapy showed promising ORR and DCR, especially for the patients with positive PD-L1 expression and targetable gene alterations.",1
"Little is known about the mutational landscape of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and predictive biomarkers of response to systemic therapies are lacking. We aimed to describe the mutational landscape of advanced HCC and to identify predictors of primary resistance to systemic therapies using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). We prospectively enrolled 121 patients between October 2015 and January 2019. We performed targeted ultra-deep sequencing of 25 genes and Digital Droplet PCR of TERT promoter, including sequential samples throughout treatment. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) stratified by mutation profiles in ctDNA. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and objective response rate. The most frequent mutations in ctDNA of advanced HCC were TERT promoter (51%), TP53 (32%), CTNNB1 (17%), PTEN (8%), AXIN1, ARID2, KMT2D, and TSC2 (each 6%). TP53 and CTNNB1 mutations were mutually exclusive. Patients with mutations in the PI3K/MTOR pathway had significantly shorter PFS than those without these mutations after tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2.1 vs 3.7 months, p < 0.001), but not after immune checkpoint inhibition (CPI). WNT pathway mutations were not associated with PFS, overall survival, or objective response after CPI. Serial profiling of ctDNA in a subset correlated with treatment response. Mutation profiling of ctDNA in advanced HCC shows similar mutation frequencies for known HCC drivers compared to early stages and identifies predictive biomarkers of response to systemic therapies.","BackgroundNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome with a birth prevalence of approximately 1 in 2000–3000 individuals. Management of both benign and malignant tumors arising in individuals with NF1 is demanding and tumors may be difficult to treat. Both standardized and individual surveillance programs are therefore highly important to prevent morbidity and mortality in patients with NF1.MethodsThe guidelines for the clinical management of NF1 recently proposed by the European Reference Network for Genetic Tumor Risk Syndromes provide the cornerstone of the present surveillance form and were discussed through three rounds of voting and a final consensus meeting involving experts from five Austrian and one German clinical NF1 centers for adults and one patient organization representative. Subsequently, 31 items within 4 categories were integrated into the proposed surveillance form for Austria. All recommendations, unless otherwise specified, pertain to primarily asymptomatic patients in routine follow-up.RecommendationsAt healthcare transition from pediatric to adult surveillance or the initial visit in adulthood, we suggest a thorough clinical, laboratory and radiological examination to obtain a baseline for future diagnostics. To comply with the general screening recommendations in Austria, we suggest extending the frequency of clinical visits from annual to biennial at 50 years of age. In cases of clinical dynamics, early follow-up is recommended to facilitate early detection of potential complications. Particular emphasis should be placed on preventive patient education.Supplementary InformationThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00508-024-02443-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"AbstractRationaleHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.Eligibility criteriaParallel‐group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross‐over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi‐randomised trials for analysis.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non‐serious.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta‐analysed the outcome data at the longest follow‐up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random‐effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.Included studiesWe included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single‐centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia‐Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co‐interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information.The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow‐up was three months to five years.Synthesis of resultsTen trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions.Eight trials evaluated all‐cause mortality at varied follow‐up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow‐up periods taken together.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one‐year follow‐up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events.One trial measured health‐related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow‐up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health‐related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health‐related quality of life scores. No further data were provided.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non‐serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non‐serious.We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.We identified no ongoing trials.Authors' conclusionsBased on the low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all‐cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events considered non‐serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationProtocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014869.","AbstractBackgroundBisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor‐kappa B ligand (RANKL)‐inhibitors are amongst the bone‐modifying agents used as supportive treatment in women with breast cancer who do not have bone metastases. These agents aim to reduce bone loss and the risk of fractures. Bisphosphonates have demonstrated survival benefits, particularly in postmenopausal women.ObjectivesTo assess and compare the effects of different bone‐modifying agents as supportive treatment to reduce bone mineral density loss and osteoporotic fractures in women with breast cancer without bone metastases and generate a ranking of treatment options using network meta‐analyses (NMAs).Search methodsWe identified studies by electronically searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase until January 2023. We searched various trial registries and screened abstracts of conference proceedings and reference lists of identified trials.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials comparing different bisphosphonates and RANKL‐inihibitors with each other or against no further treatment or placebo for women with breast cancer without bone metastases.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Outcomes were bone mineral density, quality of life, overall fractures, overall survival and adverse events. We conducted NMAs and generated treatment rankings.Main resultsForty‐seven trials (35,163 participants) fulfilled our inclusion criteria; 34 trials (33,793 participants) could be considered in the NMA (8 different treatment options).Bone mineral densityWe estimated that the bone mineral density of participants with no treatment/placebo measured as total T‐score was ‐1.34. Evidence from the NMA (9 trials; 1166 participants) suggests that treatment with ibandronate (T‐score ‐0.77; MD 0.57, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 1.19) may slightly increase bone mineral density (low certainty) and treatment with zoledronic acid (T‐score ‐0.45; MD 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.16) probably slightly increases bone mineral density compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Risedronate (T‐score ‐1.08; MD 0.26, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.84) may result in little to no difference compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty). We are uncertain whether alendronate (T‐score 2.36; MD 3.70, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 9.41) increases bone mineral density compared to no treatment/placebo (very low certainty).Quality of lifeNo quantitative analyses could be performed for quality of life, as only three studies reported this outcome. All three studies showed only minimal differences between the respective interventions examined.Overall fracture rateWe estimated that 70 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo had fractures. Evidence from the NMA (16 trials; 19,492 participants) indicates that treatment with clodronate or ibandronate (42 of 1000; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.92; 40 of 1000; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.86, respectively) decreases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (high certainty). Denosumab or zoledronic acid (51 of 1000; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.01; 55 of 1000; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11, respectively) probably slightly decreases the number of fractures; and risedronate (39 of 1000; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.16) probably decreases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Pamidronate (106 of 1000; RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.06) probably increases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty).Overall survivalWe estimated that 920 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo survived overall. Evidence from the NMA (17 trials; 30,991 participants) suggests that clodronate (924 of 1000; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17), denosumab (927 of 1000; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.21), ibandronate (915 of 1000; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.34) and zoledronic acid (925 of 1000; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.14) may result in little to no difference regarding overall survival compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty). Additionally, we are uncertain whether pamidronate (905 of 1000; HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.78) decreases overall survival compared to no treatment/placebo (very low certainty).Osteonecrosis of the jawWe estimated that 1 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo developed osteonecrosis of the jaw. Evidence from the NMA (12 trials; 23,527 participants) suggests that denosumab (25 of 1000; RR 24.70, 95% CI 9.56 to 63.83), ibandronate (6 of 1000; RR 5.77, 95% CI 2.04 to 16.35) and zoledronic acid (9 of 1000; RR 9.41, 95% CI 3.54 to 24.99) probably increases the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Additionally, clodronate (3 of 1000; RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.83 to 8.50) may increase the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty).Renal impairmentWe estimated that 14 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo developed renal impairment. Evidence from the NMA (12 trials; 22,469 participants) suggests that ibandronate (28 of 1000; RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.88) probably increases the occurrence of renal impairment compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Zoledronic acid (21 of 1000; RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.58) probably increases the occurrence of renal impairment while clodronate (12 of 1000; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39) and denosumab (11 of 1000; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.19) probably results in little to no difference regarding the occurrence of renal impairment compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty).Authors' conclusionsWhen considering bone‐modifying agents for managing bone loss in women with early or locally advanced breast cancer, one has to balance between efficacy and safety. Our findings suggest that bisphosphonates (excluding alendronate and pamidronate) or denosumab compared to no treatment or placebo likely results in increased bone mineral density and reduced fracture rates. Our survival analysis that included pre and postmenopausal women showed little to no difference regarding overall survival. These treatments may lead to more adverse events. Therefore, forming an overall judgement of the best ranked bone‐modifying agent is challenging. More head‐to‐head comparisons, especially comparing denosumab with any bisphosphonate, are needed to address gaps and validate the findings of this review.",1
"Cancer immunotherapy has made great progress in effectively attacking or eliminating cancer. However, the challenges posed by the low reactivity of some solid tumors still remain. Macrophages, as a key component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), play an important role in determining the progression of solid tumors due to their plasticity and heterogeneity. Targeting and reprogramming macrophages in TME to desired phenotypes offers an innovative and promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. Meanwhile, the rapid development of in vivo molecular imaging techniques provides us with powerful tools to study macrophages. In this review, we summarize the current progress in macrophage reprogramming from conceptual roadmaps to therapeutic approaches, including monoclonal antibody drugs, small molecule drugs, gene therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor-engineered macrophages (CAR-M). More importantly, we highlight the significance of molecular imaging in observing and understanding the process of macrophage reprogramming during cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we introduce the therapeutic applications of imaging and reprogramming macrophages in three solid tumors. In the future, the integration of molecular imaging into the development of novel macrophage reprogramming strategies holds great promise for precise clinical cancer immunotherapy.",ABSTRACTLatest developments in the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine compiled from publicly available information and press releases from non-academic institutions in June 2024.,0
"KRAS mutations play a critical role in the development and progression of several cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Despite advancements in targeted therapies, the management of KRAS-mutant tumors remains challenging. This study leverages bibliometric analysis and a comprehensive review of clinical trials to identify emerging immunotherapies and potential treatments for KRAS-related cancers. Using the Web of Science Core Collection and Citespace, we analyzed publications from January 2008 to March 2023 alongside 52 clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO’s registry, concentrating on immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) and novel therapies. Our study highlights an increased focus on the tumor immune microenvironment and precision therapy. Clinical trials reveal the effectiveness of ICBs and the promising potential of T-cell receptor T-cell therapy and vaccines in treating KRAS-mutant cancers. ICBs, particularly in combination therapies, stand out in managing KRAS-mutant tumors. Identifying the tumor microenvironment and gene co-mutation profiles as key research areas, our findings advocate for multidisciplinary approaches to advance personalized cancer treatment. Future research should integrate genetic, immunological, and computational studies to unveil new therapeutic targets and refine treatment strategies for KRAS-mutant cancers.","Background: Aspergillus has become the second most common causative agent of invasive fungal infections and is the leading cause of death from fungal infections. Methods: English-language publications ranging from 1975 to 2022 collected from the Web of Science Core Collection database were analyzed visually using VOSviewer, R package Bibliometrix, Scimago graphic, Gephi, Pajek, and Microsoft Excel 365. Literature search using the advanced search function in WoSCC with the search formula “TS=(Aspergillus).” The inclusion criteria were as follows:  article type = article;  time span = 1975–2022;  topic = “Medical Mycology”;  research field = “Respiratory System, Internal Medicine”;  language type = English. Results: As of February 21, 2023, studies of Aspergillus in respiratory medicine included 1065 articles with 41,308 cumulative citations. The United States ranked first in terms of the highest number of publications (n = 320). Udice French Research University was the institution with the highest number of publications (n = 40). The author with the highest number of publications was Denning (n = 32). Based on the CiteSpace analysis result, the keywords with the nature of a Burst Citation were “epidemiology,” “chronic pulmonary aspergillosis,” “galactomannan,” “guideline,” “sensitization,” and “randomized trail.” Besides the keywords, it was found that as of 2022, only the topics “allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis” and “invasive pulmonary aspergillosis” are still active with a large number of papers published, according to the results of the CiteSpace analysis of the cited literature. Conclusions: The bibliometric results indicated the current hot research hotspots of Aspergillus were as follows:  research directly related to Aspergillus (epidemiology, risk factors, early diagnosis methods, and methods of novel antifungal treatment, for example, galactomannan);  studying coinfections of Aspergillus with other pathogens: For example, COVID-19 could focus on studying the immune status of patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) to guide individualized immunotherapy and individualized management of patients with CAPA.",1
"Purpose:This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in hereditary cancer genes utilizing a universal testing approach and to determine the rate of PGVs that would have been missed based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines in genitourinary (GU) malignancies.Materials and Methods:A multisite, single-institution prospective germline genetic test (GGT) was universally offered to patients with new or active diagnoses of GU malignancies (prostate, bladder, and renal) from April 2018 to March 2020 at Mayo Clinic sites. Participants were offered GGT using a next-generation sequencing panel of > 80 genes. Demographic, tumor characteristics, and genetic results were evaluated. NCCN GU cancer guidelines were used to identify whether patients had incremental findings, defined as PGV-positive patients who would not have received testing based on NCCN guidelines.Results:Of 3095 individuals enrolled in the study, 601 patients had GU cancer (prostate = 358, bladder = 106, and renal = 137). The mean enrollment age was 67 years (SD 9.1), 89% were male, and 86% of patients were non-Hispanic White. PGVs were identified in 82 (14%) of all GU patients. PGV prevalence breakdown by cancer type was: 14% prostate, 14% bladder, and 13% renal cancer. Nearly one-third of identified PGVs were high penetrance, and the majority of these (67%) were clinically actionable. Incremental PGVs were identified in 28 (57%) prostate, 15 (100%) bladder, and 14 (78%) renal cancer patients. Of the 82 patients with PGV findings, 29 (35%) had at least 1 relative undergo cascade testing for the familial variant(s) identified.Conclusions:More than 1 in 8 patients with GU malignancies were found to carry a PGV, with 67% of patients with high-penetrance PGVs undergoing clinically actionable changes. The majority of these PGVs would not have been identified based on current testing criteria. These findings support universal GGT for GU malignancies and underscore its potential to enhance risk assessment and guide precision interventions in urologic oncology.","Purpose Tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) mutations are common in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We evaluated their clinical impact in patients treated with targeted agents or immunotherapy in the KCSG HN15-16 TRIUMPH trial.Materials and Methods We analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with TP53 mutations in the TRIUMPH trial, a multicenter, biomarker-driven umbrella trial in Korea. Patients were assigned to treatment groups based on genomic profiles: group 1, alpelisib; group 2, poziotinib; group 3, nintedanib; and group 4, abemaciclib. If there was no identifiable target, the patients were allocated to group 5 (durvalumab±tremelimumab).Results TP53 mutations were detected in 116/179 patients (64.8%), more frequently in human papillomavirus–negative and non-oropharyngeal cancers. Patients with TP53 mutations exhibited shorter progression-free survival than TP53 wild-type in all the patients (1.7 vs. 3.8 months, p=0.002) and in those who received targeted treatments (2.5 vs. 7.3 months, p=0.009). Furthermore, TP53 mutations were strongly associated with poor overall survival than TP53 wild-type in all the patients (11.1 vs. 28.8 months, p=0.005) and in group 5 (8.1 vs. 33.0 months, p=0.001).Conclusion TP53 mutations were associated with aggressive clinical characteristics and poor survival, particularly in HNSCC patients treated with immunotherapy.",0
"PurposeCervical cancer (CC) patients are more likely to develop second primary malignancies (SPMs) than general population. With the advancement in cancer therapy, CC patients are achieving long-term survival, leading SPMs to our attention. Our study aims to establish diagnostic and prognostic nomograms for CC patients with second primary malignancies (CCSPMs) to help make personalized follow-up plans and treatments.MethodsData of CCSPMs between 2000 and 2019 was extracted from SEER. The proportions and the median interval time of CCSPM onset were calculated. 11 related clinical characteristics, including age, race, marital status, grade, FIGO stage, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, were further explore. Logistic and Cox regressions were employed to predict risk factors for CCSPMs diagnosis. Finally, two nomograms were developed to predict the probability occurrence and prognosis of CCSPMs, respectively.ResultsFor diagnostic nomogram construction, 59,178 CC patients were randomly divided into training (n = 41,426) and validation cohorts (n = 17,752). For prognostic nomogram construction, 3527 CCSPMs patients were randomly divided into training (n = 2469) and validation cohorts (n = 1058). The diagnostic nomogram consisting of above 11 independent risk factors (all P < 0.05), had high accuracy (AUCtraining = 0.851 and AUCvalidating = 0.845). The prognostic nomogram integrated with eight independent prognostic factors such as treatments, FIGO stage and TNM stage performed well in predicting 5-year OS (AUCtraining = 0.835 and AUCvalidating = 0.837).ConclusionOur diagnostic and prognostic nomograms could facilitate clinicians to quantify individual SPMs risk and survival probabilities and optimize the surveillance recommendations and personalized clinical decision-making.","PurposeThe risk factors and clinical characteristics of ICI-induced immune-mediated hepatotoxicity (IMH) are not fully understood. Thus, the present study sought to clarify the clinical features of IMH.MethodsAll patients treated with ICIs between September 2014 and April 2019 at our institution were included. Clinical data were retrospectively collected from medical records. The frequency of grade ≥ 2 liver damage, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for developing IMH were examined.ResultsOverall, 250 patients (median age 71 years; range 30–87 years; 202 males and 48 females) were included in the analyses. Forty-five patients had elevated transaminase levels (> threefold the upper limit of normal). Of these, 21 were considered to have IMH. The remaining 24 patients had other causes of elevated transaminase levels. Steroids were administered to 13/21 patients with IMH. Although all patients exhibited improvement, IMH was not associated with the anticancer efficacy of the ICIs or OS. A multivariable analysis revealed that IMH was significantly associated with malignant melanoma (odds ratio [OR] 11.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5–38.0; P = 0.0002) and ipilimumab–nivolumab combination therapy (OR 61.2; 95% CI 7.9–1275.3; P < 0.0001).ConclusionImmune-mediated hepatotoxicity occurred in 9.5% of patients treated with ICIs. Appropriate therapeutic interventions are important to avoid affecting the patient’s prognosis, and accurate diagnosis of IMH is essential for this purpose. The frequency of IMH varied according to the type of cancer and the drug used, and was significantly higher in patients with malignant melanoma and in patients given ipilimumab–nivolumab combination therapy.",1
"ABSTRACTRegenerative therapy, a key area of tissue engineering, holds promise for restoring damaged organs, especially in bone regeneration. Bone healing is natural to the body but becomes complex under stress and disease. Large bone deformities pose significant challenges in tissue engineering. Among various methods, scaffolds are attractive as they provide structural support and essential nutrients for cell adhesion and growth. Collagen and hydroxyapatite (HA) are widely used due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Collagen and nano-scale HA enhance cell adhesion and development. Thus, nano HA/collagen scaffolds offer potential solutions for bone regeneration. This review focuses on the use and production of nano-sized HA/collagen composites in bone regeneration.","AbstractIFNγ is a cytokine with both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects and its role in glioma immunotherapy resistance is not well understood. In the tumor microenvironment, T and NK cells produce IFNγ, which affects cellular phenotypes in most of the cancer and stromal cells since IFNγ receptor is ubiquitously expressed. IFNγ induces expression of molecules that confer resistance to immunotherapies, such as PDL1, PDL2, IDO1, and iNOS. The goal of this study is to elucidate cell type-specific responses to IFNγ in immune competent glioma models we developed that are resistant to immunotherapy. We intracranially injected male and female murine glioma cells into B6 and Ifng-/- honst mice to measure overall survival and perform immune phenotyping and single cell RNA-sequencing analyses. Ifnγ-/- hosts exhibited a shorter survival, and the proportion of GBM cells is higher in Ifng-/- hosts compared to wild type, indicating that the net effect of IFNγ signaling in glioma is anti-tumorigenic. In a recent study, we published that IFNγ-response pathway is enriched in the mesenchymal-like (MES-like) subtype of human GBM cells, compared to neutral-progenitor-like (NPC-like) and oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like (OPC-like) cells (Abdelfattah and others, 2022). To test our hypothesis that IFNγ signaling induces MES transition in glioma cells in vivo, we compared fractions of glioma cell subtypes in wildtype and Ifng-/- male and female hosts. In female Ifng-/- mice, MES-like GBM cell fraction was reduced while OPC-like fraction was increased, supporting our hypothesis. However, there was no difference in male hosts. Furthermore, gliomas grown in female B6 hosts showed higher infiltration of immune cells (CD45+), lymphocytes (CD3+) and fewer resident microglia cells (CD11b+CD45int), compared with Ifng-/- female hosts. In contrast, no significant difference in immune cell infiltration was observed between B6 vs Ifng-/- males. These results suggest an unanticipated and complex context-dependent role of IFNγ signaling in GBM, which include sex differences in its role in immune cell recruitment and MES transition in glioma cells.",0
"IntroductionImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and has generated remarkable clinical results against multiple malignancies. Exploration of new technical approaches to further boost the therapeutic efficacy of ICB is of potential medical importance. In this study, we designed a novel nanotherapeutics for ICB immunotherapy.MethodsCTLA-4 aptamers were conjugated to the surface of albumin nanoparticle to construct an aptamer-modified nanostructure (Apt-NP). To improve ICB efficacy, fexofenadine (FEXO), an antihistamine, was encapsulated into Apt-NP to make a drug-loaded nanoparticle (Apt-NP-FEXO). The antitumor efficacies of Apt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsApt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO had average diameters of 149 nm and 159 nm, respectively. Similar to free CTLA-4 aptamers, Apt-modified NPs could selectively bind with CTLA-4 positive cells and improve lymphocyte-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity in vitro. In animal studies, compared with free CTLA-4 aptamer, Apt-NP significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Moreover, Apt-NP-FEXO further improved antitumor efficacy vs. Apt-NP in vivo.ConclusionThe results suggest that Apt-NP-FEXO represents a novel strategy to improve ICB outcome and may have application potential in cancer immunotherapy.","PurposeAlthough immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to be effective in many clinical trials, real-world data remain limited. We investigated the outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received nivolumab, with an emphasis on hyper-progressive disease (HPD).MethodsThis retrospective study enrolled stage IV NSCLC patients who received nivolumab after progression on prior chemotherapy between July 2016 and June 2018 at a single center in Korea. HPD was defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors as progression at the first evaluation, with a ≥ two-fold increase in the tumor growth rate during nivolumab treatment.ResultsA total of 83 patients with a median age of 60 years were enrolled [squamous, 25(30%) and non-squamous, 58(70%)]. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82–4.31] and 8.6 months (95% CI 5.56–11.59), respectively. HPD developed in 16 (19.2%). The median OS of HPD patients was 2.2 months (95% CI 0.92–3.75) compared with 4.1 months for progressive disease (PD) patients without HPD (95% CI 1.54–6.67). Among patients with pleura or pericardium metastasis, increased effusion was seen more frequently in HPD patients compared with PD patients without HPD [90% (9/10) vs. 28.6% (4/14); p = 0.005]. HPD patients also showed a significant decrease in circulating albumin after treatment with nivolumab (p = 0.030).ConclusionAlthough the efficacy of nivolumab in real-world patients was comparable to that seen in clinical trials, clinicians should be aware of HPD because it is not uncommon and represents a worse prognosis.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03293-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundEGFR exon 20 insertion (EGFR ex20ins) mutations account for about 10–12% of all EGFR-mutated tumors, which are usually associated with primary drug resistance to conventional EGFR-TKI therapy and worse survival outcomes, and are currently a major problem for clinicians in clinical management. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of sequencing technology and careful review of clinical data, investigators have gained a deeper understanding and clearer cognition of the clinicopathological features and molecular mechanisms of these EGFR ex20ins mutations.PurposeThe aim of this study was to systemically review the molecular structure and clinical characteristics of EGFR ex20ins mutations, and focus on summarizing the latest data of emerging therapies (including novel small-molecule EGFR-TKI drugs, specific monoclonal antibodies, novel drugs targeting other mechanisms, and immunotherapy) for those patients.ConclusionAdvances in overcoming these systemic challenges have greatly accelerated the development of new drugs targeting EGFR ex20ins, and are committed to designing more rational combination therapies to overcome or delay the emergence of drug resistance, ultimately improve the prognosis of such uncommon mutant populations.",1
"AbstractCytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an uncommon but deadly side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are presently an increasingly important therapy option for malignant tumors, but there are limited treatments available for CRS. We present a case of a 72-year-old man who received one cycle of ICI coupled with cisplatin and albumin-binding paclitaxel therapy for a locally advanced right lung adenocarcinoma. Following an abrupt onset of dyspnea, the patient underwent a quick physical examination, blood tests and was diagnosed with CRS. After prompt initiation of glucocorticoid pulse treatment, the symptoms relieved. The case illustrates the management of severe CRS following ICI therapy while highlighting the uncommon and potentially fatal immune-related side effects.","Aim: Studies on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related potential neurological adverse events (pNAEs) in Korean lung cancer (LC) patients are scarce. We aimed to examine ICI prescription trends from 2018 to 2022, patient characteristics and factors associated with ICI prescription or concurrent pNAEs in LC.Research design & methods: This observational, cross-sectional study of Korean LC patients investigated four ICIs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab). The annual ICI prescription rate was calculated by dividing the number of LC patients prescribed ICIs with the total annual number of LC patients. Factors associated with ICI prescriptions or concurrent pNAEs were assessed.Results: The annual ICI prescription rate increased from 3.29% to 9.74% (average: 6.20%). Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were associated with more ICI prescriptions (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.08). Targeted therapy was associated with fewer prescriptions (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.41–0.49). The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) prescription rate was higher in patients with concurrent pNAEs than those without pNAEs (53.09% vs. 50.84%), and this was associated with higher pNAEs prevalence (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03–1.18).Conclusion: ICI prescription for LC has increased in Korea, CCI and anti-PD-1 increased pNAEs prevalence.",1
"Head and neck cancers (HNC) are aggressive, difficult-to-treat tumors that can be caused by genetic factors but mainly by lifestyle or infection caused by the human papillomavirus. As the sixth most common malignancy, it presents a formidable therapeutic challenge with limited therapeutic modalities. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is appearing as a promising multitarget anticancer and antimetastatic agent. Numerous studies have shown that curcumin and its derivatives have the potential to affect signaling pathways (NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and EGFR) and molecular mechanisms that are crucial for the growth and migration of head and neck tumors. Furthermore, its ability to interact with the tumor microenvironment and trigger the immune system may significantly influence the organism’s immune response to the tumor. Combining curcumin with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy may improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the side effects of treatment, thereby increasing its therapeutic potential. This review is a comprehensive overview that discusses both the benefits and limitations of curcumin and its therapeutic effects in the context of tumor biology, with an emphasis on molecular mechanisms in the context of HNC. This review also includes possibilities to improve the limiting properties of curcumin both in terms of the development of new derivatives, formulations, or combinations with conventional therapies that have potential as a new type of therapy for the treatment of HNC and subsequent use in clinical practice.","We present a case of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with metastasis to the right ventricle (RV) successfully treated through surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). A 50-year-old woman presented with dyspnea, prompting transthoracic echocardiography that revealed a mobile, irregular RV mass measuring 40 × 32 mm. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed masses in the RV and the right pulmonary artery, which was totally occluded. Emergency surgical resection of both masses was performed to avoid sudden death. Histopathological analysis confirmed squamous cell carcinoma; however, the primary origin of the masses remained unidentified despite extensive evaluations, including positron emission tomography-CT. The final diagnosis was SCCUP. Immunohistochemistry indicated positive programmed cell death ligand 1, and postoperative chemotherapy with an ICI was administered. One year post-surgery, the patient remains healthy with no sign of recurrence.Learning objectiveThis case shows the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) with cardiac metastasis through emergency surgery and postoperative immunotherapy. Despite the poor prognosis associated with cardiac metastatic malignant tumors and the lack of established treatment guidelines, this case highlights the potential benefits of surgical intervention and the efficacy of immunotherapy in managing cardiac metastatic SCCUP, with the patient remaining with no recurrence one-year post-surgery.",0
Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text,"Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of radiotherapy (RT)-related lymphopenia, its predictors, and association with survival in unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) treated with hypofractionated-RT (HF-RT).Methods:Retrospective analysis of 96 patients with unresectable ICC who underwent HF-RT (median 58.05 Gy in 15 fractions) between 2009–2022 was performed. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) nadir within 12 weeks of RT was analyzed. Primary variable of interest was severe lymphopenia, defined as Grade 3+ (ALC <0.5 k/μl) per CTCAE v5.0. Primary outcome of interest was overall survival (OS) from RT.Results:Median follow-up was 16 months. 52% of patients had chemotherapy pre-RT, 23% during RT, and 40% post-RT. Pre-RT, median ALC was 1.1 k/μl and 5% had severe lymphopenia. Post-RT, 68% developed RT-related severe lymphopenia. Patients who developed severe lymphopenia had a significantly lower pre-RT ALC (median 1.1 vs 1.5 k/μl, p=0.01) and larger target tumor volume (median 125 vs 62 cc, p=0.02). In our multivariable Cox model, severe lymphopenia was associated with a 1.7-fold increased risk of death (p=0.04); 1-year OS rates were 63% vs 77% (p=0.03). Receipt of photon vs proton-based RT (OR=3.50, p=0.02), higher mean liver dose (OR=1.19, p<0.01), and longer RT duration (OR=1.49, p=0.02) predicted severe lymphopenia.Conclusion:HF-RT related lymphopenia is an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with unresectable ICC. Patients with lower baseline ALC and larger tumor volume may be at increased risk, and use of proton therapy, minimizing mean liver dose, and avoiding treatment breaks may reduce RT-related lymphopenia.",1
"ABSTRACTPatients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have very poor long-term outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can potentially cure some of these patients who are able to achieve a second or greater remission with salvage chemotherapy. Unfortunately, several barriers exist to transplantation and not all patients with r/r AML are able to proceed to allo-SCT. Therefore, novel therapies to decrease the risk of relapse in these patients are urgently needed. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein has emerged as an encouraging vaccine target in AML due to its overexpression in leukemic blast cells and near absence in normal hematopoietic cells. Maintenance therapy with galinpepimut-S, a multivalent heteroclitic WT1 peptide vaccine, holds promise in early phase trials, in patients with AML by inducing a strong innate immune response against the WT1 antigen, leading to the design of this international, open-label, randomized clinical trial, named REGAL. Clinical trial registration:  The clinical trial identifier is NCT04229979.","Despite the use of various therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T), the prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still generally poor. However, immunotherapy is currently a hot topic in the treatment of hematological tumors. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) via CD39, and ADP can be converted to adenosine via CD73, which can bind to P1 and P2 receptors to exert immunomodulatory effects. Research on the mechanism of the purinergic signaling pathway can provide a new direction for the treatment of AML, and inhibitors of this signaling pathway have been discovered by several researchers and gradually applied in the clinic. In this paper, the mechanism of the purinergic signaling pathway and its clinical application are described, revealing a new target for the treatment of AML and subsequent improvement in patient prognosis.",1
"PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant patients with CRC using a large population-based database.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2009 to 2019. Pregnant patients with and without CRC were compared for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, maternal and perinatal outcomes, and hospital burden.ResultsThe study included 306 pregnancies with CRC and 40,887,353 pregnancies without CRC. Pregnant patients with CRC were older and more likely to be White. A significant association was observed between CRC and a history of inflammatory bowel disease or a family history of gastrointestinal cancer. Pregnant patients with CRC had higher odds of maternal death (AOR 260.99, 95% CI 33.36–2041.64), cardiac arrhythmia (AOR 13.73, 95% CI 4.21–44.76), acute kidney injury (AOR 32.6, 95% CI 5.29–200.77), severe sepsis (AOR 163.98, 95% CI 22.05–1219.65), and respiratory failure (AOR 31.67, 95% CI 4.11–243.98). Furthermore, the CRC group experienced higher odds of cesarean section (AOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05–3.03), preterm birth (AOR 4.16, 95% CI 2.05–8.47), and intrauterine death (AOR 13.18, 95% CI 3.33–52.16). Distinct differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes were observed based on the location of CRC. Pregnant patients with CRC faced higher hospital charges and had longer hospital stays during delivery hospitalization compared to those without CRC.ConclusionPregnant patients with CRC are at increased risk for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, emphasizing the importance of early detection, timely intervention, and comprehensive management during pregnancy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05248-2.","ObjectivesThis study aimed to compare the efficacy of local excision (LE) and intersphincteric resection (ISR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieved a significant or complete pathological response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients with stage ypT0-1ycN0 low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy who underwent LE or ISR between June 2016 and June 2021. Baseline characteristics, short-term outcomes, long-term oncological outcomes, and functional outcomes, were compared between the two groups. To reduce the selection bias, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was performed.ResultsThis study included 106 patients (LE group: n = 51, ISR group: n = 55). There were significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (P < 0.05). After IPTW, there were almost no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. The LE group showed less postoperative complications and better function outcomes compared to the ISR group. The LE group had significantly lower rates of complications (13.7% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.014). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of long-term oncological outcomes.ConclusionsFor patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer achieving significant or complete pathological response after neoadjuvant therapy, both LE and ISR present comparable oncological outcomes. Yet, LE seems to show more advantages in terms of postoperative complications and functional outcomes. These findings offer important insights for surgical decision-making, emphasizing the necessity to consider both oncological and functional outcomes in selecting the optimal surgical approach.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05454-y.",1
"AbstractCancer immunotherapy is used to treat tumors by modulating the immune system. Although the anticancer efficacy of cancer immunotherapy has been evaluated prior to clinical trials, conventional in vivo animal and endpoint models inadequately replicate the intricate process of tumor elimination and reflect human‐specific immune systems. Therefore, more sophisticated models that mimic the complex tumor‐immune microenvironment must be employed to assess the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Additionally, using real‐time imaging technology, a step‐by‐step evaluation can be applied, allowing for a more precise assessment of treatment efficacy. Here, an overview of the various imaging‐based evaluation platforms recently developed for cancer immunotherapeutic applications is presented. Specifically, a fundamental technique is discussed for stably observing immune cell‐based tumor cell killing using direct imaging, a microwell that reproduces a confined space for spatial observation, a droplet assay that facilitates cell–cell interactions, and a 3D microphysiological system that reconstructs the vascular environment. Furthermore, it is suggested that future evaluation platforms pursue more human‐like immune systems.","PurposeImmunotherapy with programmed cell death 1/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the systemic treatment of solid tumors, including bladder cancer. Previous studies have shown that enhanced glycolysis, tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration, and TGF-β secretion in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are closely related to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor immunotherapy resistance. However, the potential mechanism of their interaction in bladder cancer has not been fully uncovered.MethodsBy coculturing bladder cancer cells and TAMs, we studied the relationship and interaction mechanism between tumor cell glycolysis, TAM functional remodeling, TGF-β positive feedback secretion, and PD-L1 mRNA m6A methylation in the bladder cancer microenvironment.ResultsBioinformatics analysis and IHC staining found a close correlation between tumor glycolysis, M2 TAM infiltration, and the prognosis of bladder cancer patients. In Vitro experiments demonstrated that bladder cancer cells could re-educate M2 TAMs through lactate and promote TGF-β secretion via the HIF-1α signaling pathway. Reciprocally, in vitro, and in vivo experiments validated that M2 TAMs could promote glycolysis in bladder cancer cells by TGF-β via the Smad2/3 signaling pathways. Furthermore, M2 TAMs could also promote CSCs and EMT of bladder cancer cells. More importantly, we found M2 TAMs enhance PD-L1 mRNA m6A methylation by promoting METLL3 expression in bladder cancer via the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway in the TME.ConclusionsOur study highlights a feed-forward loop based on aerobic glycolysis and TGF-β between M2 TAMs and bladder cancer cells, which may be a potential mechanism of malignant progression and immunotherapy resistance in bladder cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05164-5.",0
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising non-invasive technique for treating solid tumors using thermal and histotripsy-based mechanical ablation. However, its clinical significance in different tumor types is not fully understood. To assess its therapeutic efficacy and immunomodulatory properties, we compared HIFU thermal ablation and histotripsy ablation in dogs with spontaneous tumors. We also evaluated the ability of non-ablative HIFU-based mild hyperthermia (40–45 °C) to improve Doxorubicin delivery and immunomodulation. Our results showed that HIFU thermal ablation induced tumor remission in the majority of treated patients over 60 days, while histotripsy achieved partial response to stable disease persistence. The adverse effects of thermal ablation were minor to moderate, while histotripsy exposures were relatively well-tolerated. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between HIFU-therapeutic response and serum anti-tumor cytokine profiles and the presence of functionally active cytotoxic immune cells in patients. Similarly, Doxorubicin-treated patients showed improved drug delivery, efficacy, and anti-tumor immune responses with HIFU hyperthermia. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that depending on the tumor type and treatment parameters, HIFU treatments can enable tumor growth control, immune activation, and chemotherapy in veterinary patient. These findings have significant clinical implications and highlight the potential of HIFU as a promising cancer treatment approach.","Purpose Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. To improve the therapeutic outcomes, drug delivery systems, and particularly liposomes, have been widely investigated. Therefore, this review analyzed systematically the literature to inquire about the safety and efficacy of liposomal formulations in lung cancer treatment.MethodsThree electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL) were systematically searched until May 2020. Clinical trials containing information about the effects of liposomal formulations in lung cancer patients were considered eligible.ResultsTwenty two selected studies present different treatment options for both small and non-small-cell lung cancers. After compiling and analyzing all the published information, we verified that combination of liposomal cisplatin and paclitaxel led to a statistically significant improvement of the evaluated outcomes. Moreover, tecemotide, a liposome-based immunotherapy, demonstrated lower toxicity compared to control groups. Evidences that other subgroups could benefit from this formulation were also provided.ConclusionThis systematic review (registration number CRD42021246587) demonstrates that liposomal formulations are promising alternatives to overcome limitations of traditional cancer therapy. However, larger, longer, randomized and double-blinded clinical trials, selecting their patients’ cohort considering more responsive subgroups would be beneficial to strengthen the scientific and clinical evidence of the results herein reported.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04079-x.",1
"PurposeDissociated response (DR, reduction at baseline or increase < 20% in target lesions compared with nadir in the presence of new lesions) was observed in 20–34% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). DRs were defined as progression disease (PD) per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1), while evaluation criteria related to immunotherapy incorporated the new lesions into the total tumor burden or conducted further evaluation after 4–8 weeks rather than declaring PD immediately. The main objective of this study is to compare survival between people who continuing initial ICIs treatment and those who switched to other anticancer therapy at the time of DR.Patients and methods235 patients with advanced lung cancer (LC) treated with ICIs were evaluated. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize potential confounding factors. Post-DR OS, target lesion changes were evaluated.Results52 patients had been estimated as DRs. After PSM, the continuing ICIs treatment Post-DR cohort still had a significantly longer median post-DR OS than discontinuing ICIs treatment Post-DR cohort, 10.63 months (95% CI 6.27–NA) versus 4.33 months (95% CI 1.77–NA), respectively (p = 0.016).ConclusionWithin the limitations of this single-center retrospective analysis, clinically stable patients who were judged by clinicians to be eligible for continuing ICIs treatment post-DR derived apparent OS benefit than discontinuing counterpart.","PurposeAging is closely related to the occurrence of many diseases, including cancer, and involves changes in the immune microenvironment. γδT cells are important components of resident lymphocytes in mucosal tissues. However, little is known about the effects that the aged lung has on γδT cells and their prognostic significance in non-small cell lung cancer.MethodsIn the current study, the expression of γδTCR and IL-17A was measured by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 168 patients with adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 144 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Furthermore, gene transcription patterns in LUAD and LUSC tumors and normal controls were extracted from TCGA and GTEx databases and were analyzed.ResultsHigh frequency of γδT cells was observed in patients with LUAD and LUSC, whereas the levels of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD56 + cells were decreased. Elevated γδT cells in tumors were mainly IL-17A-releasing γδT17 cells, which were found to be enriched in aged patients. High γδT cell levels positively corelated with the overall survival (OS) of patients, especially the 5-year OS in the elderly. Further analysis of gene transcription patterns indicated that increased expression of LTBR, HES1, RORC, CCR6, IL1, and IL23A may contribute to the transformation of the tumor microenvironment in a manner conducive to γδT17 cell development and differentiation. Finally, gene analysis between different age groups revealed that the expression of CCR6 and IL7 in LUAD, as well as Hes1, IL7, and IL23A in LUSC, were remarkably higher in elderly (age ≥ 60 years) than in younger individuals (age < 60 years).ConclusionOur findings suggest that intrinsic alterations in the aging lung lead to γδT17 cell enrichment, which subsequently may exert anti-tumor effects in the elderly.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03742-z.",1
"ABSTRACTLymphoma, a blood tumor, has become the ninth most common cancer in the world in 2020. Targeted inhibition is one of the important treatments for lymphoma. At present, there are many kinds of targeted drugs for the treatment of lymphoma. Studies have shown that Histone deacetylase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase all play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors and become important and promising inhibitory targets. This article mainly expounds the important role of these target protein in tumors, and introduces the mechanism of action, structure–activity relationship and clinical research of listed small molecule inhibitors of these targets, hoping to provide new ideas for the treatment of lymphoma.","The field of onco-microbiome is rapidly expanding. Multiple studies have shown the crucial role of gut microbiota in the regulation of nutrient metabolism, immunomodulation and protection against pathogens. Tools for manipulating the gut microbiota include dietary modification and faecal microbiota transfer. Accumulating evidence has also documented the application of specific intestinal microbiome in cancer immunotherapy, notably in enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aim of this review is to focus on the East Asian microbiome and to provide a current overview of microbiome science and its clinical application in cancer biology and immunotherapy.",0
"ABSTRACTAs COVID-19 is the third coronavirus epidemic in this century, it would be desirable to have a treatment scheme in anticipation of a fourth one. We here present a scheme that could clear SARS-CoV-2 in 2–4 days post-infection from the upper respiratory tract (URT), where the virions are initially concentrated. The scheme, applicable on a large scale by nasal spray, is based on homoharringtonine (HHT), which has been approved for treating other diseases. HHT blocked protein elongation and repressed in vitro replication of all four coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) that were tested at the nano-molar concentration, demonstrating its potential for broad effectiveness against coronaviruses. In animal models, HHT cleared SARS-CoV-2 in all treated mice within 3 days by daily nasal dripping of a small dose (40 μg). In December 2022, HHT was administered to 26 cancer patients by nebulization at 1 mg/day. On average, the viral load in the URT was reduced by three-quarters 6 hours after the nebulization. In the wavelet of May 2023, 11 patients without other medical conditions were administered HHT by repeated liquid nasal spray at the low total daily dose of 0.2 mg. Ten of the 11 patients were cleared of the virus in 2–4 days. In comparison, in large-cohort studies of participants in China during the same wave, most patients need 7–9 days to turn negative. No adverse effects were detected in any patient in the two clinical trials. A short review of drugs approved for treating COVID-19 shows the many advantages of HHT. With continual development, it could become a first-line defense at the onset of future coronavirus epidemics.","AbstractA major challenge to brain cancer immunotherapy is posed by the rate-limiting obstacles to the systemic delivery of cytotoxic T cells, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, in brain tumors posed by the blood brain barrier (BBB). Although the BBB can be bypassed by direct infusion of CAR-T cells in brain tumors, these approaches offer only short-term benefits, since they cannot affect distant tumor cell infiltrations, as evidenced by tumor relapse. Circulating microbubbles (MB) upon ultrasound (US) exposure (sonication) can exert mechanical stress in brain vessels to trigger a range of responses, including local increase in the BBB permeability and activation of inflammatory signaling and phenotypes. We hypothesize that ultrasound frequency tuned at MB resonance inside brain capillaries can transiently modulate the BBB signaling and function to improve CAR-T cell trafficking in glioma tumors. RNAseq and immunostaining of protein expression reveal that at frequencies just above microbubble resonance inside vessels (1.5MHz for 2µm MB), where maximum vessel wall shear stress is observed, there is a marked enrichment of inflammatory markers in the endothelial cells of brain vessels, including P-selectin and ICAM-1. Consistent with these findings, we observed that under high frequency excitation (1.5MHz), there is a 5-fold increase in the accumulation of EGFRvIII CAR-T cells in orthotopic EGFRvIII murine glioma tumors as compared not sonicated controls. We also found that over 85% of the tumor-infiltrating CAR-T cells express PSGL-1 and LFA-1 receptors, which interact with P-selectin and ICAM-1 to facilitate T cell extravasation. Together, these findings demonstrate that tuning the US frequency can improve CAR-T cell trafficking, potentially through upregulation of cell adhesion molecules in the glioma tumor microenvironment, and further support the functional relevance and potential clinical significance of the observed immuno-mechano-biological changes.",0
"Background and Clinical Significance: Radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) following immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has been infrequently reported. Case Presentation: We present a 47-year-old female patient who developed RRD of the breast following three doses of pembrolizumab administered as an adjuvant treatment post-nephrectomy for Stage III renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Notably, the affected breast had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy 247 weeks earlier for Stage IA invasive ductal carcinoma. She had received no prior chemotherapy at any point. RRD manifested as breast induration, erythema, and peau d’orange, and contraction of breast volume was noted following three cycles of pembrolizumab on week 17 (400 mg dose every 6 weeks). The dermatitis responded rapidly to systemic corticosteroids and no treatment interruption was needed. Conclusions: To date, this is the longest reported interval from completion of radiotherapy to RRD. A literature search underscores the variability in presentation and management of ICI-associated RRD.","Objectives:To determine the clinical predictors of response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival to pembrolizumab in advanced or recurrent, mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) or Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) endometrial adenocarcinomas.Methods:A retrospective, single institution study was conducted among women with recurrent or advanced MMRd or MSI-H endometrial adenocarcinomas treated with single-agent pembrolizumab at our institution from 2017 to 2021. Logistic regression was used for univariable and multivariable analyses. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier and modeled via Cox proportional hazards regression. Log-rank test was used for intergroup comparisons based on body mass index (BMI). A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results:Among the 44 patients included in the analysis, the mean age was 64.1 years (range 41–87) and mean BMI was 32.9 (range 18.5–51.8). Mean cycles of pembrolizumab given was 12.8 (range 2–37). Median follow-up was 33 months (range 5–61) with a response rate of 63.6% and stable disease rate of 75%. When stratified by obesity status (BMI>30), disease control rate was 59.8% in patients with a BMI<30 and 85.2% in patients with a BMI≥30 patients (p=0.05). On multivariable analysis, obesity was associated with increased rate of disease control (OR 4.03, 95% CI 1.09, 28) while prior smoking was associated with decreased rate of disease control (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03, 0.85). PFS was significantly increased among patients with a BMI≥30 (p=0.03) but OS was similar (p=0.5)Conclusion:In this retrospective study, obesity is associated with increased rates of disease control and improved PFS in patients treated with single-agent pembrolizumab for recurrent or advanced MMRd or MSI-H endometrial adenocarcinomas.",1
"ABSTRACTBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, but they can induce immune-related adverse events, including immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonia (CIP), a severe lung complication. CIP, particularly Grades 3–4, is associated with poor prognosis, indicating a critical need for research on this issue. Our study aimed to investigate the risk factors and biomarkers associated with severe CIP in lung cancer patients treated with ICIs, where OS represents overall survival and PFS denotes progression-free survival.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 106 lung cancer patients with CIP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 2019 to 2023, categorized into four severity grades.ResultsThe median time to onset of CIP was 5.17 months. Patients with Grade 3–4 CIP had a median PFS of 6.5 months and OS of 11.2 months. Univariate analysis identified phosphocreatine kinase below 61.5 U/l, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) below 1.96, and BMI below 21.26 as predictive factors for Grades 3–4 CIP. Multivariate analysis confirmed that a decreased FVC was a significant predictor.ConclusionsA decreased FVC below 1.96 emerged as a predictive factor for Grades 3–4 CIP, highlighting the importance of monitoring FVC in patients receiving ICIs.","BackgroundB7-H3 is a cell surface immunomodulatory glycoprotein overexpressed in prostate cancers (PC). Understanding its longitudinal expression at emergence of castration-resistance, and association with tumour genomics, is critical to the development of and patient selection for B7-H3 targeted therapies.ObjectiveTo characterize B7-H3 expression in same-patient, castration-sensitive PC (CSPC) and castration-resistant PC (CRPC) biopsies, associating this with PC genomics, and to evaluate the antitumour activity of an anti-B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in human CRPC in vitro and in vivo.Design, setting, and participantsWe performed IHC and next generation sequencing on a cohort of 98 clinically annotated, CRPC biopsies, among which 72 patients had CSPC biopsies for analyses. We analysed two CRPC transcriptome and exome datasets. PC organoids (PDX-Os) were derived from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generated from human CRPC biopsies.Outcome measurementsWe evaluated B7-H3 mRNA expression in relation to a panel of 770 immune-related genes; compared B7-H3 protein expression between same-patient CSPC and CRPC biopsies; determined associations with PC genomic alterations; evaluated the antitumour activity of DS-7300a, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor payload anti-B7-H3 ADC, in human PC cell lines, organoids and xenografts of different histologies, B7-H3 expressions, and genomics.Results and limitationsB7-H3 was one of the most highly expressed immunomodulatory genes in CRPCs. Most CSPCs (97%) and CRPCs (93%) expressed B7-H3 and conversion from B7-H3 positive to negative, or vice versa, during progression from CSPC to CRPC was rare. B7-H3 is overexpressed in tumours with defective DNA repair (DDR) gene (ATM, BRCA1/2) alterations compared to tumours without DDR gene alteration. DS7300a had antitumour activity against B7-H3 expressing human PC models including cell lines, PDX-Os and PDXs of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine histology.ConclusionsB7-H3 is overexpressed in the majority of PCs, especially DDR defective tumours. B7-H3 positive CRPC may be targeted with an anti-B7-H3 ADC.Patient summaryB7-H3, a protein expressed on the surface of most lethal PC, and in particular those with specific mutations, can be targeted using drugs that bind B7-H3 and carry potent chemotherapies. These drugs are being evaluated in cancer patients.",0
"SummaryThe mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) family of chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in regulating DNA accessibility and gene expression. The three final-form subcomplexes – cBAF, PBAF, and ncBAF— are distinct in biochemical componentry, chromatin targeting, and roles in disease, however the contributions of their constituent subunits to gene expression remain incompletely defined. Here, we performed Perturb-seq-based CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens targeting mSWI/SNF subunits individually and in select combinations, followed by single-cell RNA-seq and SHARE-Seq. We uncovered complex-, module-, and subunit-specific contributions to distinct regulatory networks, and defined paralog subunit relationships and shifted subcomplex functions upon perturbations. Synergistic, intra-complex genetic interactions between subunits reveal functional redundancy and modularity. Importantly, single-cell subunit perturbation signatures mapped across bulk primary human tumor expression profiles both mirror and predict cBAF loss-of-function status in cancer. Our findings highlight the utility of Perturb-Seq to dissect disease-relevant gene regulatory impacts of heterogeneous, multi-component master regulatory complexes.","ObjectiveGanoderic acid A can inhibit the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells. Surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of ganoderic acid A still remain poorly defined. Ganoderic acid A derivative (GaAD19) is an effective ingredient obtained by structural modification of ganoderic acid A. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-proliferation effect of GaAD19 on cervical cancer cells.MethodsThrough the HeLa cervical cancer cell model, the drug target of GaAD19 was predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database and molecular docking. Subsequently, computer analysis results were verified by a series of molecular biology experiments, such as flow cytometry, Western blot, immunocytochemical staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and so on. Then, pathway agonists and inhibitors were used to investigate the mechanism of GaAD19. Finally, the mouse model of cervical cancer was established to evaluate the inhibitory effect of GaAD19 on tumor growth in U14 cervical cancer mice.ResultsGaAD19 induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of tumors. It also blocked the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. However, in the presence of a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)agonist, the effects of GaAD19 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle transition of cancer cells were suppressed.ConclusionThis study showed that GaAD19 can play an anti-cervical cancer role by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway. These results will be helpful in further exploring the mechanism of GaAD19 in the treatment of cervical cancer.",0
"Background:Actinic keratoses (AK) are rough scaly patches that arise on chronically ultraviolet-exposed skin and can progress to keratinocyte carcinoma.Objective:This analysis examined the literature related to the management of AK to provide evidence-based recommendations for treatment. Grading, histologic classification, natural history, risk of progression, and dermatologic surveillance of AKs are also discussed.Methods:A multidisciplinary Work Group conducted a systematic review to address 5 clinical questions on the management of AKs and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading clinical recommendations. Graded recommendations were voted on to achieve consensus.Results:Analysis of the evidence resulted in 18 recommendations.Limitations:This analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time it was conducted. The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English language randomized trials may have excluded data published in other languages or limited identification of relevant long-term follow-up data.Conclusions:Strong recommendations are made for using ultraviolet protection, topical imiquimod, topical 5-fluorouracil, and cryosurgery. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of photodynamic therapy and diclofenac for the treatment of AK, both individually and as part of combination therapy regimens.","Background:Actinic keratoses (AK) are rough scaly patches that arise on chronically ultraviolet-exposed skin and can progress to keratinocyte carcinoma.

"ObjectiveAlthough the use of osimertinib can significantly improve the survival time of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with epithelial growth factor receptor mutation, eventually drug resistance will limit the survival benefit of most patients. This study aimed to develop a novel prognostic predictive signature based on genes associated with osimertinib resistance.MethodsThe differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with osimertinib resistance in LUAD were screened from Gene Expression Omnibus datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Multivariate cox regression was used to establish a prognostic signature, and then a nomogram was developed to predict the survival probability of LUAD patients. We used ROC curve and DCA curve to evaluate its clinical prediction accuracy and net benefit. In addition, the differentially expressed genes significantly associated with prognosis were selected for immune infiltration analysis and drug sensitivity analysis, and their roles in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma were verified by in vitro experiments.ResultsOur evaluation results indicated that the new nomogram had higher clinical prediction accuracy and net benefit value than the TN nomogram. Further analysis showed that patients with low STRIP2 expression had a higher level of immune response, and may be more likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and conventional antitumor drugs. This may help to select more precise and appropriate therapy for LUAD patients with osimertinib resistance. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that STRIP2 promoted the LUAD cells proliferation, migration and invasion. This further demonstrates the importance of this gene signature for prognostic prediction.ConclusionWe developed a reliable prognostic model based on DEGs associated with osimertinib resistance and screened for biomarker that can predict the immune response in LUAD patients, which may help in the selection of treatment regimens after osimertinib resistance.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05294-w.","PurposeGlioma is the most common and fatal type of brain tumour. Owing to its aggressiveness and lethality, early diagnosis and prediction of patient survival are very important. This study aimed to identify key genes and biomarkers for glioma that can guide clinicians in making rapid diagnosis and prognostication.MethodsData mining of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data, and Genotype-Tissue Expression Project brain expression data revealed significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the risk scores of individual patients were calculated. WGCNA was utilized to screen for genes most related to clinical diagnosis. Prognostic genes associated with glioma were selected via combining the LASSO regression with univariate and multivariate Cox regression and protein–protein interaction network analyses. Then, a nomogram was constructed. And CGGA dataset was utilized to validated. The protein expression levels of the signature were detected using the human protein atlas. Drug response prediction was carried out using the package “pRRophetic”.ResultsA six-gene signature (KLF6, CHI3L1, SERPINE1, ANGPT2, TGFBR1, and PTX3) was identified and used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups. Survival, ROC curve, and Cox analyses clarified that the six hub genes were a favourable independent prognostic factor for patients with glioma. A nomogram was set up by integrating clinical parameters with risk signatures, showing high precision for predicting 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-years survival. In addition, the expression of most genes was consistent with protein expression. Furthermore, the sensitivity to the top ten drugs in the GDSC database of the high-risk group was significantly higher than the low-risk group.ConclusionBased on genetic profiles and clinicopathological features, including age, grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status, we constructed a comprehensive prognostic model for patients with glioma. These signatures can be regarded as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of gliomas, possibly providing more therapeutic strategies for future clinical research.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05082-6.",1
"Aim: We aimed to investigate the predictive value of the Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) expression from circulating blood for recurrence, metastasis and overall death on patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Materials & Methods: We collected blood samples from 122 patients who were admitted to our hospital for NSCLC.Results: Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis in adjusted Model II showed that compared with GRHL2-negative expression, positive expression in patients with NSCLC was associated with increased death risk (HR = 7.0, 95% CI: 2.1–20.9, p = 0.03) and risk for composite end point (HR = 8.2, 95% CI: 4.0–27.1, p <0.01).Conclusion: This study supported that elevated circulating GRHL2 expression might be considered as a candidate prognostic biomarker for poor prognosis among these NSCLC patients.","Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a type of RNA that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where it is translated into proteins. mRNA has emerged as a powerful platform for development of new types of medicine, especially after the clinical approval of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Chemical modification and nanoparticle delivery have contributed to this success significantly by improving mRNA stability, reducing its immunogenicity, protecting it from enzymatic degradation, and enhancing cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Recently, substantial progresses have been made in new modification chemistries, sequence design, and structural engineering to generate more stable and efficient next-generation mRNAs. These innovations could further facilitate the clinical translation of mRNA therapies and vaccines. Given that numerous review articles have been published on mRNA nanoparticle delivery and biomedical applications over the last few years, we herein focus on overviewing recent advances in mRNA chemical modification, mRNA sequence optimization, and mRNA engineering (for example, circular RNA and multitailed mRNA), with the aim of providing new perspectives on the development of more effective and safer mRNA medicines.",0
"BackgroundDelivering stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with multiple oligometastases represents a challenge for clinical and technical reasons. We aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with SABR and the impact of tumor volume on survival.Materials and methodsWe included all the patients treated with single course SABR for 3 to 5 extracranial oligometastases. All patients were treated with the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique with ablative intent. End-points of the analysis were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), local control (LC) and toxicity.Results136 patients were treated from 2012 to 2020 on 451 oligometastases. Most common primary tumor was colorectal cancer (44.1%) followed by lung cancer (11.8%). A total of 3, 4 and 5 lesions were simultaneously treated in 102 (75.0%), 26 (19.1%), and 8 (5.9%) patients, respectively. Median total tumor volume (TTV) was 19.1 cc (range 0.6–245.1). With a median follow-up of 25.0 months, OS at 1 and 3 years was 88.4% and 50.2%, respectively. Increasing TTV was independent predictive factor of worse OS (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.18–4.78, p = 0.014) and PFS (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.05–2.54; p = 0.028). Median OS was 80.6 months if tumor volume was ≤ 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 93.6% and 77.5%, respectively), and 31.1 months if TTV was higher than 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 86.7% and 42.3%, respectively). Rates of LC at 1 and 3 years were 89.3% and 76.5%. In terms of toxicity, no grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported both in the acute and late settings.ConclusionWe demonstrated the impact of tumor volume on survival and disease control of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with single course SABR.","BackgroundRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 80–90% of all kidney tumors and about 15–25% of patients will develop distant metastases. Systemic therapy represents the standard of care for metastatic patients, but stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) may play a relevant role in the oligoprogressive setting, defined as the progression of few metastases during an ongoing systemic therapy on a background of otherwise stable disease. Aim of the present study was to analyze the outcome of RCC patients treated with SABR on oligoprogressive metastases.Materials and methodsIn this monocenter study, we analyzed patients affected by RCC treated with SABR on a maximum of 5 cranial or extracranial oligoprogressive sites of disease. Endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity.ResultsWe included 74 oligoprogressions (26 intracranial and 48 extracranial) and 57 SABR treatments in 44 patients. Most common concomitant treatments were sunitinib (28, 49.1%), pazopanib (12, 21.0%) and nivolumab (11, 19.3%). Median follow-up was 19.0 months, and 1- and 2-year OS rates were 79.2% and 57.3%, respectively. Repeated SABR was a positive predictive factor for OS (p = 0.034). Median PFS was 9.8 months, with 1- and 2-year rates of 43.2% and 25.8%. At multivariable analysis, disease-free interval (p = 0.022) and number of treated metastases (p = 0.007) were significant for PFS. About 80% of patients continued the ongoing systemic therapy 1- and 2-years after SABR with no grade 3 or 4 toxicities.Conclusionswe confirmed the efficacy and safety of SABR for oligoprogression from RCC, with the potential to ablate resistant metastases and to prolong the ongoing systemic therapy.",1
"Background and purposeThe intricate mechanisms underlying intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment remain largely elusive. Recently, attention has shifted towards exploring the intercellular signaling mediated by exosomal long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) within this context. This comprehensive systematic review aims to elucidate the functional paradigm of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer.Materials and methodsThe review provides a comprehensive narrative of lncRNA definition, characteristics, as well as the formation, sorting, and uptake processes of exosome-derived lncRNAs. Additionally, it describes comprehensive technology for exosome research and nucleic acid drug loading. This review further systematically examines the cellular origins, functional roles, and underlying mechanisms of exosome-derived lncRNAs in recipient cells within the cancer setting.ResultsThe functional paradigm of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer mainly depends on the source cells and sorting mechanism of exosomal lncRNAs, the recipient cells and uptake mechanisms of exosomal lncRNAs, and the specific molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in recipient cells. The source cells of exosomal lncRNAs mainly involved in the current review included tumor cells, cancer stem cells, normal cells, macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts.ConclusionThis synthesis of knowledge offers valuable insights for accurately identifying exosomal lncRNAs with potential as tumor biomarkers. Moreover, it aids in the selection of appropriate targeting strategies and preclinical models, thereby facilitating the clinical translation of exosomal lncRNAs as promising therapeutic targets against cancer. Through a comprehensive understanding of the functional role of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer, this review paves the way for advancements in personalized medicine and improved treatment outcomes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05273-1.","IntroductionThe urinary microbiome (UMB) includes living bacteria, their genomes, and their products from interactions with the host environment. A “core” UMB could potentially exist, with variations between age and sex groups. Changes in UMB composition have been associated with benign urological disorders, but also with urologic cancers. Mechanisms through which UMB can trigger and maintain cancer can be local inflammation and interaction with immune system.Aim of the studyTo describe the association between UMB and development of urologic cancers.MethodsA non-systematic literature review identified recently published studies (last 5 years), involving human patients, dealing with UMB. The database used for this review was PubMed, and the identified studies served as the base for a narrative analysis of the literature that explored the potential associations between UMB and urological cancers.ResultsIn bladder cancer (BC), UMB may play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (and thus to progression to metastasis), as well as in effectiveness of BCG response rate. BC is also associated with changes in UMB, with bacterial richness indices increased in cancer groups compared to non-neoplastic groups and being different between NMIBC vs MIBC patients. In prostate cancer (PCa), there is an abundance in proinflammatory bacteria and uropathogens. In regard to renal cell carcinoma (RCC), penile cancer and testicular cancer there are still too few studies to draw significant conclusions about its relationship with the UMB.ConclusionsGaining a deeper understanding of UMB role in urologic tumors could aid in the development of new therapies and improve classification of patients’ risk.",0
"PurposeAs one of the most effective analgesics, opioids are essential for patients with cancer-related pain, even in the context of the opioid abuse crisis. The current meta-analysis aimed to identify whether concomitant exposure to opioids can affect the efficacy of ICIs and lead to a worse prognosis.MethodsPubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched based on the PRISMA checklist, through April 2022, for the following terms: (""opioids"" OR ""concomitant medication"") AND (""Neoplasm"" OR ""Carcinoma"" OR ""Cancer"" OR ""Tumor"") AND (""Immunotherapy"" OR ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor"" OR ""PD-L1 Inhibitor"" OR ""PD-1 Inhibitor"" OR ""CTLA-4 Inhibitor""). The outcomes considered were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) calculated using the random-effects or fixed-effects model.ResultsAfter screening 531 studies, a total of 7 articles involving 2690 patients were eligible for quantitative analysis. The use of opioids was negatively correlated with OS (HR 1.75, 95%CI 1.32–2.31, P < 0.001; I2 = 81%, P < 0.001) and significantly reduced the PFS (HR 1.61, 95%CI 1.41–1.83, P < 0.001; I2 = 0%, P = 0.63) of patients treated with ICIs. Similar results were obtained in each subgroup analysis. While NSAIDs could lead to poor OS (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03–1.51, P = 0.02; I2 = 0%, P = 0.60) but not PFS (HR 1.11, 95% CI = 0.89–1.39, P = 0.36) for ICIs patients. And sensitivity analyses confirmed the reliability of the results.ConclusionOpioids significantly reduced OS and PFS in patients receiving ICI therapy. Thus, the use of different types of opioids should be considered with caution, and it is necessary to actively develop alternative treatments.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04513-0.","AbstractThe clinical approval of platinum‐based drugs has prompted the development of novel metallo‐complexes during the last several decades, while severe problems, especially for poor water solubility, drug resistance and toxicity in patients, greatly hindered the clinical trials and curative efficacy. To address these issues, the concept of metallo‐prodrugs has been proposed for oncology. Some stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs provide new insights for designing and preparing site‐specific prodrugs with maximized therapeutic efficacy and negligible unfavorable by‐effects. In this review, recent progress in stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs in the past 20 years has been overviewed, where endogenous and exogenous stimuli have been involved. Typical examples of smart stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs are discussed regarding to their molecular structure, activation mechanism, and promising biomedical applications. In the end, challenges and future perspectives in metallo‐prodrugs have been discussed.",0
"ObjectiveCervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is one of the most relevant influencing factors for the oncological outcome of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Several studies showed that the tumors depth of invasion (DOI) influences the risk for CLNM, however varying across the oral subsites. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of DOI and other risk factors in OSCC of the tongue in relation to the occurrence of occult CLNM.Materials and methodsIn this retrospective study, n = 139 patients with primary OSCC of the tongue, treated by complete surgical resection (R0) with curative intention between 2013 and 2021, were included. For data analysis, epidemiologic data as well as preoperative tumor staging, surgical therapy including neck management, histopathological tumor data and follow-up were considered. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine association between histopathological risk factors and the occurrence of occult CLNM.ResultsThe rate of occult cervical metastasis was 19.4%. T-staging, cervical nodal disease (pN+) and lymphatic invasion were significantly associated with reduced OS and RFS. While DOI had no relevant influence on the OS and RFS (p = 0.88 and p = 0.91 respectively), there was significant correlation between DOI and the occurrence of occult CLNM (OR: 1.17, 95%CI: 1.05–1.30; p < 0.01). The optimal cutoff in predicting occult CLNM was 6 mm (Sensitivity: 84.2%, Specificity: 73.5%, AUC: 0.75).ConclusionsThe DOI is a helpful risk parameter to predict the occurrence of occult nodal disease in OSCC of the tongue. Given the critical decision cutoff between 2 and 4 mm DOI for performing elective neck dissection in the current guidelines, our data suggests that in these cases, surgical de-escalation could be feasible with close follow-up.Clinical relevanceThis study highlights the relevance of DOI as a risk parameter in the prediction of CLNM with the aim to specify the individual patient risk and to deescalate surgical therapy in order to decrease comorbidities while improving the oncological prognosis.","SummaryThe mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) family of chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in regulating DNA accessibility and gene expression. The three final-form subcomplexes – cBAF, PBAF, and ncBAF— are distinct in biochemical componentry, chromatin targeting, and roles in disease, however the contributions of their constituent subunits to gene expression remain incompletely defined. Here, we performed Perturb-seq-based CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens targeting mSWI/SNF subunits individually and in select combinations, followed by single-cell RNA-seq and SHARE-Seq. We uncovered complex-, module-, and subunit-specific contributions to distinct regulatory networks, and defined paralog subunit relationships and shifted subcomplex functions upon perturbations. Synergistic, intra-complex genetic interactions between subunits reveal functional redundancy and modularity. Importantly, single-cell subunit perturbation signatures mapped across bulk primary human tumor expression profiles both mirror and predict cBAF loss-of-function status in cancer. Our findings highlight the utility of Perturb-Seq to dissect disease-relevant gene regulatory impacts of heterogeneous, multi-component master regulatory complexes.",0
"IntroductionWe described the patterns of chemotherapy use and outcomes in patients diagnosed with stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by age in England.Materials and MethodsIn this retrospective population-based study, we included 20,716 (62% stage IV) patients with NSCLC diagnosed from 2014 to 2017 treated with chemotherapy. We used the Systemic Anti-Cancer Treatment (SACT) dataset to describe changes in treatment plan and estimated 30 and 90-day mortality rates and median, 6-, and 12-month overall survival (OS) using Kaplan Meier estimator for patients aged <75 and ≥ 75 by stage. Using flexible hazard regression models we assessed the impact of age, stage, treatment intent (stage III), and performance status on survival.ResultsPatients aged ≥75 years were less likely to receive two or more regimens, more likely to have their treatment modified because of comorbidities and their doses reduced compared to younger patients. However, early mortality rates and overall survival were similar across ages, apart from the oldest patients with stage III disease.DiscussionThis observational study demonstrates that age is associated with treatment patterns in an older population with advanced NSCLC in England. Although this reflects a pre-immunotherapy period, given the median age of NSCLC patients and increasingly older population, these results suggest older patients (>75 yrs) may benefit from more intense treatments.","PurposeTo describe long-term prescribed drug use after rectal cancer treatment.MethodsWe identified 12,871 rectal cancer patients without distant metastasis between 2005 and 2016 and 64,341 matched population comparators using CRCBaSe (a Swedish nationwide register linkage of colorectal cancer patients). Mean defined daily doses (DDDs) of drug dispensing during relapse-free follow-up were calculated by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical drug categories. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from negative binomial regression were used to compare drug dispensing between patients and comparators.ResultsThe overall pattern of drug dispensing was similar among cancer survivors and comparators, although patients had higher mean DDDs of drugs regulating the digestive system. Excess dispensing of drugs for constipation (IRR, 3.35; 95% CI, 3.12–3.61), diarrhea (IRR, 6.43; 95% CI, 5.72–7.22), functional gastrointestinal disorders (IRR, 3.78; 95% CI, 3.15–4.54), and vitamin and mineral supplements (IRR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.24–1.50) was observed up to 10 years after surgery. Treatment with Hartmann’s procedure was associated with higher dispensing rates of digestive drugs compared to surgery with anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection but the association was attributed to higher use of diabetic drugs. Additionally, excess digestive drug dispensing was associated with more advanced cancer stage but not with (chemo)radiotherapy treatment.ConclusionsExcess drug use after rectal cancer is primarily driven by bowel-regulating drugs and is not modified by surgical or oncological treatment.Implications for Cancer SurvivorsThe excess use of bowel-regulating drugs after rectal cancer indicated long-standing postsurgical gastrointestinal morbidity and need of prophylaxis. Reassuringly, no excess use of other drug classes was noted long term.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11764-024-01548-9.",1
"Background and aims:Knowledge about the association between oral microbiome diversity within individuals and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortality is scarce. Besides, variation by sex and racial and ethnic groups, and the potential mediators of these associations remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations of oral microbiome alpha diversity with all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality, and the interaction effects of sex and racial and ethnic groups and potential mediators in the associations.Methods:The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a population-based observational study, conducted periodically in Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, and other racial/ethnic participants. We linked 2009–12 survey data of 8,199 adults to the mortality data until 2019. By analyzing RNA gene sequences from oral rinse samples, microbiome alpha diversity within individuals was assessed using operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness. Potential mediators included obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and periodontitis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression and causal mediation analysis were used.Results:Baseline mean±standard deviation (SD) age was 42.1±15.1 years. Over a median follow-up of 9.1 years, 405 all-cause mortality occurred (CVD, 105; non-CVD, 300). Each 1-SD increment in OTU richness was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–0.95), CVD mortality (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90–0.95), and non-CVD mortality (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90–0.95). With evidence of significant racial and ethnic groups-interaction (P ˂0.05), these associations were evident in Mexican American, NH White, and others racial/ethnic participants. None of the potential mediators significantly mediated the associations of OTU richness with all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality.Conclusions:Lower oral microbiome alpha diversity is associated with higher risk for all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality, and the associations are varied by racial and ethnic groups.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that perform post-transcriptional gene regulation. This review focuses on the role of tumor cell-derived miRNAs in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) via receptor cell recoding, including angiogenesis, expression of immunosuppressive molecules, formation of radiation resistance, and chemoresistance. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of these molecules as adjuvant therapies in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy, as well as their advantages as efficacy predictors for personalized therapy. MiRNA-based therapeutic agents for tumors are currently in clinical trials, and while challenges remain, additional research on tumor-derived miRNAs is warranted, which may provide significant clinical benefits to cancer patients.",0
"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B has been recognized as a major determinant of discrepancies in disease outcomes, and recent evidence suggests a role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) efficacy. The B44 supertype, which features an electropositive binding pocket that preferentially displays peptides with negatively charged amino acid anchors, associated with improved survival in ICB-treated melanoma. Yet this effect was not seen in ICB-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we show that mutations leading to glutamic acid substitutions occur more often in melanoma than NSCLC based on mutational landscape. We additionally show stratifying B44 based on the presence of somatic mutations that lead to negatively charged glutamic acid anchors identifies NSCLC patients with ICB benefit similar to that seen in melanoma. We anticipate these findings could improve assessment of HLA-related outcomes and prediction of ICB benefit in those with B44, representing approximately half of the world’s population.","PurposeThe phenomenon of immunogenic cell death (ICD) is intricately linked to numerous antitumor treatments and exerts a profound regulatory function in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). We aimed to establish a prognostic signature from the ICD-related biomarkers to differentiate the TIME in hepatocellular carcinoma and predict diverse outcomes for patients with liver cancer.MethodsICD score-related genes (ICDSGs) were identified using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The ICD score-related signature (ICDSsig) was established by applying LASSO and Cox regression. Model precision was verified using the external datasets. We used independent prognostic variables in clinicopathologic factors to develop a nomogram. Further, clinical characteristics, immune and molecular landscapes, the responses of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and immunotherapy, and chemotherapy sensitivity were analyzed for high- and low-risk patients.ResultsICD score—calculated using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA)—displayed strong associations with the TIME in HCC. We identified 34 ICDSGs after integrating the TCGA and GSE104580 datasets. Then, three novel ICDSGs (DNASE1L3, KLRB1, and LILRB1) were screened out to construct the ICDSsig; the prognostic signature performed well in the external databases. The high-risk patients had worse outcomes owing to their advanced pathological state, non-response of TACE, and immune-cold phenotype in the immune landscapes. The immune checkpoint genes, N6-methyladenosine-relevant genes, and microsatellite instability score were increased in the high-risk subgroup, thereby indicating a favorable sensitivity to immunotherapy. Common chemotherapy drugs were more effective in high-risk patients due to low half-maximal inhibitory concentration values.ConclusionThe ICDSsig can potentially predict outcomes and therapeutic responses for patients with liver cancer and may assist clinicians in designing individualized treatment strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05017-1.",0
"The differential diagnosis for multiple intracranial lesions in a young adult is broad and includes demyelinating, neoplastic, and infectious etiologies. In this report, we describe the case of a 19-year-old immunocompetent woman presenting with progressive headaches and aphasia. MRI of the brain revealed multiple, large supratentorial lesions with concentric bands of alternating T2 signal intensities and peripheral contrast enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was overall bland with negative oligoclonal bands. Serum antibody testing for neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and myelin-oligodendrocyte associated disease (MOGAD) were negative. A broad infectious work-up was also unrevealing. A definitive diagnosis was ultimately obtained after brain biopsy and the patient was started on appropriate therapy. This case highlights a diagnostic framework in evaluating immunocompetent patients presenting with multiple intracranial lesions and progressive neurological decline. The main differential diagnoses for this constellation of radiological and clinical findings are discussed and a literature review is performed on the revealed diagnosis. Lastly, both acute and long-term therapeutic approaches are reviewed.","BackgroundOvarian cancer patients’ resistance to first-line treatment posed a significant challenge, with approximately 70% experiencing recurrence and developing strong resistance to first-line chemotherapies like paclitaxel.ObjectivesWithin the framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM), this study aimed to use artificial intelligence to find drug resistance characteristics at the single cell, and further construct the classification strategy and deep learning prognostic models based on these resistance traits, which can better facilitate and perform 3PM.MethodsThis study employed “Beyondcell,” an algorithm capable of predicting cellular drug responses, to calculate the similarity between the expression patterns of 21,937 cells from ovarian cancer samples and the signatures of 5201 drugs to identify drug-resistance cells. Drug resistance features were used to perform 10 multi-omics clustering on the TCGA training set to identify patient subgroups with differential drug responses. Concurrently, a deep learning prognostic model with KAN architecture which had a flexible activation function to better fit the model was constructed for this training set. The constructed patient subtype classifier and prognostic model were evaluated using three external validation sets from GEO: GSE17260, GSE26712, and GSE51088.ResultsThis study identified that endothelial cells are resistant to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and docetaxel, suggesting their potential as targets for cellular therapy in ovarian cancer patients. Based on drug resistance features, 10 multi-omics clustering identified four patient subtypes with differential responses to four chemotherapy drugs, in which subtype CS2 showed the highest drug sensitivity to all four drugs. The other subtypes also showed enrichment in different biological pathways and immune infiltration, allowing for targeted treatment based on their characteristics. Besides, this study applied the latest KAN architecture in artificial intelligence to replace the MLP structure in the DeepSurv prognostic model, finally demonstrating robust performance on patients’ prognosis prediction.ConclusionsThis study, by classifying patients and constructing prognostic models based on resistance characteristics to first-line drugs, has effectively applied multi-omics data into the realm of 3PM.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-024-00374-4.",0
"PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the potential role of low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) as a radiosensitizer by evaluating its impact on the immune response and the abscopal effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy through preclinical models.Materials and MethodsCT26 tumors (immunologically hot) and 4T1 tumors (immunologically cold), grown in immunocompetent BALB/c and immunodeficient BALB/c–nude mice, were irradiated with 20 Gy in two fractions with 5-day spacing followed by intraperitoneal injections of 9 mg/kg Cy every 3 days. Immunological changes in CT26 tumors caused by the treatments were assessed using flow cytometry. Changes in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in tumors were also assessed. Splenocytes and bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (DCs) were exposed to various concentrations of Cy to assess T cell proliferation and DC differentiation.ResultsThe combination of Cy with radiotherapy (RT+Cy) significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to RT alone in immunocompetent mice, while that effect was not observed in immunodeficient mice. Additionally, RT+Cy effectively induced abscopal effects in hot and cold tumors, with increased CD8+ T cells in blood and tumors. Significantly higher expression levels of granzyme B, interferon γ, and tumor necrosis factor α were observed in RT+Cy group compared to the RT alone group. In vitro data indicated that low-dose Cy promotes DC differentiation. Low-dose Cy suppressed the radiation-induced upregulation of HIF-1α in the tumors.ConclusionLow-dose Cy enhances tumoricidal effects of 5-day spacing high-dose RT by increasing antitumor immune responses.","AbstractRationaleHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.Eligibility criteriaParallel‐group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross‐over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi‐randomised trials for analysis.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non‐serious.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta‐analysed the outcome data at the longest follow‐up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random‐effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.Included studiesWe included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single‐centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia‐Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co‐interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information.The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow‐up was three months to five years.Synthesis of resultsTen trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions.Eight trials evaluated all‐cause mortality at varied follow‐up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow‐up periods taken together.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one‐year follow‐up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events.One trial measured health‐related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow‐up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health‐related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health‐related quality of life scores. No further data were provided.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non‐serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non‐serious.We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.We identified no ongoing trials.Authors' conclusionsBased on the low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all‐cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events considered non‐serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationProtocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014869.",0
"PurposeEarly biochemical recurrence (eBCR) indicated a high risk for potential recurrence and metastasis in prostate cancer. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification played an important role in prostate cancer progression. This study aimed to develop a m6A lncRNA signature to accurately predict eBCR in prostate cancer.MethodsPearson correlation analysis was first conducted to explore m6A lncRNAs and univariate Cox regression analysis was further performed to identify m6A lncRNAs of prognostic roles for predicting eBCR in prostate cancer. The m6A lncRNA signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis (LASSO) in training cohort and further validated in test cohort. Furthermore, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were utilized to explore potential effective drugs for high-risk group in this study.ResultsFive hundred and thirty-eighth m6A lncRNAs were searched out through Pearson correlation analysis and 25 out of 538 m6A lncRNAs were identified to pose prediction roles for eBCR in prostate cancers. An m6A lncRNA signature including 5 lncRNAs was successfully built in training cohort. The high-risk group derived from m6A lncRNA signature could efficiently predict eBCR occurrence in both training (p < 0.001) and test cohort (p = 0.002). ROC analysis also confirmed that lncRNA signature in this study posed more accurate prediction roles for eBCR occurrence when compared with PSA, TNM stages and Gleason scores. Drug sensitivity analysis further discovered that various drugs could be potentially utilized to treat high-risk samples in this study. ConclusionsThe m6A lncRNA signature in this study could be utilized to efficiently predict eBCR occurrence, various clinical characteristic and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04040-y.","PurposeIn a previous study, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type (PTPN) 3 was identified as an immune checkpoint molecule in lymphocytes, and its potential as a novel target for cancer immunotherapy was anticipated. However, evaluation of dendritic cell (DC) function as antigen-presenting cells is critical for the development of immunotherapy. In this study, we aimed to analyze the biological effect of PTPN3 on DCs induced from human peripheral blood monocytes obtained from healthy individuals.MethodsWe used short-interfering RNA to knock down PTP3 in DCs. For DC maturation, we added cancer cell lysate and tumor necrosis factor-α/interferon-α to immature DCs. In the cytotoxic assay, the target cancer cells were SBC5, unmatched with DCs from healthy human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24, or Sq-1, matched with DCs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the amount of cytokines. To examine the intracellular signaling system, intracellular staining was used.ResultsPTPN3 knockdown significantly increased the number of DCs, expression of CD80 and chemokine receptor (CCR)7, and production of interleukin-12p40/p70 in mature DCs. In the HLA-A24-restricted DC and human lung squamous cell carcinoma cell cytotoxic assay, inhibition of PTPN3 expression in mature DCs induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes with increased production of INF-γ and granzyme B, and enhanced toxicity against cancer cells and migration to cancer. Furthermore, inhibition of PTPN3 expression activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in DCs. ConclusionBased on our findings, inhibition of PTPN3 expression could contribute to the development of novel cancer immunotherapies that activate not only lymphocytes but also DCs.",1
