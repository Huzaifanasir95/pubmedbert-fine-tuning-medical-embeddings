"ObjectiveImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been validated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, there exists no evidence regarding NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, experiencing EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment failure. We collected clinical information from real world and conducted a time series-based meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations and experienced EGFR-TKIs resistance.MethodsTwenty-two NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations after TKI resistance were included from two hospitals. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literature published until December 31, 2021. Endpoint outcomes included mortality and progression-free survival (PFS) at different times of follow-up.ResultsIn total, 22 patients showed that the median PFS was 5.6 months (range 2.0–9.0 months). According to treatment strategies, the median PFS was 2.4 months (range 2.0–5.3 months) in the ICI monotherapy group and 5.9 months (range 2.8–9.0 months) in the ICI combined Chemotherapy group. Additionally, sixteen studies, including 5 trials, 10 controlled cohorts and 1 real-world study, were assessed, involving a total of ICI-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation after TKI failure. The 6-month survival and PFS rate were 0.82 (95% CI 0.36–0.97) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.34–0.74), respectively. ICI combined chemotherapy showed the best survival outcome among these groups, as demonstrated by the 12-month survival rate and PFS. No new safety signals were identified with the combination therapy. The frequency of treatment-related adverse events was similar to that in previously reported studies of chemotherapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors.ConclusionsThe addition of ICIs plus chemotherapy may significantly improve progression-free survival among patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who EGFR-TKIs resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04176-x.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been explored as first-line treatment in various types of previously untreatable malignancies, while limited evidence is available on the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients undergoing immunotherapy. We systematically reviewed data concerning challenges of hepatic adverse events including HBV reactivation and hepatitis in patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing immunotherapy.MethodsA systematic search was conducted in Medline, web of science, Embase and Cochrane library up to May 31, 2022. Studies reporting the safety profile of ICIs in patients with HBV infection were eligible. Meta-analyses were conducted to generate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsA total of 13 studies including 2561 patients were included for meta-analysis. The overall incidence rates of HBV reactivation in patients with chronic HBV infection and past HBV infection were 1.0% (95% CI 0–3%) and 0% (95% CI 0–0%), respectively. Among patients with chronic HBV infection, the incidence rates of HBV reactivation were 1.0% (95% CI 0–2%) and 10.0% (95% CI 4–18%) for patients with and without antiviral prophylaxis, respectively. Patients with chronic HBV infection were at a higher risk of HBV reactivation compared with those with past HBV infection [OR = 8.69, 95% CI (2.16–34.99)]. Antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of HBV reactivation [OR = 0.12, 95% CI (0.02–0.67)] and HBV-associated hepatitis [OR = 0.05, 95% CI (0.01–0.28)] in patients with chronic HBV infection.ConclusionsProphylactic antiviral therapy should be administered to patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing anticancer immunotherapy. Patients with past HBV infection are at lower risk of HBV reactivation compared with those with chronic HBV infection, they could be initiated with antiviral prophylaxis or monitored with the intent of on-demand antiviral therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04133-8.",1
"BackgroundCirrhosis is a serious condition characterized by the replacement of healthy liver tissue with scar tissue, which can progress to liver failure if left untreated. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a concerning complication of cirrhosis. It can be challenge to identify individuals with cirrhosis who are at high risk of developing HCC, particularly in the absence of known risk factors.MethodsIn this study, statistical and bioinformatics methods were utilized to construct a protein–protein interaction network and identify disease-related hub genes. We analyzed two hub genes, CXCL8 and CCNB1, and developed a mathematical model to predict the likelihood of developing HCC in individuals with cirrhosis. We also investigated immune cell infiltration, functional analysis under ontology terms, pathway analysis, distinct clusters of cells, and protein–drug interactions.ResultsThe results indicated that CXCL8 and CCNB1 were associated with the development of cirrhosis-induced HCC. A prognostic model based on these two genes was able to predict the occurrence and survival time of HCC. In addition, the candidate drugs were also discovered based on our model.ConclusionThe findings offer the potential for earlier detection of cirrhosis-induced HCC and provide a new instrument for clinical diagnosis, prognostication, and the development of immunological medications. This study also identified distinct clusters of cells in HCC patients using UMAP plot analysis and analyzed the expression of CXCL8 and CCNB1 within these cells, indicating potential therapeutic opportunities for targeted drug therapies to benefit HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05004-6.","BackgroundThe High Mobility Group Nucleosomal Binding Domain 1 Gene (HMGN1) is crucial for epigenetic regulation. However, the specific function of HMGN1 in cancer development is unclear.MethodsRaw data on HMGN1 expression were procured from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), the University of Alabama- Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thereafter, the pan-cancer analysis was implemented to understand the HMGN1 expression patterns, prognostic value, and immunological features. Furthermore, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was executed via R language. In addition, the relationship between HMGN1 and the sensitivity of antitumor drugs was also determined. Finally, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were carried out.ResultsPan-cancer analysis revealed that HMGN1 was upregulated in several solid tumors and was associated with pathological staging and poor prognosis. In addition, HMGN1 was found to be involved in regulating the tumor microenvironment. The GSEA enrichment analysis indicated that HMGN1 assisted in the regulation of oncogenic processes, especially metabolic and immune pathways. Furthermore, HMGN1 expression was linked to microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) across diverse tumor types. RT-PCR assays indicated that HMGN1 was overexpressed in the gastric and breast cancer cell lines and tissues.ConclusionThis study highlighted the potential of HMGN1 as a biomarker for pan-cancer analysis.",0

However, the etiology and mechanism behind this degradation are still ambiguous. The aim of the study was to explore the etiopathogenetic mechanism behind CC, along with its association with degree of differentiation, angiogenic, phagocytic and antiapoptotic activity in OSCC.DesignSeventy-three tissue sections of various histological grades of OSCC were retrieved from departmental archives and scanned for cannibalistic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using CD31, CD68, and BCL2 was performed. The data obtained were analyzed using Chi-square, Spearman’s correlation test and multiple regression analysis (p < 0.05).ResultsCCs were present significantly in various grades of OSCC (p < 0.00). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant difference in CD68, BCL2 (p < 0.05 in both), and CD31 (p < 0.001) expression with CC. The internalized cells showed positivity for CD68 and negativity for BCL2. Regression analysis revealed that tumor grade, CD31 and BCL2 immunoreactivity were significant predictors of frequency of CC.ConclusionThe association of CC with degree of differentiation, CD31, CD68, and BCL2 expression could predict the biological behavior of OSCC and might serve as a promising histopathological parameter in future.",1
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an immune-enriched subset of breast cancer that has recently demonstrated clinical responsiveness to combinatorial immunotherapy. However, the lack of targeted interventions against hormone receptors or HER2 continues to limit treatment options for these patients. To begin expanding available interventions for patients with metastatic TNBC, we previously reported a therapeutic vaccine regimen that significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastases in a pre-clinical TNBC model. This heterologous vaccine approach “primed” mice with tumor lysate antigens encapsulated within poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid microparticles (PLGA MPs) then “boosted” mice with tumor lysates plus adjuvant. The use of the PLGA MP prime as monotherapy demonstrated no efficacy, suggesting that improving this component of our therapy would achieve greater vaccine efficacy. Here, we functionally improved the PLGA MP prime by coating microparticles with biotinylated streptavidin-conjugated using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminoproplyl) carbodiimide/ N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/Sulfo-NHS) linkers. This modification enhanced the immunostimulatory potential of our PLGA MPs, as evidenced by increased phagocytosis, maturation, and stimulatory ligand expression of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Therapeutic prime/boost vaccination of TNBC-bearing mice with surfaced-coated PLGA MPs significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastases by an average of 56% relative to mice primed with unmodified PLGA MPs, and a significant 88% average reduction in spontaneous lung metastases relative to untreated control mice. These findings illustrate that relatively common biotin-streptavidin conjugation formulations can positively affect microparticle-based vaccine immunogenicity resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy against established pre-clinical mammary tumors.","Purpose:Neoadjuvant anti-PD-(L)1 therapy improves the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in unselected triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Given the potential for long-term morbidity from immune-related adverse events (irAEs), optimizing the risk-benefit ratio for these agents in the curative neoadjuvant setting is important. Suboptimal clinical response to initial neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is associated with low rates of pCR (2–5%) and may define a patient selection strategy for neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade. We conducted a single-arm phase II study of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel as the second phase of NAT in patients with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)-resistant TNBC (NCT02530489).Methods:Patients with stage I-III, AC-resistant TNBC, defined as disease progression or a <80% reduction in tumor volume after 4 cycles of AC, were eligible. Patients received atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3weeks x4) and nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2 IV,Q1 week x12) as the second phase of NAT before undergoing surgery followed by adjuvant atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3 weeks, x4). A two-stage Gehan-type design was employed to detect an improvement in pCR/residual cancer burden class I (RCB-I) rate from 5% to 20%.Results:From 2/15/2016 through 1/29/2021, 37 patients with AC-resistant TNBC were enrolled. The pCR/RCB-I rate was 46%. No new safety signals were observed. Seven patients (19%) discontinued atezolizumab due to irAEs.Conclusion:This study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a promising signal of activity in this high-risk population (pCR/RCB-I=46% vs 5% in historical controls), suggesting that a response-adapted approach to the utilization of neoadjuvant immunotherapy should be considered for further evaluation in a randomized clinical trial.",1
"AbstractIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas, comprising both astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, represent a distinct group of tumors that pose an interdisciplinary challenge. Addressing the needs of affected patients requires close collaboration among various disciplines, including neuropathology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery, radiation oncology, neurology, medical oncology, and other relevant specialties when necessary. Interdisciplinary tumor boards are central in determining the ideal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these patients. The key tasks of a tumor board include the evaluation of imaging findings, selecting the appropriate surgical approach, discussing additional treatment options, and identification/determination of tumor recurrence and progression. In addition to established treatments such as radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy, patients with an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant glioma for whom additional treatment is indicated may now also have the option of receiving treatment with an mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitor such as vorasidenib or ivosidenib. In this regard, the collaborative nature of tumor boards becomes even more crucial for evaluating comprehensively the needs of these patients. Through interdisciplinary discussions, tumor boards aim to develop personalized treatment strategies that maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing potential side effects and preserving patients’ quality of life.","AbstractThe clinical efficacy of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors in the treatment of patients with grade 2 IDH-mutant (mIDH) gliomas is a significant therapeutic advancement in neuro-oncology. It expands treatment options beyond traditional radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, which may lead to significant long-term neurotoxic effects while extending patient survival. The INDIGO study demonstrated that vorasidenib, a pan-mIDH inhibitor, improved progression-free survival for patients with grade 2 mIDH gliomas following surgical resection or biopsy compared to placebo and was well tolerated. However, these encouraging results leave a wake of unanswered questions: Will higher-grade mIDH glioma patients benefit? When is the appropriate timing to start and stop treatment? Where does this new treatment option fit in with other treatment modalities? In this study, we review the limited data available to start addressing these questions, provide a framework of how to discuss these gaps with current patients, and highlight what is needed from the neuro-oncology community for more definitive answers.",1
"PurposeItraconazole is an antifungal drug that has been clinically used for over 30 years. In recent years, scholars have discovered that it possesses an anticancer effect. Moreover, its mechanism has been clarified to some degree. What deserves to be mentioned is that itraconazole acting on the Hedgehog pathway has made a new progress in the treatment of cancers. While interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the Hedgehog pathway is largely activated in different cancer cells.ResultThis review tries to highlight the effect of itraconazole on smoothened receptor (SMO) in the Hedgehog pathway, thereby reducing the glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) release and finally exhibiting a range of anticancer effects, promoting apoptosis of cancer cells, and inhibiting proliferation by indirect inhibition of NF-κB pathway and inflammation, moreover, promoting the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, inhibiting the expression of target genes transcribed by GLI such as BCL-2 and Cyclin-D1. Besides, itraconazole increases the number of Bnip3, subsequently, inducing the dissociation of the Beclin-1/BCL-2 binding complex, as a result of ultimately promoting autophagy of cancer cells.ConclusionAs a new anticancer drug, whether itraconazole eventually entering clinical application requires the joint eforts of all scholars. In any case, an in-depth study on itraconazole will bring new hope for cancer patients in the near future.","This Pillars of Immunology article is a commentary on “A subset of CD4+ thymocytes selected by MHC class I molecules,” a pivotal article by A.

"BackgroundPlatelets are essential for hemostasis, and thrombosis, and play vital roles during metastatic cancer progression and infection. Hallmarks of platelet function are activation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and the degranulation of their cellular contents upon stimulation. While alpha and dense granules are the most studied platelet secretory granules, the dense tubular system (DTS) also functions as a secretory system for vascular thiol isomerases. However, how DTS cargo is packaged and transported from megakaryocytes (MKs) to platelets is poorly understood.Objectives:To underpin the mechanisms responsible for DTS cargo transport and leverage those for therapeutic protein packaging into platelets.MethodsA retroviral expression system combined with immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was employed to track protein DTS cargo protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) fused to eGFP (eGFP-PDI) during platelet production. Murine bone marrow transplantation models were used to determine the release of therapeutic proteins from platelets.Results and conclusionsWe demonstrated that the endoplasmic reticulum retrieval motif Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) located at the C-terminus of PDI was essential for the regular transport of eGFP-PDI-containing granules. eGFP-PDIΔKDEL, in which the retrieval signal was deleted, was aberrantly packaged and its expression was upregulated within clathrin-coated endosomes. Finally, we found that ectopic transgenic proteins, such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor and interleukin 2, can be packaged into MKs and proplatelets by adding a KDEL retrieval sequence. Our data corroborate the DTS as a non-canonical secretory system in platelets and demonstrate that in vitro-generated MKs and platelets may be used as a delivery system for transgenic proteins during cellular therapy.","Background and aimAccording to previous reports, GTPase of immunity-associated protein 6 (GIMAP6) is essential for autophagy. However, it is unclear how GIMAP6 affects the development and tumor immunity of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).MethodsIn the present study, the role of GIMAP6 in vivo and in vitro was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting, and Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and Transwell assays. Datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were thoroughly analyzed using R software. A nomogram was created using GIMAP6 and prognostic characteristics. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were applied to explore the potential mechanism of GIMAP6 in lung cancer. The link between GIMAP6 and the immunological landscape was studied using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0 and Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub.ResultsPatients with high GIMAP6 expression had improved overall and disease-specific survival compared with those patients with low GIMAP6 expression. According to the receiver operating characteristic and calibration curve, the nomogram based on T stage, N stage and GIMAP6 had predictive value for prognosis. According to functional enrichment analysis, GIMAP6 was primarily involved in T-cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction. GIMAP6 was shown to be favorably linked with the infiltration of immune cells and immune-related molecules, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, programmed death-ligand 1, and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, by single-cell sequencing and TIMER2.0 analysis. The role of GIMAP6 in lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and immunity was experimentally verified.ConclusionThese findings confirmed that GIMAP6 was an effective prognostic molecule that was involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment of LUAD, and may become a predictor for the efficacy of immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04980-z.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundTumoral melanosis (TM) is a histological term to describe a nodular aggregation of macrophages containing melanin pigment (melanophages) that is devoid of viable melanocytes. It is most often identified in skin, where it may be appreciated clinically as a pigmented lesion; however, it can also be found in other organs such as lymph nodes. The presence of TM is usually thought to signify the presence of a regressed melanoma or other pigmented tumor. Until recently, it was a relatively uncommon finding; however, with the use of effective systemic therapies against melanoma, its occurrence in histological specimens is more frequent.MethodsWe identified and reviewed all histopathological diagnoses of TM at any organ site reported at a single institution from 2006 to 2018. TM cases were paired with non‐TM cases of cutaneous melanoma through propensity score matching at a 1:2 ratio, and their survival outcomes were compared. The clinical outcomes examined included recurrence‐free survival (RFS), distant disease‐free survival (DDFS), melanoma‐specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).ResultsTM was reported in 79 patients. Their median age was 65 years (range 22–88), with a 2:1 male predominance (51 out of 79, 65%). The most common organ involved was the skin (67%), with a third of all cases localized to a lower limb (36%). TM had a strong association with the presence of melanoma (91%) and regression at other sites of melanoma (54%), suggesting that it is part of a systemic immune response against melanoma. Most patients with TM either previously or subsequently developed histologically confirmed melanoma in the same anatomical region as the TM (89%). Thirty‐five TM patients were matched with 70 non‐TM cases. Patients with melanoma who developed TM without prior regional or systemic therapy showed improved MSS (p = 0.03), whereas no statistically significant differences were observed in terms of RFS, DDFS, and OS.ConclusionsTM usually occurs in the context of a previous or subsequent cutaneous melanoma and is associated with improved MSS. It is important that TM is recognized by pathologists and documented in pathology reports.","ABSTRACTCancer is increasingly being recognized as a global health issue with considerable unmet medical need. Despite the rapid progression of anticancer pharmaceuticals, there are still significant challenges for the effective management of cancer. In many circumstances, cancer cells are difficult to detect and treat. Combination of nanovesicles (NVs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), referred as magnetic nanovesicles (MNVs), is now well recognized as a potential theranostic option for improving cancer treatment outcomes and reducing adverse effects. MNVs can be used for monitoring the long-term fate and functional benefits of cancer therapy. Moreover, MNV-mediated hyperthermia mechanism has been explored as a potential technique for triggering cancer cell death, and/or controlled release of laden cargo. In this review, we focus on the unique characteristics of MNVs as a promising avenue for targeted drug delivery, diagnosis, and treatments of cancer or tumor. Moreover, we discuss critical considerations related to the issues raised in this area, which will guide future research toward better anti-cancer therapeutics for clinical applications.",1
"Background:There is limited data regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for cN3b patients, who present with both axillary and ipsilateral internal mammary node involvement. We examined trends in the use of SLNB in cN3b patients and survival by axillary procedure for those with nodal pathologic complete response (nPCR).Methods:Adult women with non-metastatic cN3b invasive breast carcinoma between 2012 and 2021 were selected from the National Cancer Database. These patients were compared based on type of axillary surgery, specifically SLNB, SLNB with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and ALND alone. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare overall survival.Results:4,236 patients were included. In 2012, 8.5% of these patients underwent SLNB alone and 18.3% underwent SLNB+ALND. In 2021, this increased to 35.1% for SLNB alone and 23.0% for SLNB with subsequent ALND (p<0.0001). For patients who received NAC, the rate of nPCR was overall found to be 24.9%. Overall survival of patients receiving SLNB or SLNB+ALND with nPCR was not statistically significantly different from the ALND only group with nPCR (p=0.22 and 0.57, respectively).Conclusions:There has been increasing use of the SLNB procedure for patients with cN3b breast cancer over the past decade. In patients with nPCR, SLNB was not associated with reduced survival. For well-selected cN3b patients with an excellent clinical response to NAC including nPCR, axillary de-escalation strategies, such as SLNB with omission of completion axillary dissection, may be considered.","The potential of camel milk-derived exosomes (CMDE) to enhance the bioavailability of Cannabidiol (CBD) was investigated. CBD-CMDE formulation was prepared using an established procedure and its particle size was 138.4 ± 4.37 nm, and CBD entrapment efficiency of 56.56 ± 4.26 %. In-vitro release studies showed release of 78.27 ± 5.37 % and 46.42 ± 4.75 % CBD from CMDE and control CBD formulation respectively in pH 6.8 at 24 hr. The apparent permeability (Papp) of CBD-CMDE was found to be enhanced by 3.95-fold with Papp of 22.9*10−6 ± 0.34 cm/sec as compared to control CBD formulation with Papp of 5.8*10−6 ± 0.65 cm/sec in MDCK cells. CBD-CMDE was found to be more potent than CBD in 2D cytotoxicity assay with IC50 values of 3.6 ± 0.54 μM, 3.88 ± 0.54 μM and 7.53 ± 0.59 μM, 7.53 ± 0.59 μM against Doxorubicin (DOX) resistant MDA-MB-231 and Rapamycin (RM) resistant MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells respectively. Moreover, 3D spheroids assay results demonstrated CBD-CMDE with IC50 values of 14 ± 0.85 μM, 15 ± 0.07 μM as compared to CBD alone with IC50 values of 25 ± 0.93 μM, 34.7 ± 0.08 μM in MDA-MB-231 DOX RT cells and MDA-MB-468 RM RT cells respectively. In-vivo PK studies showed enhanced bioavailability of CBD from CBD-exosomes with AUC(0–24h) of 1350.56 ± 187.50 h.ng/mL as compared to CBD control formulation with AUC(0–24h) of 351.95 ± 39.10 h.ng/mL with a single oral dose of 12 mg/kg. The data indicate that CMDE significantly improved the oral bioavailability of CBD. Overall, CMDE can be used to enhance the oral absorption of poorly bioavailable APIs.",0
"BackgroundThe m6A methylation modification is one of the most common mRNA modifications, and involved in a variety of biological processes, such as cell death, cancer stem cell formation and tumorigenesis. Increasing evidences have demonstrated that the expression patterns of m6A regulators are significantly correlated with PD-L1 level some solid tumors, but few study has explored the function of m6A regulators in the immune microenvironment and prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsSurvival analysis was independently conducted for 20 m6A regulators to explore their prognostic value in NSCLC, and then the prognostic risk model based on m6A regulator expression profiles is built to stratify NSCLC patients. Also, the correlation analysis between immune infiltrating cells and m6A regulators is used to reveal the impact of m6A on immune microenvironment of NSCLC. Furthermore, to explore the function of m6A as biomarker of anit-PD-L1 therapeutic effect, we explored the associations of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1 levels to 20 m6A regulator expression patterns in NSCLC.ResultsFirst, the expressions of 20 m6A regulators in NSCLC tissues were significantly increased compared to normal tissues. Survival analysis revealed that three genes, METTL3, HNRNPC and VIRMA, were markedly correlated to the prognosis of NSCLC patients. In particular, cox regression analysis verified that METTL3 could be used as an independent prognostic factor to predict the survival rate of NSCLC patients. Second, the risk prognostic model built on seven m6A regulators can effectively stratify NSCLC patients, and the low-risk subgroup had better prognosis compared to high-risk group. Finally, a few m6A regulators showed significant associations with immune microenvironment, as well as TMB and PD-L1 level, suggesting that the m6A RNA methylation is indicative of therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 treatment.ConclusionOur study identified some m6A regulatory factors as independent risk factors for the prognosis of NSCLC, and the expression patterns of m6A regulators are also correlated to the immune infiltration, as well as TMB and PD-L1 level in NSCLC. The m6A regulators could be used as biomarkers indicative of immunotherapy to NSCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04032-y.","BackgroundDisulfidptosis, as a new mode of programmed cell death, is closely associated with tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, M2 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) plays an important role in tumor progression. Here, we propose to combine these two perspectives to detect novel disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related biomarkers in bladder cancer (BCa) to identify various tumor subtypes, construct prognostic features, reveal immune and somatic mutational landscapes, and screen for drugs in BCa.MethodsWe used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to mine M2 TAM-related genes. Consensus unsupervised clustering was performed to identify potential tumor subtypes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to build the risk model. We then explored the immune cell, immune function, immune checkpoint expression patterns and somatic mutational landscape in clusters and risk groups. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis for anti-cancer drugs.ResultsWe identified 3057 M2 TAM-related genes and intersected them with disulfidptosis-related genes to obtain 95 disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related genes (DMRGs). In terms of tumor subtypes, two molecular clusters were identified. Cluster 1 showed stronger immunogenicity and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). We also predicted 50 drugs with high sensitivity in cluster 1. On the basis of risk grouping, the high-risk group had poor overall survival in the training, test, and validation groups. Ten screened anti-cancer drugs were more sensitive in the high-risk group. A nomogram predicting survival of BCa patients was also established.ConclusionBy combining two hotspot perspectives, disulfidptosis and M2 TAM, we provide a valuable risk score signature for establishing individualized treatment regimens and drug choices. The risk score may serve as an independent risk factor for BCa patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05352-3.",1
"BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundAlthough targeted therapies and immunotherapy have achieved significant clinical benefits in patients with certain pathological types of lung cancer. However, prognosis for patients with lung adenocarcinoma still remains unsatisfactory. It is of extremely importance to find ideal prognostic indicators to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients, especially for patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the significance of Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1) and Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.MethodsIn this study, IGFR1 and VEGF-A expression on 119 specimens of patients early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed by immunohistochemistry with an H-score system.ResultsBoth high IGFR1 expression and VEGF-A expression patients were resulted in 59 (49.6%) separately. The numbers and proportions of IGFR1−&VEGF-A− subgroup, IGFR1−&VEGF-A+ subgroup, IGFR1+&VEGF-A− subgroup and IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ subgroup are 23 (19.3%), 37 (31.1%), 37 (31.1%) and 22 (18.5%) respectively. High IGFR1 expression was significantly associated with both poor PFS and OS of all patients in a univariate analysis. Multivariable analysis showed that patients with IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ expression exhibited a worst PFS and OS in the subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutation.ConclusionsThese results suggest that IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ is expected to be a disadvantageous factor for prognosis in the subgroup of EGFR mutation in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. What’s more, this study may provide the theoretical possibility to screen optimal population for a combination therapy with anti-VEGF and anti-IGFR1 in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05371-0.",1
"PurposeWe aimed to establish the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) in the East Asian population.MethodsOverall survival (OS) and intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to determine prognostic factors associated with intracranial PFS and OS.ResultsBetween July 2007 and December 2019, 431 patients diagnosed with MBM were enrolled. Mucosal subtype (p = 0.013), LDH level (p = 0.014), the number of MBM ≥ 4 (p = 0.02), local treatment (p < 0.0001) and the use of PD-1 inhibitors (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for intracranial PFS. Mucosal subtype (p = 0.022), LDH level (p = 0.005), no extracranial metastasis (p = 0.01), concurrent liver metastasis (p = 0.004), local treatment (p = 0.001) and the use of PD-1 inhibitors (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for OS. Mucosal subtype brain metastases had a poor response to PD-1 inhibitors (p = 0.007), with a shorter intracranial PFS than other subtypes. In BRAF mutation patients with MBM, the first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy group had an advantage in OS compared to the first-line anti-PD-1 therapy group (p = 0.043).ConclusionOur findings depict clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of MBM in the East Asian population, suggesting the mucosal subtype as an adverse prognostic and predictive factor for patients with MBM. For BRAF mutation patients with MBM, first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy may bring a potential survival benefit compared to first-line anti-PD-1 therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03563-0.","PurposeThe low objective response of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a great challenge in advanced melanoma therapy. Interferon-alpha has been proven to be a promising combination regimen with ICI in a phase Ib/II trial. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of interferon-alpha 1b plus PD-1 monoantibody in a real-world Chinese metastatic melanoma cohort.MethodsProfiles of patients diagnosed with unresectable stage IV (AJCC 8th Edition) between December 1st, 2018 and February 28th, 2022 from the Department of Dermatology, Xijing Hospital were reviewed. All of them received the combination treatment of interferon-alpha 1b (600 μg every other day) plus PD-1 monoantibody (Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or Toripalimab 240 mg or Sintilimab 200 mg, every 3 weeks) for at least 12 weeks. The efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V1.1). The safety data were identified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) V.5.0.ResultsIn total, 70 patients were included. 50% were females. 52.9% were with ECOG performance status ≥ 1. The fraction of patients receiving Pembrolizumab, Toripalimab, and Sintilimab was 28.6%, 67.1%, and 4.3%, respectively. Acral and mucosal subtypes accounted for 48.6% and 20%. The median follow-up period is 15.1 months. The objective response rate was 32.8%. The median time of overall survival was 18 months (95% CI 14.2–21.8 months), and the median time of PFS was 5.2 months (95% CI 4.2–6.2 months). The incidence of adverse events (any grade) was 98.6%, but only 8.6% of cases experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions.ConclusionThe combination of interferon-alpha 1b and PD-1 monoantibody demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects and acceptable toxicity in Chinese metastatic melanoma patients with cutaneous, acral, and mucosal subtypes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04596-3.",1
"BackgroundThe CD-TK double suicide gene has become an effective therapy for bladder cancer. A novel molecular-targeted ultrasound (US) method has been developed to precisely guide nanobubbles loaded with this gene to regions within bladder tumor cells and is widely used due to its efficiency in delivering drugs to the target tumor.MethodsUniform nanoscaled nanobubbles loaded with CD-TK double suicide gene were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods.ResultsIn the present study, we synthesized CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded cationic nanobubbles conjugated with anti-VEGFR2 that can bind with VEGFR2-positive cells. Fluorescence and flow cytometry evidence show that CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded nanobubbles were successfully developed. CD-TK-CNBs delivered via US-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) enhanced transfection efficiency, overexpression of CD-TK double suicide gene, and tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro.ConclusionsThese CD-TK-CNBs may become a novel treatment for bladder cancer.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",0
"AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.","AbstractRationaleHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.Eligibility criteriaParallel‐group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross‐over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi‐randomised trials for analysis.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non‐serious.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta‐analysed the outcome data at the longest follow‐up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random‐effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.Included studiesWe included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single‐centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia‐Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co‐interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information.The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow‐up was three months to five years.Synthesis of resultsTen trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions.Eight trials evaluated all‐cause mortality at varied follow‐up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow‐up periods taken together.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one‐year follow‐up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events.One trial measured health‐related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow‐up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health‐related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health‐related quality of life scores. No further data were provided.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non‐serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non‐serious.We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.We identified no ongoing trials.Authors' conclusionsBased on the low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all‐cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events considered non‐serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationProtocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014869.",1
"AbstractBackgroundGlutamine is an important nutrient for cancer cell growth that provides biological sources for nucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis, but the role of glutaminolysis in signal transduction and glioblastoma (GBM) progression remains little known.MethodsKnockdown and overexpression cells were obtained to explore the functional roles of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) in cell proliferation, tumor formation, and aerobic glycolysis. RNA-seq, Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase assay, and western blot were performed to verify the regulation of the EGFR-AKT pathway by the GDH1 (also known as GLUD1) and KDM6A. Metabolite-level measurements and Seahorse Assay were performed to assess the functional role of GHD1 in reprogramming glycolysis.ResultsHere, we report that GDH1 catalytic glutaminolysis is essential for GBM cell line proliferation and brain tumorigenesis even in high-glucose conditions. Glutamine is metabolized through glutaminolysis to produce α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). We demonstrate that glutamine in combination with leucine activates mammalian TORC1 by enhancing glutaminolysis and α-KG production. α-KG increases the transcription of PDPK1 by reducing the suppressive histone modification H3K27me3 and then promotes the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This transcriptional activation induced by α-KG requires histone demethylase KDM6A, which is a 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase that plays an important role in converting α-KG to succinate. Furthermore, we show that GDH1-catalytic glutaminolysis also increases the expression of HK2 and promotes glycolysis in high-glucose conditions dependent on KDM6A-mediated demethylation of H3K27.ConclusionsThese findings suggest a novel function of glutaminolysis in the regulation of signal transduction and metabolism reprogramming and provide further evidence for the unique role of glutaminolysis in GBM progression.","AbstractBackgroundGlutamine is an important nutrient for cancer cell growth that provides biological sources for nucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis, but the role of glutaminolysis in signal transduction and glioblastoma (GBM) progression remains little known.MethodsKnockdown and overexpression cells were obtained to explore the functional roles of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) in cell proliferation, tumor formation, and aerobic glycolysis.

"Adjuvants for vaccines with characteristics of improving adaptive immunity particularly via leverage of antigen presenting cells (APCs) are currently lacking. In a previous work we obtained a new soluble 300 kDa homogeneous β-glucan named GFPBW1 from the fruit bodies of Granola frondosa. GFPBW1 could activate macrophages by targeting dendritic cell associated C-type lectin 1 (Dectin-1)/Syk/NF-κB signaling to achieve antitumour effects. In this study the adjuvant effects of GFPBW1 were explored with OVA-antigen and B16-OVA tumor model. We showed that GFPBW1 (5, 50, 500 μg/mL) dose-dependently promoted activation and maturation of APCs in vitro by increasing CD80, CD86 and MHC II expression. We immunized female mice with OVA in combination with GFPBW1 (50 or 300 μg) twice with an interval of two weeks. GFPBW1 markedly and dose-dependently increased OVA-specific antibody titers of different subtypes including IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, suggesting that it could serve as an adjuvant for both Th1 and Th2 type immune responses. Furthermore, GFPBW1 in combination with aluminum significantly increased the titers of OVA-specific IgG2a and IgG2b, but not those of IgG1, suggesting that GFPBW1 could be used as a co-adjuvant of aluminum to compensate for Th1 deficiency. For mice immunized with OVA plus GFPBW1, no obvious pathological injury was observed in either major organs or injection sites, and no abnormalities were noted for any of the hematological parameters. When GFPBW1 served as an adjuvant in the B16-OVA cancer vaccine models, it could accomplish entire tumor suppression with preventive vaccines, and enhance antitumour efficacy with therapeutic vaccines. Differentially expressed genes were found to be enriched in antigen processing process, specifically increased tumor infiltration of DCs, B1 cells and plasma cells in the OVA plus GFPBW1 group, in accordance with its activation and maturation function of APCs. Collectively, this study systematically describes the properties of GFPBW1 as a novel potent and safe adjuvant and highlights its great potential in vaccine development.","Recombinant protein vaccines offer an advantage without a safety risk in eliciting desired humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against infectious diseases. But one of their disadvantages is their low immunogenicity, thus requiring adjuvants that augment their immunogenicity. It is necessary to explore new technology that could provide a non-toxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible delivery system with adjuvant characteristics and nanotechnology provides an excellent platform for nanomaterial-based vaccine adjuvants. Here, we have synthesized a modified dipeptide, Arg-α, β-dehydrophenyalanine (RΔF) containing ΔF at its C-terminal, and characterized it using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and mass spectrometry techniques. RΔF upon its self-assembly to spherical nanoparticles (NPs) efficiently condensed a recombinant Plasmodium falciparum surface protein, histidine-tagged MSPFu24 (Fu24H). The morphological characteristics of the nanoparticle formulation was characterized using TEM. RΔF NPs and RΔF-Fu24H complex showed excellent in vitro biocompatibility toward two mammalian cell lines and human red blood cells (RBCs). Furthermore, mice treated with R∆F NPs showed histological and haematological properties similar to the untreated control group which indicated their very high in vivo biocompatibility. Mice treated with RΔF-Fu24H nanoformulation induced a high titers of anti-Fu24H specific antibodies and showed a mixed Th1 and Th2 profile, comparable to the FDA-approved adjuvant Alhydrogel®. The sera from immunized mice inhibited the erythrocyte invasion activity of P. falciparum’s laboratory line 3D7 in vitro which was comparable to that of Alhydrogel®. The present study suggests that the highly biocompatible dipeptide-based nanoparticle formulation can further be developed and used in clinic as a promising antigen delivery platform to elicit immune responses.",1
"Cisplatin resistance is one of the major causes of treatment failure in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There is an urgent need to uncover the underlying mechanism for developing effective treatment strategies. A quantitative proteomics assay was used to identify differential proteins in cisplatin-resistant cells. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I (TOP1MT) localization was determined using laser confocal microscopy and nucleocytoplasmic separation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to identify the interaction between pseudogenes, miRNAs, and real genes. In vivo experiments verified the interaction between TOP1MT and pseudogenes on cisplatin resistance. TOP1MT was identified as a driving factor of cisplatin resistance in vitro, in vivo, and in HNSCC patients. Moreover, TOP1MT exceptionally translocated to the nucleus in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells in a signal peptide–dependent manner. Nuclear TOP1MT (nTOP1MT) transcriptionally regulated the mitochondrial functional pseudogene MTATP6P1, which bound to miR-137 and miR-491-5p as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and promoted the expression of MTATP6. An increase in MTATP6 enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which conferred cisplatin resistance in HNSCC. Our findings revealed that nTOP1MT transcriptionally activated MTAPT6P1 and increased MTATP6 expression via ceRNA, which facilitated OXPHOS and cisplatin resistance. These results provide novel insight for overcoming cisplatin resistance in HNSCC.","Aim: Certain cancer cells depend on oxidative phosphorylation for survival; thus, inhibiting this process may be a promising treatment strategy. This study explored the structure–activity relationships of the mitochondrial inhibitor N-ethylene glycol-comprising alkyl thiophene-3-carboxamide 3.Methods & results: We synthesized and evaluated 13 analogs (5a–m) with different ethylene glycol units, heterocycles and connecting groups for their growth-inhibitory effects on A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells. We found that increasing the number of ethylene glycol units significantly enhanced inhibitory activity. Some analogs activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, similar to 3. Notably, analog 5e, which contains tetraethylene glycol units, significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo.Conclusion: Analog 5 may be a potential therapeutic agent for non-small cell lung cancer treatment.",1
"PurposeThe current evaluation methods for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly CD8 + TILs, mainly rely on semiquantitative immunohistochemistry with high variability. We aimed to construct an individualized DNA methylation-based signature for CD8 + TILs (CD8 + MeTIL) that may characterize melanoma immune microenvironment and guide therapeutic selection.MethodsThe transcriptome profiles and DNA methylation data of 457 melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed. Differential methylation analysis between groups with high and low CD8 + TILs was performed to select differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and define CD8 + MeTIL. The prognostic value of CD8 + MeTIL and its predictive value for immunotherapy response were investigated using multiple melanoma cohorts.ResultsWe successfully constructed the CD8 + MeTIL signature based on four DMPs. The survival analyses showed that higher CD8 + MeTIL score was associated with worse survival outcomes in TCGA-SKCM and GSE144487 cohorts. The ROC curve for the predictive analysis revealed that the survival prediction of CD8 + MeTIL score was superior compared with CD8 + TILs (CIBERSORT) and CD8B mRNA expression. Furthermore, we founded that tumors with higher CD8 + MeTIL score were marked with immunosuppressive characteristics, including low immune score and downregulated immune-related pathways. More importantly, the CD8 + MeTIL score showed a potential predictive value for the benefit from immunotherapy in two published cohorts. When combined CD8 + MeTIL with PD-L1 expression, the patient classification showed significantly different immunotherapy response rates and long-term survival outcomes.ConclusionsThe CD8 + MeTIL signature might be as a novel method to evaluate CD8 + TILs and guide immunotherapy approaches.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04566-1.","PurposeTo explore the feasibility and performance of machine learning-based radiomics models in predicting thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsA total of 227 NSCLC patients were included in this retrospective study and divided into the training set and test set with a ratio of 8:2 randomly.

Variance threshold (VT), principal component analysis (PCA), and least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) were used to reduce features; logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to develop classifier, respectively. The performance of the models was evaluated by areas under the curves (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Different models were compared by the Delong test to determine the optimal algorithms.ResultsTotal 1968 radiomic features were extracted from the lung tumors images, and then 13, 15, and 13 stable features were selected by VT, PCA, and LASSO, respectively. Each classifier could discriminate against the TTF-1-positive groups with average AUC ranging from 0.601 to 0.784 in the training set. Among the models, three models constructed by the LASSO method showed satisfactory performance in the test set with AUC ranging from 0.715 to 0.787. The Delong test showed no significant difference between the LASSO models (P > 0.05).ConclusionMachine learning-based radiomics model could predict the expression of TTF-1 in NSCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04357-8.",1
"IntroductionThe best first-line treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child–Pugh (CP) class B remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to perform a real-world analysis on a large sample of patients with unresectable HCC with CP B treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Vs Lenvatinib.MethodsThe study population included patients affected by advanced (BCLC-C) or intermediate (BCLC-B) HCC patients not suitable for locoregional therapies from both the Western and Eastern world (Italy, Germany, Republic of Korea and Japan), who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or Lenvatinib as first-line treatment. All the study population presented a CP class of B. The primary endpoint of the study was the overall survival (OS) of CP B patients treated with Lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Survival curves were estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan–Meier. The role of stratification factors was analyzed with log-rank tests. Finally, an interaction test was performed for the main baseline clinical characteristics.Results217 CP B HCC patients were enrolled in the study: 65 (30%) received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, and 152 (70%) received lenvatinib. The mOS for patients receiving Lenvatinib was 13.8 months (95% CI: 11.6–16.0), compared to 8.2 months (95% CI 6.3–10.2) for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Vs Lenvatinib: HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.0, p = 0.0050). No statistically significant differences were highlighted in terms of mPFS. The multivariate analysis confirmed that patients receiving Lenvatinib as first-line treatment have a significantly longer OS compared to patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.29–3.25, p = 0.0023). By evaluating the cohort of patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, we found that Child B patients with ECOG PS 0, or BCLC B stage or ALBI grade 1 were those who had benefited from the treatment thus showing survival outcomes no significantly different compared to those receiving Lenvatinib.ConclusionThe present study suggests for the first time a major benefit from Lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in a large cohort of patients with CP B class HCC.","The immune system requires a complex network of specialized cell types to defend against a range of threats. The specific roles and destinies of these cell types are enforced by a constellation of gene regulatory programs, which are orchestrated through lineage-specifying transcription factors. T Cell Factor 1 (TCF1) is a central transcription factor in many of these programs, guiding the development and functionality of both adaptive and innate lymphoid cells. This review highlights recent insights into the function of TCF1 in a variety of lymphoid cell subsets and its potential for translational applications in immune disorders and cancer.",0
"As one of the most prevalent malignancies, lung cancer displays considerable biological variability in both molecular and clinical characteristics. Lung cancer is broadly categorized into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the latter being most prevalent. The primary histological subtypes of NSCLC are lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In the present work, we primarily extracted mRNA count data from a publicly accessible database followed by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed mitophagy-related genes (DEMRGs) identification in case of both LUAD and LUSC cohorts. Next, we identified important DEMRGs via clustering approach followed by enrichment, survival, and mutational analyses. Lastly, the finalized prognostic biomarker was validated using wet-lab experimentations. Primarily, we obtained 986 and 1714 DEGs across LUAD and LUSC cohorts. Only 7 DEMRGs from both cohorts had significant membership values as indicated by the clustering analysis. Most significant pathway, Gene Ontology (GO)-biological process (BP), GO-molecular function (MF), GO-cellular compartment (CC) terms were macroautophagy, GTP metabolic process, magnesium ion binding, mitochondrial outer membrane. Among all, only TDRKH reported significant overall survival (OS) and 14% amplification across LUAD patients. Lastly, we validated TDRKH via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In conclusion, our findings advocate for the exploration of TDRKH and their genetic alterations in precision oncology therapeutic approaches for LUAD, emphasizing the potential for target-driven therapy and early diagnostics.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-024-04127-y.","Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3) is a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein family expressed in the extracellular matrix closely associated with the development and occurrence of various malignant tumors; yet, its function in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is still poorly understood. The following study investigated the progress and mechanism of HAPLN3 on ccRCC using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments. In order to determine whether HAPLN3 is differentially expressed in ccRCC, we analyzed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE40435 and further validated them in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Simultaneously, the TCGA dataset was utilized to study the relationship between HAPLN3 expression and the progression of ccRCC and its prognostic value in ccRCC. Gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore HAPLN3-related signaling pathways in ccRCC. The TIMER database investigates the link for both HAPLN3 and immune cell infiltration. Different ccRCC cell lines the role of HAPLN3 on cell biological behavior in vitro. HAPLN3 was increased in ccRCC, and its high expression was related to the patients' survival rates and clinical characteristics. GSEA showed that HAPLN3 is mainly enriched in proliferative and metastatic pathways. In addition, HAPLN3 was an independently associated significant predictor in patients with ccRCC. Functional experiments demonstrated that HAPLN3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. To sum up, our data suggest that HAPLN3 may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.",1
"AbstractBackgroundThis study validates MRI-based tumor habitats in predicting time-to-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and progression sites in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma patients.MethodsSeventy-nine patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2020 and June 2022. MRI, including diffusion-weighted and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, were obtained immediately postoperation and at three serial timepoints. Voxels from cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were grouped into three habitats (hypervascular cellular, hypovascular cellular, and nonviable tissue) using k-means clustering. Predefined cutoffs for increases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitat were applied to calculate the habitat risk score. Associations between spatiotemporal habitats, habitat risk score, TTP, and OS were investigated using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Habitat risk score was compared to tumor volume using time-dependent receiver operating characteristics analysis. Progression sites were matched with spatial habitats.ResultsIncreases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitats and habitat risk scores were associated with shorter TTP and OS (all P < .05). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk scores 1 and 2 independently predicted TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 4.14; P = .03, HR, 4.51; P = .001 and HR, 10.02; P < .001, respectively). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk score 2 independently predicted OS (HR, 4.01, P = .003; and HR, 3.27, P < .001, respectively). Habitat risk score outperformed tumor volume in predicting TTP (12-month AUC, 0.762 vs. 0.646, P = .048). Hypovascular cellular habitat predicted progression sites (mean Dice index: 0.31).ConclusionsMultiparametric physiologic MRI-based spatiotemporal tumor habitats and habitat risk scores are useful biomarkers for early tumor progression and outcomes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients.","Heterotrimeric extracellular matrix proteins laminins are mostly deposited at basal membranes and are important in repair and neoplasia. Here, we localize laminin beta 2 (LAMB2) at the sites of blood–brain barrier (BBB). Microvasculature (MV) of normal brain is endowed with complete LAMB2 coverage. In contrast, its cognate protein laminin beta 1 (LAMB1) is absent in MV of normal brain but emerges at the sprouting tip of a growing vessels. Similarly, vascular proliferation in high-grade gliomas (HGG) is accompanied by marked overexpression of LAMB1, whereas LAMB2 shows deficient deposition. We find that many brain pathologies with presence of post-gadolinium enhancement (PGE) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show disruption of LAMB2 vascular ensheathment. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in HGG blocks angiogenesis, suppresses PGE in HGG, prevents expression of LAMB1, and restores LAMB2 vascular coverage. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases shows that in quiescent brain LAMB2 is predominantly expressed by BBB-associated pericytes (PCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), whereas neither cell types produce LAMB1. In contrast, in HGG, both LAMB1 and 2 are overexpressed by endothelial precursor cells, a phenotypically unique immature group, specific to proliferating hyperplastic MV.",1
"AbstractCentral to immune recognition is the glycocalyx, a glycan-rich coat on all cells that plays a crucial role in interactions that enable pathogen detection and activation of immune defenses. Pathogens and cancerous cells often display distinct glycans on their surfaces, making these saccharide antigens prime targets for vaccine development. However, carbohydrates alone generally serve as poor immunogens due to their often weak binding affinities, inability to effectively recruit T cell help, and reliance on adjuvants to iboost immune activation. The introduction of glycoconjugate vaccines, initially involving the covalent coupling of carbohydrate antigens to carrier proteins, marked a pivotal advancement by facilitating neutralizing antibody production against carbohydrate targets. Despite successes in generating glycoconjugate vaccines against certain bacterial diseases, challenges persist in creating effective vaccines against numerous intracellular pathogens and non-communicable diseases such as cancer. In this review, we highlight new developments in conjugate vaccine platforms aim to overcome these limitations by optimizing the display of glycan and T cell epitopes as well as incorporating defined carbohydrate adjuvants to direct tailored immune responses. These advancements promise to improve the effectiveness of carbohydrate-based vaccines and broaden their coverage against a wide range of diseases.","The immune system is highly regulated but, when dysregulated, suboptimal protective or overly robust immune responses can lead to immune-mediated disorders. The genetic and molecular mechanisms of immune regulation are incompletely understood, impeding the development of more precise diagnostics and therapeutics for immune-mediated disorders. Recently, thousands of previously unrecognized noncanonical microprotein genes encoded by small open reading frames have been identified. Many of these microproteins perform critical functions, often in a cell- and context-specific manner. Several microproteins are now known to regulate immunity; however, the vast majority are uncharacterized. Therefore, illuminating what is often referred to as the “dark proteome,” may present opportunities to tune immune responses more precisely. Here, we review noncanonical microprotein biology, highlight recently discovered examples regulating immunity, and discuss the potential and challenges of modulating dysregulated immune responses by targeting microproteins.",1
"PurposeLung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is an aggressive subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in the development of LUSC. We aim to identify potential therapeutic targets and a TME-related prognostic signature and for LUSC.MethodsTME-related genes were obtained from TCGA-LUSC dataset. LUSC samples were clustered by the non-negative matrix clustering algorithm (NMF). The prognostic signature was constructed through univariate Cox regression, multivariate Cox regression, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out to explore the enrichment pathways.ResultsThis study constructed a prognostic signature which contained 12 genes: HHIPL2, PLK4, SLC6A4, LSM1, TSLP, P4HA1, AMH, CLDN5, NRTN, CDH2, PTGIS, and STX1A. Patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the median risk score of this signature. Compared with low-risk group patients, patients in high-risk group patients had poorer overall survival, which demonstrated this signature was an independent prognostic factor. Besides, correlation analysis and GSEA results revealed that genes of this signature were correlated with immune cells and drug response.ConclusionOur novel signature based on 12 TME-related genes might be applied as an independent prognostic indicator. Importantly, the signature could be a promising biomarker and accurately predict the prognosis of LUSC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05042-0.","In recent years, as more and more lung-cancer patients have been treated with immunotherapeutic agents, their survival has been prolonged compared to before. It is well known that BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase) is predominantly found in cells of the hematopoietic system. However, there is a distinct lack of literature on BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and its effect on the immune microenvironment. Consequently, the main goal of this investigation was to analyze how BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma affects its progression, along with its prognostic significance, through the utilization of bioinformatics online resources and publicly available databases. Data on the sequencing results and clinical records of lung adenocarcinoma patients were gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the expression level of BKT, TCGA categorized lung adenocarcinoma patients into BTK high-expression and low-expression groups. We investigated the effects of BKT on clinicopathologic, genomic, and immunologic characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma patients. We analyzed BTK mRNA expression in tumors and normal tissues using two key resources: Tumor Immuno Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER 2.0) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA 2). We analyzed the prognosis of the patients using GEPIA2 and validated the results using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, we assessed BTK protein expression by Human Protein Atlas (HPA). We sought to elucidate the clinical prognostic significance of BTK in The TCGA using the online tool GEPIA 2. Furthermore, to clarify the biologic roles and pathways linked to BTK, we conducted a genomic enrichment analysis of the information. To predict the proportion of various immune cell infiltrations in the immune microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed in the TCGA database, we performed an analysis using the TIMER online tool. Using TIMER and CIBERSORT, the correlation between genes co-expressed with BTK and the corresponding tumor-infiltrating immune cells was explored; finally, the relationship between BTK expression and immune infiltration and immune checkpoints in the TMB group and the high and low groups was analyzed by R language analysis using the TCGA database. The expression of BTK provides some hints about the prognosis of the patients. The high expression of BTK is involved in immune response regulation signaling pathways, leukocyte-mediated immunity, leukocyte intercellular adhesion, graft rejection, and complement. Analysis of the GEPIA 2 database showed that BTK was co-expressed with the genes FGD2, SASH3, NCKAP1L, CD53, ARHGAP30 and LPXN. Increased expression of the above-mentioned genes resulted in increased proportions of CD8 + T cells, memory CD4 + T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and decreased proportions of Treg cells and TH2 cells. In addition, our study revealed a strong positive correlation between various key immune checkpoints (for example, PDCD1, CD274, PDCD1LG2, CTLA4, HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and SIGLEC15) and BTK expression. In conclusion, increased BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma is closely associated with prolonged survival of lung-cancer patients. Moreover, the genes classified under the BTK high-expression group exhibit significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, suggesting a potential impact on the tumor microenvironment. We investigated the potential of BTK as a tumor suppressor gene in predicting prolonged patient survival. In addition, we further investigated the possibility that BTK further affects the immunotherapeutic response of patients by influencing the microenvironment of tumor immune infiltration, but the relevant mechanisms remain to be further studied.",1
"IntroductionOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent malignant condition. This study aimed to investigate the role of mTORC1 signaling and develop a prognostic model for OSCC.Materials and MethodsThe single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was utilized to calculate the Z-Score of Hallmarks in OSCC, followed by univariate Cox regression analysis to identify processes associated with prognosis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed using transcriptomic data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) cohort to identify genes correlated with mTORC1 signaling. A six-gene prognostic model was constructed using multifactorial Cox regression analysis and validated using an external dataset.ResultsThe study uncovered a strong linkage between mTORC1, glycolysis, hypoxia, and the prognosis of OSCC. mTORC1 signaling emerged as the most significant risk factor, negatively impacting patient survival. Additionally, a six-gene prognostic risk score model was developed which provided a quantitative measure of patients' survival probabilities. Interestingly, within the context of these findings, TP53 gene mutations were predominantly observed in the high-risk group, potentially underlining the genetic complexity of this patient subgroup. Additionally, differential immune cell infiltration and an integrated nomogram were also reported.ConclusionThis study highlights the importance of mTORC1 signaling in OSCC prognosis and presents a robust prognostic model for predicting patient outcomes.","BackgroundThe incidence of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), one of the most aggressive and lethal skin tumors, is increasing worldwide. However, for advanced SKCM, we still lack an accurate and valid way to predict its prognosis, as well as novel theories to guide the planning of treatment options for SKCM patients. Lactylation (LAC), a novel post-translational modification of histones, has been shown to promote tumor growth and inhibit the antitumor response of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a variety of ways. We hope that this study will provide new ideas for treatment options for SKCM patients, as well as research on the molecular mechanisms of SKCM pathogenesis and development.MethodsAt the level of the RNA sequencing set (TCGA, GTEx), we used differential expression analysis, LASSO regression analysis, and multifactor Cox regression analysis to screen for prognosis-related genes and calculate the corresponding LAC scores. The content of TME cells in the tumor tissue was calculated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and the TME score was calculated based on its results. Finally, the LAC–TME classifier was established and further analyzed based on the two scores, including the construction of a prognostic model, analysis of clinicopathological characteristics, and correlation analysis of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immunotherapy. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, this study analyzed the cellular composition in SKCM tissues and explored the role of LAC scores in intercellular communication. To validate the functionality of the pivotal gene CLPB in the model, cellular experiments were ultimately executed.ResultsWe screened a total of six prognosis-related genes (NDUFA10, NDUFA13, CLPB, RRM2B, HPDL, NARS2) and 7 TME cells with good prognosis. According to Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, we found that the LAClow/TMEhigh group had the highest overall survival (OS) and the LAChigh/TMElow group had the lowest OS (p value < 0.05). In further analysis of immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME), functional enrichment, tumor mutational load and immunotherapy, we found that immunotherapy was more appropriate in the LAClow/TMEhigh group. Moreover, the cellular assays exhibited substantial reductions in proliferation, migration, and invasive potentials of melanoma cells in both A375 and A2058 cell lines upon CLPB knockdown.ConclusionsThe prognostic model using the combined LAC score and TME score was able to predict the prognosis of SKCM patients more consistently, and the LAC–TME classifier was able to significantly differentiate the prognosis of SKCM patients across multiple clinicopathological features. The LAC–TME classifier has an important role in the development of immunotherapy regimens for SKCM patients.",1
"Background.In this study, we compared programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in primary tissue samples and its soluble form (sPD-L1) concentration in matched preoperative plasma samples from gastric cancer patients to understand the relationship between tissue and plasma PD-L1 expression and to determine its diagnostic and prognostic value.Methods.PD-L1 expression in tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and sPD-L1 concentration in plasma was quantified by ELISA. The levels of the CD274 gene, which encodes for PD-L1 protein, were examined as part of bulk tissue RNA-sequencing analyses. Additionally, we evaluated the association between sPD-L1 levels and various laboratory parameters, disease characteristics, and patient outcomes.Results.GC patients had significantly higher levels of sPD-L1 in their plasma (71.69 pg/mL) compared to healthy controls (35.34 pg/mL) (p<0.0001). Moreover, sPD-L1 levels were significantly correlated with tissue PD-L1 protein, CD274 mRNA expression, larger tumor size, advanced tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis. Elevated sPD-L1 levels (>103.5 ng/mL) were associated with poor overall survival (HR=2.16, 95%CI 1.15–4.08, p=0.017). Furthermore, intratumoral neutrophil and dendritic cell levels were directly correlated with plasma sPD-L1 concentration in the GC patients.Conclusions.sPD-L1 was readily measurable in GC patients, and its level was associated with GC tissue PD-L1 expression, greater immune cell infiltration, disease progression, and survival. Thus, sPD-L1 may be a useful minimally invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in GC patients.","AbstractAlthough immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness is correlated with intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression, there are no clinically available methods to improve sensitivity to ICIs by modulating PD-L1 expression. mRNA vaccines stimulate robust interferon-dependent innate immune activation leading to four-fold increases in PD-L1 expression on peripheral and intratumoral myeloid cells and enhanced sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade in preclinical models (Sayour, Grippin, and others, NanoLetters, 2018; Mendez-Gomez, and others, Cell, 2024). We hypothesized that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-COV-2 would similarly enhance PD-L1 expression in intracranial tumors. To test this hypothesis, we utilized institutional databases to identify 5,524 patients at our institution with pathology reports including the term “PD-L1” from August 2020 to November 2023. Pathological data and dates of SARS-COV-2 vaccination were compiled for each patient. Across the entire cohort (n=5,524), receipt of a SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of biopsy was associated with a 55% increase in mean tumor proportion score (TPS) (14% vs 8.9%, p=0.029). In the subset of patients with intracranial tumors (n=187), receipt of a SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of biopsy was associated with a massive increase in TPS (57% vs 7.2%, p<0.001). To evaluate the impact of this change on clinical outcomes with immunotherapy, we utilized a second institutional database to assemble a cohort of patients with Stage IV melanoma with intracranial metastasis treated with immune checkpoint blockade during the period August 2020 through November 2023. Patients who received a SARS-COV-2 vaccine within 100 days of initiation of ICI (n=10) exhibited numerically improved overall survival compared to those without SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine (n=38) (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22-1.2, p=0.06). Median overall survival was 545 days among patients without COVID mRNA vaccination and was not met among those with COVID mRNA vaccination. This data supports further investigation of the immune modulating effect of SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with intracranial tumors treated with immune checkpoint blockade.",0
"AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.",SummaryThis article describes a case of a man in his early 40s who was diagnosed with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PPC). PPCs are rare and aggressive forms of lung cancer. Chemotherapy is of limited efficacy. We present a case that has seemingly recurred shortly after adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy following an R0 resection for localised disease. Biopsy however was negative for recurrence. PPCs may bear actionable mutations and tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used when appropriate. Immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy is emerging as the mainstay for metastatic disease despite a lack of evidence from randomised clinical trials.,1
"BackgroundSinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) comprises <1% of all head and neck cancers but has one of the highest 5-year mortalities.MethodsA systematic review and analysis using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses) guidelines was conducted on SNMM survival, recurrence, and prognostic factors.Results A total of 2,379 abstracts were reviewed resulting in 90 studies describing 3347 SNMM patients. Patients were 49.65% male and 66.5 years old. Surgery plus radiation therapy, followed by surgery only, then radiation only were the most common treatments. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy were used in 418 patients and 101 respectively. The 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals are 55.97, 40.09, and 30.35%, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival and disease-specific survival are 25.56 and 38.04%. The 5-year local, regional, and distant recurrence-free survivals are 42.35, 81.64, and 44.65%. Mean survival after diagnosis was 26.99 months. Local ( n = 650), regional ( n = 226), and distant ( n = 723) failure presented after 19.36, 6.35, and 12.42 months. Sites of metastasis were lung, liver, bone, brain, skin, kidney, and adrenal glands. Distant metastases, disease in the paranasal sinuses, and higher stage were noted to have worse survival outcomes. Positive margins did not significantly impact overall survival in 11/12 studies. ConclusionOverall survival over 20 years has remained poor with 70% of patients deceased in 5 years. About half of patients will develop distant failure and will thereafter rapidly decline. These data indicate need for advances in treatment of SNMM and new efforts with targeted immunotherapy offer a promising avenue toward improving survival outcomes.","Aim: This cohort study evaluated the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and mortality as well as ICI discontinuation among older adults with NSCLC.Methods: 2007–2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database was used and survival analysis with time-varying exposure of irAEs was applied to estimate the associations.Results & conclusion: A total of 8,175 individuals were included, with 46.8% of whom developed an irAE. Cox regression models showed the occurrence of any irAEs was associated with increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.63–1.82) and treatment discontinuation (HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.78–1.97). Some variability was observed in the effect on the two outcomes depending on the type of irAE.",1
"PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) targeted therapies may be useful for several cancers. The use of non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic molecular imaging platforms could improve clinical assessment of PD-L1 tumor status during these therapies. Contrast enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging (CE-USMI) techniques may offer versatile and cost-effective ways to detect and quantify the expression levels of cellular targets in vivo. However, conventional use of microbubbles as a blood pool contrast agent for CE-USMI is limited to accessing intravascular biomarkers rather than reflecting the tumor molecular status. Using a microfluidic based reconstruction process we therefore developed ultra-stable nanobubbles (NBs) as a contrast agent for molecular imaging of vascular and extravascular cell surface markers. We then functionalized these NBs by covalently linking to nanobody (FN3hPD-L1) targeting human (h)PD-L1 to measure the expression of human PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo. We showed the specific binding of hPD-L1 targeted NBs in cell culture, and in xenografted mouse models of hPD-L1 expressing CT26 tumors. CE-USMI of hPD-L1 in the TME in vivo showed ~3-fold increase in contrast signal compared to non-targeted NBs. Overall, in vivo use of CE-USMI with hPD-L1 targeted NBs has the potential for clinical translation and imaging of human cancers during immunotherapy, and for prognostic evaluation of patient response to PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy.","BackgroundThe CD-TK double suicide gene has become an effective therapy for bladder cancer. A novel molecular-targeted ultrasound (US) method has been developed to precisely guide nanobubbles loaded with this gene to regions within bladder tumor cells and is widely used due to its efficiency in delivering drugs to the target tumor.MethodsUniform nanoscaled nanobubbles loaded with CD-TK double suicide gene were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods.ResultsIn the present study, we synthesized CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded cationic nanobubbles conjugated with anti-VEGFR2 that can bind with VEGFR2-positive cells. Fluorescence and flow cytometry evidence show that CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded nanobubbles were successfully developed. CD-TK-CNBs delivered via US-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) enhanced transfection efficiency, overexpression of CD-TK double suicide gene, and tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro.ConclusionsThese CD-TK-CNBs may become a novel treatment for bladder cancer.",1
"BackgroundGallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare malignant tumour of the bile duct. Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations in the early stage, it is basically at an advanced stage when discovered. Radical resection remains the only curative therapy for patients with GBC. The resection rate is relatively low due to tumour invasion and metastasis, and the overall prognosis is poor. For most patients with unresectable lesions, chemotherapy has been the only recommended treatment for decades. Immunotherapy combined with TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) was proven to be effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Some physicians have attempted to apply immunotherapy and TKIs combined with traditional chemotherapy in patients with advanced GBC. However, the outcomes were not clear because limited cases were reported.Case presentationWe present a case series of four elderly patients with advanced GBC who received tislelizumab and lenvatinib combined with chemotherapy. All four patients responded to this treatment approach. Tumour responses were better in Patient 1 (TMB-H, MSS), Patient 2 (low TMB, MSS), and Patient 3 (low TMB, MSI-H) than in Patient 4 (low TMB, MSS), in whom metastasis occurred during the later stage of treatment.ConclusionThe combination of tislelizumab and lenvatinib may be a promising treatment for patients with advanced GBC. The efficacy and safety need further confirmation.","Background and aimsConversion therapy downstages tumors and renders patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) eligible for radical resection. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab plus lenvatinib and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4-HAIC) as a first-line conversion therapy.MethodsClinical data from HCC patients who were treated with the triple therapy between April 2021 and April 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), conversion resection rate (CRR), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs).ResultsA total of 18 patients completed conversion therapy assessment, which ended on March 27, 2023. The patients had a median age of 55.5 (37–72) years, and 94.4% were male. According to mRECIST, tumor shrinkage was observed in all patients, with an ORR of 94.4% (17/18), a DCR of 94.4% (17/18), and a median time to response of 1.4 (0.7–3.0) months. Successful conversion was observed in 61.1% (11/18) of patients (mRECIST). The CRR and pathological complete response were 38.9% (7/18) and 57.1% (4/7), respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 17.8 months, while median overall survival was not reached. The 6- and 9-month PFS rates were 83.3% and 66.7%, respectively. The most common TRAE (16/18 patients, 88.9%) was an increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels.ConclusionTislelizumab combined with lenvatinib and FOLFOX4-HAIC achieved a high conversion rate and acceptable toxicity in patients with unresectable HCC, suggesting that this combination may represent a new conversion strategy for this population.",1
"Lung cancer treatment is evolving, and the role of senescent macrophages in tumor immune evasion has become a key focus. This study explores how senescent macrophages interact with lung cancer cells, contributing to tumor progression and immune dysfunction. As aging impairs macrophage functions, including phagocytosis and metabolic signaling, it promotes chronic inflammation and cancer development. p16INK4a-positive macrophages are common in aged mice, and their clearance slows tumor growth, suggesting these cells support tumor proliferation and immune evasion. Targeting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and reprogramming senescent macrophages offers potential therapeutic benefits, including reversing immune aging and boosting anti-tumor immunity. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires further molecular understanding and rigorous clinical trials.","PurposeThe treatment options for metastatic soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are limited. In most cases, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has not been successful so far. Macrophages dominate the immune landscape of STSs; thus, combinatorial strategies aiming at both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages may represent a particularly relevant treatment approach for metastatic or recurrent STSs.MethodsIn this cohort study, 66 patients who underwent surgery for STSs were enrolled. Tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In cell suspensions obtained from surgical resections, human T cells were activated by superparamagnetic polymer beads and cultured at a concentration of 0.3 × 106/µl in the absence or presence of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (anti-PD-1, anti-CD47, and anti-PD-1 + anti-CD47). Supernatants from cell suspensions were analyzed using multiplex Luminex cytokine bead-based immunoassays.ResultsThe most profound response to anti-CD47 therapy was observed in an undifferentiated pleiomorphic sarcoma which also displayed high expression of CD47 in the tumor microenvironment. Both anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 therapies drastically increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment of STSs, but co-administration of both agents did not further increase cytokine secretion. Furthermore, all patient samples treated with a combination of both anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 antibodies showed a dramatic reduction in cytokine secretion.ConclusionOur findings suggest that anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 therapies do not enhance each other, and the combined application of anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 agents in vitro limits rather than potentiates their efficacy.",0
"Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are an important cause of engraftment failure and may negatively impact survival outcomes of patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using an HLA-mismatched allograft. The incidence of DSA varies across studies, depending on individual factors, detection or identification methods and thresholds considered clinically relevant. Although DSA testing by multiplex bead arrays remains semiquantitative, it has been widely adopted as a standard test in most transplant centers. Additional testing to determine risk of allograft rejection may include assays with HLA antigens in natural conformation, such as flow cytometric crossmatch, and/or antibody binding assays, such as C1q testing. Patients with low level of DSA (<2,000 mean fluorescence intensity; MFI) may not require treatment, while others with very high level of DSA (>20,000 MFI) may be at very high-risk for engraftment failure despite current therapies. By contrast, in patients with moderate or high level of DSA, desensitization therapy can successfully mitigate DSA levels and improve donor cell engraftment rate, with comparable outcomes to patients without DSA. Treatment is largely empirical and multimodal, involving the removal, neutralization, and blocking of antibodies, as well as inhibition of antibody production to prevent activation of the complement cascade. Desensitization protocols are based on accumulated multicenter experience, while prospective multicenter studies remain lacking. Most patients require a full intensity protocol that includes plasma exchange, while protocols relying only on rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin may be sufficient for patients with lower DSA levels and negative C1q and/or flow cytometric crossmatch. Monitoring DSA levels before and after HSCT could guide preemptive treatment when high levels persist after stem cell infusion. This paper aims to standardize current evidence-based practice and formulate future directions to improve upon current knowledge and advance treatment for this relatively rare, but potentially serious complication in allogeneic HSCT recipients.","PurposeColon cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the intestine. Abnormal Carboxylesterases 3 (CES3) expression had been reported to be correlated to multiple tumor progression. However, the association among CES3 expression and prognostic value and immune effects in colonic adenocarcinoma (COAD) were unclear.Patients and methodsThe transcription and expression data of CES3 and corresponding clinical information was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The CES3 protein expression and the prognostic value were verified based on tissue microarray data. The Cancer immune group Atlas (TCIA), Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm and the GSE78220 immunotherapy cohort were used to forecast immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, a prognostic immune signature was constructed and verified.ResultsCompared with normal colon tissues, the expression of mRNA and protein levels of CES3 were downregulated in tumor tissues. CES3 expression was associated with TIICs. Hihg-CES3 COAD patients had better efficacy of concurrent immunotherapy. CES3-related immune genes (CRIs) were identified and were then used to construct prognostic immune signature and had been successfully verified in GES39582.ConclusionCES3 might be a potential immune-related gene and promising prognostic biomarker in COAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05156-5.",0
"Lung Cancer remains a significant health concern, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic avenues due to the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current treatments. In this study, we utilized a thorough in-silico and in-vitro methodology to develop prospective drugs for the treatment of lung cancer. The active components of Citrus latifolia were identified through the utilization of a variety of pharmacological instruments, such as Gene Ontology, GeneCards, DrugBank, the Chinese Traditional Drug Database, and GeneMANIA. Subsequent molecular docking studies using GOLD software revealed Hesperidin as the most promising candidate, exhibiting a remarkable binding affinity (GOLD score: 60.98 kcal/mol) towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a pivotal target in lung cancer therapy. Further validation through Schrodinger-Glide redocking reaffirmed the robust interaction between Hesperidin and EGFR. Pharmacokinetic profiling of top-scoring ligands indicated favorable drug-like properties, supporting their therapeutic potential. Molecular dynamics simulations employing Desmond software demonstrated the structural stability and persistence of the Hesperidin-EGFR complex over a 100-ns trajectory, corroborating its efficacy. Additionally, cytotoxicity analysis revealed a potent inhibitory effect of Hesperidin with an IC50 value of 34.25 µg/ml. Collectively, our findings underscore Hesperidin from Citrus latifolia as a promising candidate for lung cancer therapy, warranting further investigation through in-vivo studies for clinical translation.Graphical Abstract","BackgroundDespite great advances in its early diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer is still an intractable disease and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and morbidity in the world. The family of Polo-like kinases (PLKs) consists of five serine/threonine kinases, which have been reported to participate in various human diseases. However, the expression and prognostic value of each PLK in human lung cancer have not been fully understood. This study analyzed mRNA expression and prognostic value of different PLKs in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsFirst, mRNA expression of PLKs in patients with NSCLC from the Oncomine and the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database was investigated. Then, a Kaplan–Meier plotter was employed for survival analysis. The sequence alteration for PLKs was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the cBioPortal database. Additionally, we analyzed the association among different PLKs using the LinkedOmics database. Finally, the enrichment analysis of PLKs was achieved using the DAVID database.ResultsThe mRNA expression levels of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly overexpressed, while mRNA expression level of PLK3 was underexpressed in patients with NSCLC. mRNA expressions of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly and positively related to the tumor stage of NSCLC. Increased expressions of PLK1, PLK4, and PLK5 and decreased expression of PLK2 were attributed to limited overall survival time in NSCLC. PLK1 was positively correlated with PLK4 via the LinkedOmics database.ConclusionsPLKs are relevant targets for NSCLC treatment, especially PLK1 and PLK4.",1
"PurposeNeuroblastoma is a challenging pediatric tumor with a need for improved treatment strategies. This study explores the role of disulfidptosis, a form of cell death induced by intracellular disulfide accumulation, in neuroblastoma and its implications for prognosis and immune infiltration.MethodsWe subgrouped neuroblastoma samples based on disulfidptosis-related gene expression and constructed a disulfidptosis potential index (DPI) to quantify disulfidptosis levels in neurobalstoma. The correlation between DPI, outcome, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity were explored.ResultsCombing RNA-seq and single-cell dataset, we found that higher disulfidptosis potential index (DPI) is associated with poorer outcomes in neuroblastoma patients, indicating the detrimental impact of enhanced disulfide stress and cellular dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that higher DPI is correlated with reduced immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an immunosuppressive milieu in high DPI neuroblastomas. The DPI-high neuroblastoma may benefit from the estrogen pathway related drug fulvestrant.ConclusionOverall, this study highlights the significance of disulfidptosis as a potential therapeutic target and underscores the importance of integrating immune modulation strategies, offering new avenues for improved management of neuroblastoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05392-9.","PurposeThe primary objective of this study was to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks and evaluate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and key biomarkers within the ceRNA networks in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients.MethodsComprehensive bioinformatics tools were used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs (DEMs), and lncRNAs (DELs) related to COAD, leading to the creation of ceRNA networks. The CIBERSORT technique was employed to assess the significance of TIICs in COAD, and an immune-related prognosis prediction model was subsequently developed. Co-expression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between key genes in ceRNA networks and immunologically significant TIICs. The study also utilized 5 GEO datasets and web-based databases to externally validate the findings.ResultsThe study revealed a statistically significant relationship between key hub genes and immune cells, as determined through co-expression analysis. Two hub regulators (SOX12 and H19) demonstrated significant prognostic value in the ceRNA-related prognostic model, and their elevated expression levels were verified across multiple CRC cell lines. Additionally, the knockdown of SOX12 led to a suppression of proliferation, migration, and invasion in colon cancer cells.ConclusionThrough the construction of ceRNA networks and evaluation of TIICs, the study successfully established two risk score models and nomograms. These models serve as valuable tools for understanding the molecular processes and predicting the prognosis of COAD patients. Further validation of hub regulators SOX12 and H19 substantiates their potential role as key biomarkers in COAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05316-7.",1
"Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is a novel chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer. Although rashes are reported as a common adverse event from this therapy, a paucity of literature is available on dermatologic toxicities to EV, especially with respect to bullous dermatoses. This case report will review a unique bullous dermatosis in the setting of EV therapy, including the diagnostic workup and management. Because cutaneous adverse events to chemotherapy and immunotherapy are common and can often result in dose reduction and treatment withdrawal for cancer patients, awareness of these manifestations and understanding how to manage them is crucial to providing quality care to this patient population.","PurposeCancer vaccine (CV) has thrived as a promising tool for cancer prevention and treatment. However, how to maintain the integrity and diversity of individualized vaccine antigens and activate the adaptive immune system is still challenging.MethodsHerein, a preventive and therapeutic vaccine platform for in situ effective multi-model synergistic therapy is developed. In our study, we process B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen (LNF) to obtain LNF cells, the characterization of LNF cells were conducted. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect and immune activation ability were studied, and the role as a CV were investigated.ResultsThe LNF cells preserve intact cellular structure and tumor-associated self-antigen gp100. Moreover, LNF cells have the ability of loading and releasing doxorubicin (DOX). Except for the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy brought by DOX, the LNF cells can promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and induce immune response by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly with the existence of adjuvant, R848. Specifically, the CD8+ T cells of mice in LNF-DOX/R848 group are 6 times of that in PBS group in tumor microenvironment, and twice in spleen. Therefore, LNF cells can also be utilized as a CV. Vaccination with LNF/R848 cells effectively suppress the tumor growth in mice by fivefold as compared to the control group.ConclusionIn this work, we obtain the LNF cells with a simple procedure. The LNF cells not only provides a tumor cells-based multi-modal system for cancer therapy but inspires new insights into future development of individualized CVs strategies.Graphical AbstractThis study processes live B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen to obtain LNF cells, which preserve cell integrity and homologous targeting ability. The LNF cells can load and deliver drug and can serve as tumor vaccine. Results demonstrated the LNF cells have effective prophylactic ability, and ideal anti-tumor ability with the loaded drug and adjuvant.

"Despite significant advancement in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of breast carcinoma, the prognosis remains dismal. Recently, with advances in its understanding, various immune system-based management strategies have been developed. CTLA-4 suppresses lymphocyte reactivity, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2 receptor expression and triggers cell cycle arrest. PD-L1 inhibits the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibits release of cytokines. Hence, we planned to evaluate the immunoexpression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in invasive ductal carcinoma breast and seek correlation between their immunopositivity and the clinicopathological parameters. This was a retrospective study conducted on archival material of 50 cases of breast carcinoma tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological details were recorded. All cases were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Cytoplasmic expression of CTLA-4 and membranous expression of PD-L1 were considered positive and staining intensity was recorded as mild, moderate, and intense. Data was recorded and analyzed. Immunopositivity for CTLA-4 was seen in 92% of cases of breast carcinoma. CTLA-4 staining intensity showed significant association with TNM staging of breast carcinomas (p = 0.036). Age group of the breast carcinoma cases showed a statistically significant correlation with PD-L1 immunoexpression (p = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between all other clinicopathological characteristics and CTLA-4 or PD-L1 immunostaining. Our study shows that CTLA-4 is a more important immune checkpoint regulator in breast carcinomas in comparison to PD-L1. Thus, anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy might prove to be of immense help in the treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma breast showing overexpression of CTLA-4.","PurposeNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is ranked the top otorhinolaryngology malignant tumors in the world. However, the general prognosis of recurrent and metastatic (R/M) nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) remains poor, and current surgery and chemoradiotherapy do not generate satisfactory outcomes.MethodsAs a new therapeutic choice, immunotherapy, especially with regard to the development of checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors have made considerable progress in recent years. As Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with increased risk of NPC, EBV-related immunotherapy may lead to a breakthrough in advanced NPCs.ResultsIn this review, we summarized the clinical characters of NPC, and several past and ongoing clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors and EBV-CTLs (CTLs: cytotoxic T lymphocytes) in R/M NPC immunotherapy.ConclusionWe conclude that although the evaluated effects of new immunotherapy drugs have brought us hope on NPC treatment, further phase II-III trials with larger samples are still required to improve the proportion and scheme of drug collocation for better clinical outcomes and less drug-related safety.",1
"BackgroundMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a heterogeneous disease in which molecular stratification is needed to improve clinical outcomes. The identification of predictive biomarkers can have a major impact on the care of these patients, but the availability of metastatic tissue samples for research in this setting is limited.ObjectiveTo study the prevalence of immune biomarkers of potential clinical utility to immunotherapy in mCRPC and to determine their association with overall survival (OS).Design, setting, and participantsFrom 100 patients, mCRPC biopsies were assayed by whole exome sequencing, targeted next-generation sequencing, RNA sequencing, tumor mutational burden, T-cell–inflamed gene expression profile (TcellinfGEP) score (Nanostring), and immunohistochemistry for programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), SRY homology box 2 (SOX2), and the presence of neuroendocrine features.Outcome measurements and statistical analysisThe phi coefficient determined correlations between biomarkers of interest. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) from Cox regression.Results and limitationsPD-L1 and SOX2 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (combined positive score ≥1 and >5% cells, respectively) in 24 (33%) and 27 (27%) mCRPC biopsies, respectively; 23 (26%) mCRPC biopsies had high TcellinfGEP scores (>–0.318). PD-L1 protein expression and TcellinfGEP scores were positively correlated (phi 0.63 [0.45; 0.76]). PD-L1 protein expression (aHR: 1.90 [1.05; 3.45]), high TcellinfGEP score (aHR: 1.86 [1.04; 3.31]), and SOX2 expression (aHR: 2.09 [1.20; 3.64]) were associated with worse OS.ConclusionsPD-L1, TcellinfGEP score, and SOX2 are prognostic of outcome from the mCRPC setting. If validated, predictive biomarker studies incorporating survival endpoints need to take these findings into consideration.","PurposePolypharmacy is a common problem among older adults. However, its prevalence and impact on the clinical outcomes of anticancer treatment, such as survival and adverse events, in older patients with advanced cancer have not been well investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from Japanese patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 2016 and 2019.ResultsAmong 157 older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients, the prevalence of polypharmacy, defined as ≥ 5 medications, was 59.9% (94/157). The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use, according to the screening tool of older people’s prescription (STOPP) criteria version 2, was 38.2% (60/157). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 3.7 and 5.5 months, respectively (P = 0.0017). The median overall survival (OS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 9.5 and 28.1 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between polypharmacy and OS, but no significant associations between polypharmacy and PFS. Polypharmacy was not associated with immune-related adverse events but was associated with higher rate of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment (59.6% vs. 31.7%, P < 0.001).ConclusionPolypharmacy is an independent prognostic factor in older patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI. Also, polypharmacy could be utilized as a simple indicator of patients’ comorbidities and symptoms or as a predictive marker of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03252-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"BackgroundCuproptosis, a novel form of cell death mediated by protein lipoylation, is intricately linked to mitochondrial metabolism. However, the clinical association of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in thyroid cancer remains unclear. In this study, we performed a systematic investigation on the differential expression and genetic alterations of CRGs in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and constructed a CRG signature to predict the prognosis of PTC patients.MethodsWe integrated the data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and analyzed the expression of 10 CRGs in PTC. CRG signature was constructed using univariate Cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. In addition, the signature-related molecular features were validated by a combination of functional enrichment, Cox regression, and immune infiltration analysis. Independent validation cohort and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to validate the expression of differentially expressed CRG (CDKN2A).ResultsThyroid cancer patients could be divided into two subtypes (high and low CRG score groups). We found that the overall survival (OS) of patients was lower in the high CRG score group (HCSG) than in the low CRG score group (LCSG) (P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) values for 3 years, 5 years, and 8 years were 0.872, 0.941, and 0.976, respectively. Cox regression analysis indicated that the CRG score could serve as an independent prognostic indicator for PTC. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the CRG prognostic signature was also associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. In HCSG, the immune suppression cell score was significantly higher than in LCSG. In addition, we identified the expression of CRG (CDKN2A) by qRT-PCR, and the results aligned with the TCGA database.ConclusionOur CRG signature demonstrates excellent predictive capabilities for the prognosis of PTC patients. CRGs may play an important role in tumorigenesis and could be used to predict the immunotherapy efficacy of PTC.","PurposeHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a highly deadly malignant tumor with high recurrence and metastasis rates. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in tumor metastasis, recurrence, and resistance to drugs, which have attracted widespread attention in recent years. Research has shown that pseudogenes may regulate stemness to promote the progression of HCC, but its specific mechanisms and impact on prognosis remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, clinical prognosis information of HCC was first downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then we calculated the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) of HCC. We also screened the differentially expressed pseudogene (DEPs) and conducted univariate Cox regression analysis to investigate their effect on the prognosis of HCC. Further, genomic mutation frequency analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to compare the role of pseudogenes and stemness in promoting the progression of HCC. Finally, we conducted the correlation analysis to examine the potential mechanism of pseudogenes regulating stemness to promote the progression of HCC and detected the possible pathways through the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis.ResultsHerein, we revealed that the high stemness of HCC correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. We obtained 31 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated DEPs in HCC and screened CTB-63M22.1, a poor prognostic indicator of HCC. In addition, CTB-63M22.1 had a mutation frequency similar to mRNAsi and acted in a module similar to that of mRNAsi on HCC. We then screened two RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) LIN28B and NOP56 with the highest correlation with stemness. We also discovered that they were primarily enriched in the biological process as examples of mitotic nuclear division and cell cycle.ConclusionsCollectively, these results revealed that pseudogenes CTB-63M22.1 may regulate cancer stemness by regulating RBPs, suggesting that CTB-63M22.1 may serve as an innovative therapeutic target and a reliable prognostic marker for HCC.",1
"BackgroundIt is unknown how the cell cycle plays a role in breast cancer (BC). This study aimed to establish a clinically applicable predictive model to predict the therapeutic responses and overall survival in BC patients.Materials and methodsCell cycle-related genes (CCGs) were identified within the Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (n is equal to 1001) and the Gene Expression Omnibus cohort (n is equal to 3265). An analysis of univariate and multivariate Cox was then conducted to develop a nomogram based on CCGs. After validating the nomogram, risk cohort stratification was established and the predictive value was examined. Finally, immune cell infiltration and therapeutic responses were analysed.ResultsBased on 15 CCGs, 4 prognostic predictors were identified and entered into the nomogram. According to the curves of calibration, the estimated and observed value of the nomogram is in optimal agreement. Subsequently, stratification into two risk cohorts showed that the predictive value, immune cell infiltration and overall survival were better among patients with low risk. Immune checkpoint expression in patients with BC at higher risk was downregulated. Furthermore, the results of the study revealed that doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cisplatin and vinorelbine all had higher IC50 values in patients with high-risk BC.ConclusionThe nomogram based on CCG could assess tumour immune micro-environment regulation and therapeutic responses of immunotherapy in BC. Moreover, it may provide novel information on the control of immune micro-environment infiltration in BC and aid in the development of targeted immunotherapy.","Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) based liquid kidney biopsies have the potential to detect the chances of kidney transplant rejection. Several studies have found that dd-cfDNA can be used to determine the risk of kidney transplant rejection and may correlate with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A high concentration of dd-cfDNA in the body fluids may indicate possible transplant rejection since dd-cfDNA is released as a result of apoptotic and necrotic processes initiated by the recipient’s immune system. dd-cfDNA assays have advantages over conventional biopsies since they are noninvasive, and therefore, have the potential to provide a safe and reliable biomarker. Different dd-cfDNA levels have been reported above a number of cutoff thresholds: ABMR at 2.45% and TCMR at 1.3%, compared with 0.44% in healthy patients; and eGFR at 2.5%, a decrease of 25% compared with healthy patients. These results indicate the levels of dd-cfDNA that may be used to signal possible kidney rejection. dd-cfDNA assay is a rapid technique, making it particularly useful in emergencies, and further research into its use in the study of kidney rejection should prove beneficial.",0
"Background:There is a growing literature base regarding menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination among premenopausal people. However, relatively little is known about uterine bleeding in postmenopausal people following COVID-19 vaccination.Objectives:To examine trends in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses over time before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction and describe cases of new-onset postmenopausal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design:All analyses focused on members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest ages 45 and older who were diagnosed with incident postmenopausal bleeding in the electronic medical record. Members with pre-existing postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding, or who were at increased risk of bleeding due to other health conditions, were excluded. We used segmented regression analysis to estimate changes in the incidence of postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses from 2018 through 2021 in Kaiser Permanente Northwest members meeting inclusion criteria, stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status in 2021. Additionally, we identified all members with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccination between December 14, 2020, through August 14, 2021, who had an incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnosis within 60 days of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination, diagnostic procedures, and presumed bleeding etiology were assessed through chart review and described. A temporal scan statistic was run on all cases without clear bleeding etiology.Results:In a population of approximately 80,000 individuals per month there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction (p=0.59). Among 48,438 vaccinated individuals, 104 had postmenopausal bleeding first diagnosed within 60 days following COVID-19 vaccination; 76% of cases (79/104) were confirmed as post-vaccination postmenopausal bleeding after chart review. Median time from vaccination to bleeding onset was 21 days (range: 2–54 days). Among the 56 postmenopausal bleeding cases with a provider-attributed etiology, the common causes of bleeding were uterine or cervical lesions (50% [28/56]), hormone replacement therapy (13% [7/56]), and proliferative endometrium (13% [7/56]). Among the 23 cases without a clear etiology, there was no statistically significant clustering of postmenopausal bleeding onset following vaccination.Conclusions:Within this integrated health system, introduction of COVID-19 vaccines was not associated with an increase in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses. Diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding in the 60 days following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination was rare.","Background.There is evidence suggesting that COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with small, transitory effects on uterine bleeding, possibly including menstrual timing, flow, and duration, in some individuals. However, changes in health care seeking, diagnosis, and workup for abnormal uterine bleeding in the COVID-19 vaccine era are less clear.Objectives.To assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation in a large integrated health system.Study Design.Using segmented regression, we assessed whether the availability of COVID-19 vaccines was associated with changes in monthly, population-based rates of incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses compared to the pre-pandemic period in health system members ages 16–44 years who were not menopausal. We also compared clinical and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with incident abnormal uterine bleeding between December 2020 through October 13, 2021 by vaccination status (never vaccinated, vaccinated in the 60 days prior to diagnosis, vaccinated more than 60 days prior to diagnosis) and conducted detailed chart review of patients diagnosed with abnormal uterine bleeding within 1–60 days of COVID-19 vaccination in the same time period.Results.In monthly populations ranging from 79,000 to 85,000 female health system members, incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis per 100,000 person-days ranged from 8.97 to 19.19. There was no significant change in the level or trend in the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses between the pre-pandemic (January 2019-January 2020) and post-COVID-19 vaccine (December 2020-December 2021) periods. A comparison of clinical characteristics of 2,717 abnormal uterine bleeding cases by vaccination status suggested that abnormal bleeding among recently vaccinated patients was similar or less severe than abnormal bleeding among patients who had never been vaccinated patients or those vaccinated more than 60 days prior. There were also significant differences in age and race of patients with incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses by vaccination status: never vaccinated patients were the youngest and those vaccinated more than 60 days prior were the oldest; the proportion of patients who were Black/African American was highest among never vaccinated patients, and the proportion of Asian patients was higher among vaccinated patients. Chart review of 114 confirmed post-vaccination abnormal uterine bleeding cases diagnosed from December 2020 through October 13, 2021 found that the most common symptoms reported were changes in timing, duration, and volume of bleeding. Approximately one-third of cases received no diagnostic workup; 57% had no etiology for the bleeding documented in the electronic health record. In 12% of cases, the patient mentioned or asked about a possible link between their bleeding and their recent COVID-19 vaccine.Conclusions.The availability of COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with a change in incidence of medically attended abnormal uterine bleeding in our population of over 79,000 female patients of reproductive age. Additionally, among 2,717 patients with abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses in the period following COVID-19 vaccine availability, receipt of the vaccine was not associated with greater bleeding severity.",1
"Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen‐presenting cells involved in promoting and controlling immune responses. Different subsets of DC, named tolerogenic (tol)DC, play a critical role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and in fostering tolerance. These unique skills make tolDC especially attractive for strategies aimed at re‐establishing/inducing tolerance in immune‐mediated conditions. The generation of potent tolDC in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes has seen remarkable advancements. TolDC modulate T cell dynamics by favoring regulatory T cells (Tregs) and curbing effector/pathogenic T cells. Among the several methods developed for in vitro tolDC generation, IL‐10 conditioning has been proven to be the most efficient, as IL‐10‐modulated tolDC were demonstrated to promote Tregs with the strongest suppressive activities. Investigating the molecular, metabolic, and functional profiles of tolDC uncovers essential pathways that facilitate their immunoregulatory functions. This Review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of tolDC in health and disease, focusing on IL‐10 production, functional characterization of in vitro generated tolDC, molecular and metabolic changes occurring in tolDC induced by tolerogenic agents, clinical applications of tolDC‐based therapy, and finally new perspectives in the generation of effective tolDC.","Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) refers to a broad spectrum of conditions associating fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis) with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and potentially cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). The first stages of these diseases are reversible and the immune system, together with metabolic factors (obesity, insulin resistance, Western diet, etc.), can influence the disease trajectory leading to progression or regression. Dendritic cells are professional antigen‐presenting cells that constantly sense environmental stimuli and orchestrate immune responses. Herein, we discuss the existing literature on the heterogeneity of dendritic cell lineages, states, and functions, to provide a comprehensive overview of how liver dendritic cells influence the onset and evolution of MASLD.",1
"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options. Nanotechnology, particularly the use of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), offers new perspectives for targeted photothermal therapies.ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of nanomediated photothermal therapy (PTT) using GNP functionalized with folate and anti-Cadherin-1 antibodies (Cad-1) in the treatment of HCC in a validated murine model.MethodsA bionanosystem composed of gold nanoparticles conjugated with polyethyleneimine (PEI), folic acid (FA), and Cad-1 was synthesized and characterized. A HCC murine model was induced by administration of diethylnitrosamine and carbon tetrachloride. After tumor confirmation, animals were divided into four groups and treated with different doses of the nanoconstruct, followed by near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation (808 nm). A total of 16 animals were allocated into four experimental groups (n = 4 per group). Histological analysis and serum biochemical assays (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)) were performed.ResultsThe treatment induced focal coagulative necrosis within tumor regions, with minimal impact on surrounding healthy liver tissue. Significant reductions in AST and GGT levels were observed in animals treated with higher doses (p < 0.05), confirming the efficacy and selectivity of the therapy. Immunohistochemistry confirmed E-cadherin overexpression in tumor tissue, suggesting a possible diagnosic potential for the targeting system.ConclusionThe GNPs-PEI-FA-Cad-1 system demonstrated promising results for targeted photothermal therapy in HCC, with selective tumor ablation and limited hepatotoxicity. The validated murine model provides a robust platform for preclinical assessment of similar nanotherapies.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in India. This review explores the epidemiological trends and the landscape of systemic therapy for HCC in the Indian context, acknowledging the recent shift in etiology from viral hepatitis to lifestyle-associated factors.A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, including data from the Global Cancer Observatory and the Indian Council of Medical Research, along with a critical analysis of various clinical trials. The article investigates systemic therapies in-depth, discussing their mechanisms, efficacy, and adaptation to Indian healthcare framework.Progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of ≤0.6 compared to sorafenib, overall survival of ∼16–19 months, and objective response rate of 20–30% are the defining thresholds for systemic therapy clinical trials. Systemic therapy for advanced HCC in India primarily involves the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, and cabozantinib, with sorafenib being the most commonly used drug for a long time. Monoclonal antibodies such as ramucirumab and bevacizumab and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, are expanding treatment horizons. Lenvatinib has emerged as a cost-effective alternative, and the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. Despite these advances, late-stage diagnosis and limited healthcare accessibility pose significant challenges, often relegating patients to palliative care.Addressing HCC in India demands an integrative approach that not only encompasses advancements in systemic therapy but also targets early detection and comprehensive care models. Future strategies should focus on enhancing awareness, screening for high-risk populations, and overcoming infrastructural disparities. Ensuring the judicious use of systemic therapies within the constraints of the Indian healthcare economy is crucial. Ultimately, a nuanced understanding of systemic therapeutic options and their optimal utilization will be pivotal in elevating the standard of HCC care in India.",1
"The human body contains approximately 100 trillion microorganisms, predominantly within the gastrointestinal tract, collectively called the gut microbiota. Investigations have revealed the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain, characterized as the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" This axis represents an important regulator of brain development and function, immune system development, and nutrient metabolism, making it a target for efforts to alleviate the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Despite extensive biomedical and clinical research, our understanding of the causes, optimal treatment, and progression of NDDs remains limited. This paper aims to summarize the available knowledge on the role played by gut microbiota and how it is connected to the progression of neurodegenerative conditions; in particular, the relationship between the microbiota and gut-brain communications and the gut microbiota and neuro-immune conditions is reviewed. We discuss how and why the gut immune system communicates with the brain and how this communication impacts neurodegeneration. Next, we examine the alterations in the gut microbiota, immune response, and brain changes associated with gut dysbiosis. Finally, we highlight the preclinical and clinical evidence for probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, dietary supplements, natural drugs, and exercise intervention as potential therapeutic approaches that could lead to a new treatment paradigm for NDDs.","The precise prediction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complex structures is pivotal for understanding cellular immune responses and advancing vaccine design. In this study, we enhanced AlphaFold’s capabilities by fine-tuning it with a specialized dataset consisting of exclusively high-resolution class I MHC-peptide crystal structures. This tailored approach aimed to address the generalist nature of AlphaFold’s original training, which, while broad-ranging, lacked the granularity necessary for the high-precision demands of class I MHC-peptide interaction prediction. A comparative analysis was conducted against the homology-modeling-based method Pandora as well as the AlphaFold multimer model. Our results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model outperforms others in terms of root-mean-square deviation (median value for Cα atoms for peptides is 0.66 Å) and also provides enhanced predicted local distance difference test scores, offering a more reliable assessment of the predicted structures. These advances have substantial implications for computational immunology, potentially accelerating the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines by providing a more precise computational lens through which to view MHC-peptide interactions.",0
"PurposeSelinexor is a novel XPO1 inhibitor which inhibits the export of tumor suppressor proteins and oncoprotein mRNAs, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. While selinexor is currently FDA approved to treat multiple myeloma, compelling preclinical and early clinical studies reveal selinexor’s efficacy in treating hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, including sarcoma, gastric, bladder, prostate, breast, ovarian, skin, lung, and brain cancers. Current reviews of selinexor primarily highlight its use in hematologic malignancies; however, this review seeks to summarize the recent evidence of selinexor treatment in solid tumors.MethodsPertinent literature searches in PubMed and the Karyopharm Therapeutics website for selinexor and non-hematologic malignancies preclinical and clinical trials.ResultsThis review provides evidence that selinexor is a promising agent used alone or in combination with other anticancer medications in non-hematologic malignancies.ConclusionFurther clinical investigation of selinexor treatment for solid malignancies is warranted.","Although significant advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer (BC) in recent years, BC remains the most common cancer in women and one of the main causes of death among women worldwide. Currently, more than half of BC patients have no known risk factors, emphasizing the significance of identifying more tumor-related factors. Therefore, we urgently need to find new therapeutic strategies to improve prognosis. Increasing evidence demonstrates that the microbiota is present in a wider range of cancers beyond colorectal cancer. BC and breast tissues also have different types of microbiotas that play a key role in carcinogenesis and in modulating the efficacy of anticancer treatment, for instance, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. In recent years, studies have confirmed that the microbiota can be an important factor directly and/or indirectly affecting the occurrence, metastasis and treatment of BC by regulating different biological processes, such as estrogen metabolism, DNA damage, and bacterial metabolite production. Here, we review the different microbiota-focused studies associated with BC and explore the mechanisms of action of the microbiota in BC initiation and metastasis and its application in various therapeutic strategies. We found that the microbiota has vital clinical value in the diagnosis and treatment of BC and could be used as a biomarker for prognosis prediction. Therefore, modulation of the gut microbiota and its metabolites might be a potential target for prevention or therapy in BC.",0
"Heart failure and cancer remain 2 of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and the 2 disease entities are linked in a complex manner. Patients with cancer are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications related to the cancer therapies. The presence of cardiomyopathy or heart failure in a patient with new cancer diagnosis portends a high risk for adverse oncology and cardiovascular outcomes. With the rapid growth of cancer therapies, many of which interfere with cardiovascular homeostasis, heart failure practitioners need to be familiar with prevention, risk stratification, diagnosis, and management strategies in cardio-oncology.This Heart Failure Society of America statement addresses the complexities of heart failure care among patients with active cancer diagnoses and cancer survivors. Risk stratification, monitoring and management of cardiotoxicity are presented across stages A through D heart failure, with focused discussion on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and special populations, such as survivors of childhood and young-adulthood cancers. We provide an overview of the shared risk factors between cancer and heart failure, highlighting heart failure as a form of cardiotoxicity associated with many different cancer therapeutics. Finally, we discuss disparities in the care of patients with cancer and cardiac disease and present a framework for a multidisciplinary-team approach and critical collaboration among heart failure, oncology, palliative care, pharmacy, and nursing teams in the management of these complex patients.","Problem:Vaccination in pregnancy guards against infection. Maternal antibodies, however, can inhibit antibody production in neonates. We sought to determine the effects of maternal vaccination on neonatal immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.Method of Study:We hypothesized that mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNP) vaccination allows for a de novo neonatal antibody response even in the presence of vertically transmitted maternal antibodies. Female mice were vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA-LNPs. Mice were then bred, and 21-day-old pups were inoculated with the same mRNA-LNPs. Spike-specific IgG ELISAs were performed using mouse serum. A SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide library to perform peptide ELISAs characterized high affinity binding domains within the spike protein. Results were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests.Results:Compared to pups of unvaccinated dams, there were high levels of spike-specific IgG detected in the pups of vaccinated dams at 3 weeks of life (p < 0.0001). After neonatal vaccination, pups of unvaccinated dams had higher spike-specific serum IgG than pups of vaccinated dams at 12 weeks of life (p < 0.001). Antibody specificity to peptide moieties within spike RBD were similar when comparing a vaccinated dam to her pup at Week 3 of life, with different binding affinities observed in the pups by Week 15 of life.Conclusions:Pre-existing maternal antibodies may partially blunt the initial neonatal antibody response to mRNA-LNPs vaccination. This vaccine strategy, however, does not prohibit the subsequent development of a broad range of RBD antibody specificities that may be protective.",1
"BackgroundGallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare malignant tumour of the bile duct. Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations in the early stage, it is basically at an advanced stage when discovered. Radical resection remains the only curative therapy for patients with GBC. The resection rate is relatively low due to tumour invasion and metastasis, and the overall prognosis is poor. For most patients with unresectable lesions, chemotherapy has been the only recommended treatment for decades. Immunotherapy combined with TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) was proven to be effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Some physicians have attempted to apply immunotherapy and TKIs combined with traditional chemotherapy in patients with advanced GBC. However, the outcomes were not clear because limited cases were reported.Case presentationWe present a case series of four elderly patients with advanced GBC who received tislelizumab and lenvatinib combined with chemotherapy. All four patients responded to this treatment approach. Tumour responses were better in Patient 1 (TMB-H, MSS), Patient 2 (low TMB, MSS), and Patient 3 (low TMB, MSI-H) than in Patient 4 (low TMB, MSS), in whom metastasis occurred during the later stage of treatment.ConclusionThe combination of tislelizumab and lenvatinib may be a promising treatment for patients with advanced GBC. The efficacy and safety need further confirmation.","ABSTRACTBackgroundThe co-occurrence of PD-L1 positivity and EGFR mutations in advanced NSCLC often limits EGFR-TKIs effectiveness, with unclear mechanisms.MethodsWe analyzed 103 treatment-naive EGFR-mutant LUAD patients from three centers, assessing PD-L1 expression and performing NGS analysis.ResultsSMO mutations and MET amplification were significantly higher in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% group versus PD-L1 < 1% group (SMO: 8% vs. 0%, p = 0.048; MET: 18% vs. 7%, p = 0.023). The DNA Damage Response and Repair (DDR) pathogenic deficiency mutations, along with biological processes and signaling pathways related to DNA recombination, cell cycle transition and abnormal phosphorylation, were more prevalent in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% group. PIK3CA and RARA clonal alterations were more common in PD-L1 < 1% group, while TP53 clonal mutations predominated in PD-L1 ≥ 1% group. Retrospective analysis showed EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy extended median PFS by 9.8 months, potentially overcoming EGFR-TKI monotherapy resistance.ConclusionThis study elucidates the genomic characteristics of PD-L1-induced resistance to EGFR-TKIs. For patients with concurrent mutations in EGFR and PD-L1 expression, a first-line treatment strategy combining EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy may offer a more effective alternative.",0
"AbstractAdiponectin is an abundantly secreted hormone that communicates information between the adipose tissue, and the immune and cardiovascular systems. In metabolically healthy individuals, adiponectin is usually found at high levels and helps improve insulin responsiveness of peripheral tissues, glucose tolerance, and fatty acid oxidation. Beyond its metabolic functions in insulin-sensitive tissues, adiponectin plays a prominent role in attenuating the development of atherosclerotic plaques, partially through regulating macrophage-mediated responses. In this context, adiponectin binds to its receptors, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and AdipoR2 on the cell surface of macrophages to activate a downstream signaling cascade and induce specific atheroprotective functions. Notably, macrophages modulate the stability of the plaque through their ability to switch between proinflammatory responders, and anti-inflammatory proresolving mediators. Traditionally, the extremes of the macrophage polarization spectrum span from M1 proinflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Previous evidence has demonstrated that the adiponectin-AdipoR pathway influences M1-M2 macrophage polarization; adiponectin promotes a shift toward an M2-like state, whereas AdipoR1- and AdipoR2-specific contributions are more nuanced. To explore these concepts in depth, we discuss in this review the effect of adiponectin and AdipoR1/R2 on 1) metabolic and immune responses, and 2) M1-M2 macrophage polarization, including their ability to attenuate atherosclerotic plaque inflammation, and their potential as therapeutic targets for clinical applications.","AbstractAsthma exacerbation is a common clinical occurrence. The causal factors are not fully understood yet. Environmental pollution is linked to asthma exacerbation. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (MNP), an environmental pollutant, in asthma exacerbation. In this study, an airway allergy mouse model was established with ovalbumin as a specific antigen with or without the presence of MNP. The results showed that, in a mouse model, the intensity of airway allergy was significantly increased by exposure to MNP. RNAseq results showed an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated molecules and the Osm expression in airway epithelial cells of mice with airway allergy. Exposure of epithelial cells to MNP in culture induced the expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and ER stress associated molecules. The OSM receptor was expressed by macrophages. OSM could drive macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Inhibition of PERK, one of the key molecules of ER stress, or depletion of OSM receptor in macrophages, could effectively attenuate the MNP/ovalbumin protocol induced airway allergy. To sum up, by promoting ER stress, environmental pollutant MNP can cause airway epithelial cells to produce OSM. The latter induces macrophages to produce TNF-α, which can exacerbate airway allergy.",1

"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) markedly improve the clinical outcomes of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the intracranial efficacy of ICI is not well elucidated, and previous studies showed discordant outcomes of ICI between intracranial and extracranial diseases. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and the intracranial and extracranial response of patients with NSCLC and brain metastasis who were treated with ICI in the real-world setting.MethodsA total of 55 patients (median age, 63 years [range 42–80]; male, 78%) who had NSCLC with brain metastasis and treated with ICI monotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. We separately assessed the response rates of brain lesions and systemic lesions, and estimated the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).ResultsThe median OS and overall PFS were 17.0 months (95% CI 10.3–25.6) and 3.19 months (95% CI 2.24–5.03), respectively. The intracranial objective response rate and disease control rate of ICI were 36 and 54%, respectively. Among the 44 patients who showed disease progression, only 32% (n = 14) showed concordant outcomes and 9 patients (20%) showed opposing discordant outcomes. Eight patients continued ICI with local brain therapy after intracranial progression, and their median extracranial PFS and OS were 15 months (95% CI 5.0—not assessed [NA]) and 23.8 months (95% CI 14.7—NA), respectively.ConclusionsICI monotherapy had a clinically meaningful intracranial efficacy in NSCLC patients with brain metastasis. Watchful waiting and close monitoring without local radiotherapy might be feasible in NSCLC patients with asymptomatic active brain metastasis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04251-3.","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a dismal 5‐year survival of < 7%, despite the addition of immunotherapy to first‐line chemotherapy. Specific tumor biomarkers, such as delta‐like ligand 3 (DLL3) and schlafen11 (SLFN11), may enable the selection of more efficacious, novel immunomodulating targeted treatments like bispecific T‐cell engaging monoclonal antibodies (tarlatamab) and chemotherapy with PARP inhibitors. However, obtaining a tissue biopsy sample can be challenging in SCLC. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have the potential to provide molecular insights into a patient's cancer through a “simple” blood test. CTCs have been studied for their prognostic ability in SCLC; however, their value in guiding treatment decisions is yet to be elucidated. This review explores novel and promising targeted therapies in SCLC, summarizes current knowledge of CTCs in SCLC, and discusses how CTCs can be utilized for precision medicine.",0
"Evolving evidence indicates that tumor cells can transdifferentiate between distinct transcriptionally-determined cell states with changes in resultant phenotypes, a phenomenon known as cellular plasticity. These transitions are not driven by genetic mutations and typically in contrast to normal developmental processes, may proceed bidirectionally. Here, we review the role of cellular plasticity in the aggressive childhood solid tumor, neuroblastoma. We discuss the detection of two cell states, termed mesenchymal (MES) and adrenergic (ADRN), their properties and the transcriptional circuitries that control them, their relation to the normal embryogenesis of the sympathetic nervous system and their potential role in drug resistance, escape from therapy and development of relapse.","The mammalian gut microbiota plays diverse and essential roles in modulating host physiology. Key mediators determining the outcome of the microbiota-host interactions are the small molecule metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. The liver is a major organ exposed to gut microbial metabolites, and it serves as the nexus for maintaining healthy interactions between the gut microbiota and the host. At the same time, the liver is the primary target of potentially harmful gut microbial metabolites. In this review, we provide an up-to-date list of gut microbial metabolites that have been identified to either increase or decrease host susceptibility to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. The signaling pathways and molecular factors involved in the progression of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity are well-established, and we propose that the mouse model of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity serves as a model system for uncovering gut microbial metabolites with previously unknown functions. Furthermore, we envision that gut microbial metabolites identified to alter APAP-induced hepatotoxicity likely have broader implications in other liver diseases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis review provides an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in modulating the host susceptibility to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. It focuses on the roles of gut bacterial small molecule metabolites as mediators of the interaction between the gut microbiota and the liver. It also illustrates the utility of APAP-induced liver injury as a model to identify gut microbial metabolites with biological function.",0
"BackgroundThyroid carcinoma (THCA) represents a prevalent form of cancer globally, with its incidence demonstrating an upward trend in recent years. Accumulating evidence has indicated that programmed cell death (PCD) patterns exert a vital influence on tumor progression. Nevertheless, the association between PCD and the prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma remains to be elucidated. The current study endeavors to examine the link between PCD and the prognosis of thyroid cancer while concurrently developing a prognostic index based on PCD genes.Materials and methodsProgrammed cell death patterns were employed to construct the model and define clusters. Gene expression profile genomics and clinical data pertaining to 568 patients with thyroid cancer were sourced from the TCGA database. In addition, single-cell transcriptome data GSE184362 were procured from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for subsequent analysis.ResultsThe study harnessed six machine learning algorithms to create a programmed cell death signature (PCDS). Ultimately, the model developed via SVM was chosen as the optimal model, boasting the highest C-index. Moreover, the application of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) led to the identification of two molecular subtypes of THCA, each characterized by distinct vital biological processes and drug sensitivities. The investigation revealed that PCDS is linked to chemokines, interleukins, interferons, and checkpoint genes, as well as pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment, as determined through a comprehensive analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomes. Patients with THCA and elevated PCDS values are more inclined to exhibit resistance to conventional chemotherapy regimens, yet may display heightened responsiveness to targeted therapeutic agents. Finally, we established a nomogram model based on multivariable cox and logistic regression analyses to predict the overall survival of THCA patients.ConclusionThis research sheds new light on the role of programmed cell death (PCD) patterns in THCA. By conducting an in-depth analysis of various cell death patterns, a novel PCD model has been devised, capable of accurately predicting the clinical prognosis and drug sensitivity of patients with THCA.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05252-6.","BackgroundThe FXYD family of ion transport regulators have emerged as important modulators of cancer progression and metastasis. However, their expression and roles in ovarian cancer (OCa) have not been systematically investigated.MethodsThe expression of FXYD genes in OCa was analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as well as independent clinical samples. The prognostic values of FXYD genes were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis. To explore potential mechanisms, bioinformatics approaches including Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway analysis, GSEA and drug sensitivity correlation analysis were performed. OCa cell lines overexpressing FXYD1, FXYD5 or FXYD7 were also generated and their impacts on proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed.ResultsFXYD1 and FXYD6 were significantly downregulated while FXYD3, FXYD4 and FXYD5 were upregulated in OCa tissues compared to normal tissues. FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 were independent adverse prognostic factors for OCa patients. Pathway and drug correlation analysis revealed that FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 genes regulated diverse oncogenic signaling cascades and modulated the response to various chemotherapeutic agents. Overexpression of FXYD1, FXYD5 or FXYD7 enhanced OCa cell motility and invasiveness in vitro.ConclusionOur results demonstrate aberrant expression patterns, prognostic values, and oncogenic activities of FXYD genes in OCa. FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this disease. Targeting FXYD-mediated signaling represents a promising therapeutic strategy against OCa.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05445-z.",1
"PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.","PurposeExisting biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.MethodsAn animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.ResultsWe identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes (RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and metastasis.ConclusionThe model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04495-z.",1
"Head and neck cancers (HNC) are aggressive, difficult-to-treat tumors that can be caused by genetic factors but mainly by lifestyle or infection caused by the human papillomavirus. As the sixth most common malignancy, it presents a formidable therapeutic challenge with limited therapeutic modalities. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is appearing as a promising multitarget anticancer and antimetastatic agent. Numerous studies have shown that curcumin and its derivatives have the potential to affect signaling pathways (NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and EGFR) and molecular mechanisms that are crucial for the growth and migration of head and neck tumors. Furthermore, its ability to interact with the tumor microenvironment and trigger the immune system may significantly influence the organism’s immune response to the tumor. Combining curcumin with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy may improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the side effects of treatment, thereby increasing its therapeutic potential. This review is a comprehensive overview that discusses both the benefits and limitations of curcumin and its therapeutic effects in the context of tumor biology, with an emphasis on molecular mechanisms in the context of HNC. This review also includes possibilities to improve the limiting properties of curcumin both in terms of the development of new derivatives, formulations, or combinations with conventional therapies that have potential as a new type of therapy for the treatment of HNC and subsequent use in clinical practice.","AbstractIntroductionTreatment for relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis (AL) is an unmet need. The safety and efficacy of belantamab mafodotin (BLM) in multiple myeloma are known, whereas in AL data are limited.MethodsWe report a multi-center cohort of AL patients receiving BLM, and review all previous data on BLM therapy in AL.ResultsTwelve patients with a median of 3 (range 2–9) prior lines of therapy were included. The overall hematological response rate (ORR) was 75% (9/12), including 5 complete responses. Six of the 10 evaluable patients had organ responses. The median event-free survivals/overall survivals were 22.3 and 28.8 months, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities were mostly infections and keratopathy, occurring in 7/12 (58%). Hematological toxicities were rare. No grade 4/5 toxicities occurred. The review of the previous series reveals BLM provides an ORR of 60–83% with similar rates of corneal toxicity.ConclusionBLM, being an off-the-shelf therapy, with acceptable toxicity even in frail patients, may be a valuable option in AL, with a high ORR, and a signal for durable responses and high-quality organ responses.",0
"Breast cancer has a high incidence and high heterogeneity among women worldwide, but its lack of highly consistent in vitro research models has limited the translation of experimental results into clinical applications. The emergence of tumor organoids in the new era has aroused great interest among scientists. Organoids possess multi-omics characteristics highly preserved from parental tumors and offer advantages such as long-term and stable passaging and visualization in vitro. Thus, they have overcome multiple defects of two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). However, the lack of inter-organoid homogeneity, vascular-like fluid system and complex microenvironment has affected their wider applications, making it urgent to introduce new approaches for developing a more comprehensive functionality of this model. In recent years, the combination of tumor organoids with other innovative technologies has provided some relevantly important solutions and made it an optimal high-throughput and high-fidelity in vitro model. Here, we provide an overview of the development and optimization of breast cancer organoids, discuss how they have been integrated with several emerging technologies, and further summarize their applications in functional precision oncology. We believe that the intersection of new technologies has great potential in breast cancer translational research, which may finally provide new insights into organoid-guided breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment.","Lung Cancer remains a significant health concern, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic avenues due to the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current treatments. In this study, we utilized a thorough in-silico and in-vitro methodology to develop prospective drugs for the treatment of lung cancer. The active components of Citrus latifolia were identified through the utilization of a variety of pharmacological instruments, such as Gene Ontology, GeneCards, DrugBank, the Chinese Traditional Drug Database, and GeneMANIA. Subsequent molecular docking studies using GOLD software revealed Hesperidin as the most promising candidate, exhibiting a remarkable binding affinity (GOLD score: 60.98 kcal/mol) towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a pivotal target in lung cancer therapy. Further validation through Schrodinger-Glide redocking reaffirmed the robust interaction between Hesperidin and EGFR. Pharmacokinetic profiling of top-scoring ligands indicated favorable drug-like properties, supporting their therapeutic potential. Molecular dynamics simulations employing Desmond software demonstrated the structural stability and persistence of the Hesperidin-EGFR complex over a 100-ns trajectory, corroborating its efficacy. Additionally, cytotoxicity analysis revealed a potent inhibitory effect of Hesperidin with an IC50 value of 34.25 µg/ml. Collectively, our findings underscore Hesperidin from Citrus latifolia as a promising candidate for lung cancer therapy, warranting further investigation through in-vivo studies for clinical translation.Graphical Abstract",0
"AbstractBackground:Neoadjuvant therapy enhances the possibility of achieving radical resection and improves the prognosis for locally advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal extent of resection for locally advanced proximal GC after neoadjuvant therapy.Methods:In this study, 330 patients underwent resection in Peking University Cancer Hospital, with curative intent after neoadjuvant therapy for histologically confirmed proximal GC from January 2009 to December 2022.Results:In this study, 45 patients underwent proximal gastrectomy (PG), while 285 underwent total gastrectomy (TG). After propensity-score matching, 110 patients (71 TG and 39 PG) were included in the analysis. No significant differences between PG and TG regarding short-term outcomes and long-term prognosis were found. Specifically, PG demonstrated comparable overall survival to TG (P = 0.47). Subgroup analysis revealed that although not statistically significant, PG showed a potential advantage over TG in overall survival for patients with tumor-long diameters less than 4 cm (P = 0.31). However, for those with a long diameter larger than 4 cm, TG had a better survival probability (P = 0.81). No substantial differences were observed in baseline characteristics, surgical safety, postoperative recovery, and postoperative complications.Conclusion:For locally advanced proximal GC with objective response to neoadjuvant therapy (long diameter <4 cm), PG is an alternative surgical procedure.","ObjectivesThis study aimed to compare the efficacy of local excision (LE) and intersphincteric resection (ISR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieved a significant or complete pathological response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients with stage ypT0-1ycN0 low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy who underwent LE or ISR between June 2016 and June 2021. Baseline characteristics, short-term outcomes, long-term oncological outcomes, and functional outcomes, were compared between the two groups. To reduce the selection bias, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was performed.ResultsThis study included 106 patients (LE group: n = 51, ISR group: n = 55). There were significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (P < 0.05). After IPTW, there were almost no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. The LE group showed less postoperative complications and better function outcomes compared to the ISR group. The LE group had significantly lower rates of complications (13.7% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.014). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of long-term oncological outcomes.ConclusionsFor patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer achieving significant or complete pathological response after neoadjuvant therapy, both LE and ISR present comparable oncological outcomes. Yet, LE seems to show more advantages in terms of postoperative complications and functional outcomes. These findings offer important insights for surgical decision-making, emphasizing the necessity to consider both oncological and functional outcomes in selecting the optimal surgical approach.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05454-y.",1
"AbstractDespite standard-of-care therapy, pediatric brain tumors are now the leading cause of cancer-related death in children, highlighting an urgent need for the development of new treatments. Immunotherapy is actively being evaluated as a therapeutic approach to pediatric brain tumors, however, more research is needed to reveal additional antigenic targets that exist in these malignancies. In this study, our team performed a transcriptomic analysis of pediatric brain tumor RNA sequencing data within the Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) to identify intra and extracellular antigens that are highly expressed across major tumor types. Interestingly, our team observed that most tumors had high gene expression of a group of antigens that were unique to that specific tumor type. Specifically, our analysis revealed that diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) highly expressed the extracellular antigens CA9, CTCFL, and ST8SIA1, whereas atypical rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) highly expressed MUC1 and TEK. Other tumors that displayed high gene expression for a variety of antigenic targets included H3-wildtype high-grade gliomas (HGGs), and ependymomas (EPNs). Strikingly, we observed minimal difference in antigen expression in primary tumors when compared to patient-matched recurrences. Beyond antigen expression, we evaluated the expression of antigen processing machinery (APM) which includes major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Our findings revealed that DMGs had the lowest level of APM expression, however, these tumors uniquely expressed high levels of the immune checkpoints ADORA2A, CD276, and KLRC1. Contrarily, ATRTs showed a high expression of immune checkpoints CD274 (PD-L1), PVR, and CD80. Other tumors included in our analysis had unique expression patterns of antigen, as well as APM and immune checkpoints. Our findings illustrate that pediatric brain tumors have distinct expression patterns of antigens, APM, and immune checkpoints that are specific to tumor type, emphasizing diverse, rather than general, immunotherapeutic approaches must be considered for childhood brain tumors.","PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of main tumor resection on long-term survival compared with pleural biopsy alone in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were intraoperatively diagnosed with pleural metastasis.Materials and MethodsA total of 176 patients with adenocarcinoma who had unexpected pleural metastasis detected during surgery from 2002 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Each surgeon decided whether to perform main tumor resection or pleural biopsy alone.ResultsThe patients were grouped based on the surgical approaches: main tumor resection (resection group; n=83) and pleural biopsy only (O&C group; n=93). The resection group had better overall survival (OS; 10-year survival, 27.9% vs. 9.4%; median survival, 68.3 vs. 36.6 months; p < 0.01) and locoregional progression-free survival (10-year survival, 12.5% vs. 7.1%; median survival, 19.6 vs. 10.6 months; p < 0.01) than the O&C group. Similar results were found for OS in patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line therapy (10-year survival, 49.2% vs. 15.0%; median survival, 72.2 vs. 45.4 months; p=0.03), patients who did not undergo TKIs treatment (10-year survival, 29.4% vs. 9.2%; median survival, 82.4 vs. 23.8 months; p < 0.01), and patients with positive target gene mutation (10-year survival, 31.7% vs. 10.1%; median survival, 72.2 vs. 33.7 months; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, pleural biopsy only (hazard ratio, 1.73; p=0.04) was a significant predictor of OS.ConclusionMain tumor resection can improve survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who had unexpected pleural metastasis during operation.",0
"Currently, cancer immunotherapy efficacy is measured by endpoints, such as progression-free survival and overall survival, that are unable to reflect authentic responses to checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials. Second progression-free survival, however, could be an ideal surrogate endpoint due to its easy measurability, correlation with overall survival, and ability to evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapies. This commentary summarizes second progression-free survival data from clinical trials investigating first-line anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors. We speculate that first-line immunotherapies exert a positive influence on the efficacy of later therapies in patients with a few cancer types, though additional research is urgently warranted.","AbstractBACKGROUNDGlioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults with a poor survival and an unmet need for more effective therapies. Macroscopically, as observed through MR imaging and microscopy, these tumors are characterized by distinct tumor regions: a contrast-enhancing tumor core with a high cancer cell density and an infiltration zone that appears T2/FLAIR hyperintense without the uptake of contrast agent and consists of infiltrating tumor cells as well as non-malignant cells of the microenvironment. Previous genomic and transcriptomic studies revealed molecular differences between the tumor core and the infiltration zone. However, functional differences, such as drug sensitivity, between tumor regions are still largely unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODSTo address this gap, we collected region-specific glioblastoma patient tissue samples from both the contrast-enhancing tumor core and the non-contrast-enhanced but 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescent infiltration zone directly from surgery. We utilized pharmacoscopy, a microscopy-based single-cell drug screening approach, to identify drug responses across regions and patients. RESULTSBy profiling a library of 60 drugs across regions in a cohort of 23 patients, we identified region-specific drug responses and developed a complementarity score to pinpoint drug combinations capable of targeting both the tumor core and the infiltration zone. These combination treatments exhibited highly promising anti-tumor activity across regions and patients. CONCLUSIONGiven the high levels of functional spatial intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, relying on a single drug across patients may not be feasible for effective patient treatment. Thus, there is a strong rationale to administer drug combinations that not only consider regional heterogeneity but also account for patient-specific variations.",0
"Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer (BC) depends on the recognition of bacteria by extracellular toll-like receptors (TLRs) or the detection of mycobacterial DNA by endosomal TLRs or the cGAS-STING pathway. Agonists related to these innate immune pathways have been developed as adjuvants to potentiate the effects of immunotherapy. As innate immune pathways are important for the action of BCG and other agonists proposed for BC therapy, we decided to investigate the presence of mutations in the main receptors of these pathways. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was screened to identify BC-related mutations (apart from oncogenes), targeting, in particular, TLRs, the adaptor molecule MyD88, and the cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes) immune pathway. Among 1,724 BC entries, 103 mutations were identified in 80 affected cases in the cohort. TLR9 and TLR10 ranked among the most frequent mutated genes observed in the affected cases in our search (13 mutations each). Through all analyzed data, the search for MYD88 gene recovered only 1 mutation input in the database. Mutations in the STING and cGAS genes were found in one and four cases, respectively. We also evaluated clinical data, including the pathologic stage of BC, and gene expression from 103 mutations entries. This article attempts to highlight the relevance of mutations in genes coding for innate immune molecules in BC samples as potential biomarkers to predict individual disease outcome, and specifically to help find the appropriate treatment for each person in the future.","The integration of nanotechnology and synthetic biology could lay the framework for new classes of engineered biosensors that produce amplified readouts of disease states. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of this vision, here we present an engineered gene circuit that, in response to cancer-associated transcriptional deregulation, expresses heterologous enzyme biomarkers whose activity can be measured by nanoparticle sensors that generate amplified detection readouts. Specifically, we designed a AND-gate gene circuit that integrates the activity of two ovarian cancer-specific synthetic promoters to drive the expression of a heterologous protein output, secreted Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease, exclusively from within tumor cells. Nanoparticle probes were engineered to carry a TEV-specific peptide substrate in order to measure the activity of the circuit-generated enzyme to yield amplified detection signals measurable in the urine or blood. We applied our integrated sense-and-respond system in a mouse model of disseminated ovarian cancer, where we demonstrated measurement of circuit-specific TEV protease activity both in vivo using exogenously administered nanoparticle sensors and ex vivo using quenched fluorescent probes. We envision that this work will lay the foundation for how synthetic biology and nanotechnology can be meaningfully integrated to achieve next-generation engineered biosensors.",1
"BackgroundMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a major occupational and environmental neoplasm. The purpose of this study was to validate the clinical and epidemiological factors, diagnosis, and initial treatment among MPM patients in the Hokushin region.MethodsWe surveyed retrospective data from 152,921 cancer patients in 22 principal hospitals.ResultsA total of 166 MPM cases were newly diagnosed. These patients consisted of 136 men and 30 women, with a median age of 69 years. We estimated the incidence rate for MPM to be 0.55 cases per 100,000 person-years in this study. The ratio per 100,000 population-years was 0.39 in Fukui, 0.60 in Ishikawa, 1.02 in Toyama and 0.35 in Nagano. Forty-five patients were discovered when diagnosed incidentally in patients under observations for other diseases. Forty-six cases were diagnosed as localized disease, while 13 had accompanying regional lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, 44 cases showed infiltration into adjacent organs. A histo-cytological diagnosis was made in 164 cases (98.8%). A surgical approach, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were performed for 33, 88, and 6 patients, respectively, while 44 patients (26.5%) received best supportive care. Multimodality therapy was conducted in just 3.0% of the MPM patientsConclusionMPM has a tragically rapid progression if discovered under observations for other diseases. Workers in health-related fields should be on high alert for aggressive MPM. Better evaluation and multi-disciplinary approaches to MPM in these regions are needed to optimize multimodality therapy.","IntroductionMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, treatment-resistant tumor. Anoikis is a particular type of programmed apoptosis brought on by the separation of cell–cell or extracellular matrix (ECM). Anoikis has been recognized as a crucial element in the development of tumors. However, few studies have comprehensively examined the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in malignant mesothelioma.MethodsARGs were gathered from the GeneCard database and the Harmonizome portals. We obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the GEO database. Univariate Cox regression analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were utilized to select ARGs associated with the prognosis of MPM. We then developed a risk model, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves were employed to confirm the ability of the model. The patients were divided into various subgroups using consensus clustering analysis. Based on the median risk score, patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups. Functional analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were conducted to estimate molecular mechanisms and the immune infiltration landscape of patients. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis and tumor microenvironment landscape were further explored.ResultsA novel risk model was constructed based on the six ARGs. The patients were successfully divided into two subgroups by consensus clustering analysis, with a striking difference in the prognosis and landscape of immune infiltration. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that the OS rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than the high-risk group. Functional analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis showed that high- and low-risk groups had different immune statuses and drug sensitivity.ConclusionsIn summary, we developed a novel risk model to predict MPM prognosis based on six selected ARGs, which could broaden comprehension of personalized and precise therapy approaches for MPM.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown significant efficacy in hematological diseases. However, CAR T therapy has demonstrated limited efficacy in solid tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). One of the most important reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune cells used to eliminate tumor cells. The human transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) plays a crucial role in forming the suppressive GBM TME and driving the suppression of the anti-GBM response. To mitigate TGF-β-mediated suppressive activity, we combined a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor II (dnTGFβRII) with our previous bicistronic CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 construct, currently being evaluated in a clinical trial, to generate CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII, a tri-modular construct we are developing for clinical application. We hypothesized that this approach would more effectively subvert resistance mechanisms observed with GBM. Our data suggest that CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII significantly augments T cell proliferation, enhances functional responses, and improves the fitness of bystander cells, particularly by decreasing the TGF-β concentration in a TGF-β-rich TME. In addition, in vivo studies validate the safety and efficacy of the dnTGFβRII cooperating with CARs in targeting and eradicating GBM in an NSG mouse model.","PurposeImmunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors against anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), has not been successful in treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), dendritic cells (DCs), and the TGF-β cytokine are critical in anti-cancer immunity. We hypothesized that TGF-β enhances the immunosuppressive effects of TAM, MDSC, and DC presence in tumors.MethodsUsing a murine PDAC cell line derived from a genetically engineered mouse model, we orthotopically implanted treated cells plus drug embedded in Matrigel into immunocompetent mice. Treatments included saline control, TGF-β1, or a TGF-β receptor 1 small molecule inhibitor, galunisertib. We investigated TAM, MDSC, DC, and TAM PD-L1 expression with flow cytometry in tumors. Separately, we used the TIMER2.0 database to analyze TAM and PD-L1 gene expression in human PDAC tumors in TCGA database.ResultsTGF-β did not alter MDSC or DC frequencies in the primary tumors. However, in PDAC metastases to the liver, TGF-β decreased the proportion of MDSCs (P=0.022) and DCs (P=0.005). TGF-β significantly increased the percent of high PD-L1 expressing TAMs (32 ± 6 % vs. 12 ± 5%, P=0.013) but not the proportion of TAMs in primary and metastatic tumors. TAM PD-L1 gene expression in TCGA PDAC database was significantly correlated with tgb1 and tgfbr1 gene expression (P<0.01).ConclusionsTGF-β is important in PDAC anti-tumor immunity, demonstrating context-dependent impact on immune cells. TGF-β has an overall immunosuppressive effect mediated by TAM PD-L1 expression and decreased presence of DCs. Future investigations will focus on enhancing anti-cancer immune effects of TGF-β receptor inhibition.",1
"PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.","BackgroundLow-grade glioma (LGG) is a crucial pathological type of glioma. The present study aimed to explore multiple RNA methylation regulator-related AS events and investigate their prognostic values in LGG.MethodsThe prognostic model for low-grade glioma was established using the LASSO regression analysis. To validate prognostic value, we performed Kaplan–Maier survival analysis, ROC curves and nomograms. The ESTIMATE algorithm, the CIBERSORT algorithm and the ssGSEA algorithm were utilized to explore the role of the immune microenvironment in LGG. Subsequently, we then used GO, KEGG and GSEA enrichment analysis to explore the functional roles of these genes. In addition, we employed the GDSC database to screen potential chemotherapeutic agents.ResultsEight RNA methylation related AS events were involved in construct a survival and prognosis model, which had good ability of independent prediction for patients with LGG. Patients in the high-risk group had shorter life expectancy and higher mortality, while patients in the low-risk group had a better prognosis. We constructed a nomogram which showed an excellent predictive performance for individual OS. The risk score exhibited a close correlation with some immune cells and expression of immune checkpoints. Patients in high-risk group were characterized by immunosuppressive microenvironment and poor response to immunotherapy, and were sensitive to more chemotherapeutic drugs. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses further confirmed that significant differences existed in immune landscape between the two subgroups.ConclusionThe prognostic RNA methylation-related alternative splicing signature constructed could constitute a promising prognostic biomarker, which could serve to optimize treatment regimens.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04431-1.",1
"Bacteria encode an arsenal of diverse systems that defend against phage infection. A common theme uniting many prevalent anti-phage defense systems is the use of specialized nucleotide signals that function as second messengers to activate downstream effector proteins and inhibit viral propagation. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms controlling nucleotide immune signaling in four major families of anti-phage defense systems: CBASS, Pycsar, Thoeris, and type III CRISPR immunity. Analysis of the individual steps connecting phage detection, nucleotide signal synthesis, and downstream effector function reveals shared core principles of signaling and uncovers system-specific strategies used to augment immune defense. We compare recently discovered mechanisms used by phages to evade nucleotide immune signaling and highlight convergent strategies that shape host-virus interactions. Finally, we explain how the evolutionary connection between bacterial anti-phage defense and eukaryotic antiviral immunity defines fundamental rules that govern nucleotide-based immunity across all kingdoms of life.","Introduction:In 2018, durvalumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as consolidation immunotherapy for patients with stage III NSCLC after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, whether durvalumab benefits patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC remains unknown.Methods:We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC who completed concurrent CRT. Kaplan-Meier analyses evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who completed CRT with or without durvalumab.Results:Among 37 patients, 13 initiated durvalumab a median of 20 days after CRT completion. Two patients completed 12 months of treatment, with five patients discontinuing durvalumab owing to progression and five owing to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Of 24 patients who completed CRT without durvalumab, 16 completed CRT alone and eight completed CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Median PFS was 10.3 months in patients who received CRT and durvalumab versus 6.9 months with CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.993). CRT and EGFR TKI was associated with a significantly longer median PFS (26.1 mo) compared with CRT and durvalumab or CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.023). Six patients treated with durvalumab initiated EGFR TKIs after recurrence, with one developing grade 4 pneumonitis on osimertinib.Conclusions:In this study, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC did not benefit with consolidation durvalumab and experienced a high frequency of irAEs. Patients who initiate osimertinib after durvalumab may be susceptible to incident irAEs. Consolidation durvalumab should be approached with caution in this setting and concurrent CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR TKIs further investigated as definitive treatment.",0
"AbstractCentral to immune recognition is the glycocalyx, a glycan-rich coat on all cells that plays a crucial role in interactions that enable pathogen detection and activation of immune defenses. Pathogens and cancerous cells often display distinct glycans on their surfaces, making these saccharide antigens prime targets for vaccine development. However, carbohydrates alone generally serve as poor immunogens due to their often weak binding affinities, inability to effectively recruit T cell help, and reliance on adjuvants to iboost immune activation. The introduction of glycoconjugate vaccines, initially involving the covalent coupling of carbohydrate antigens to carrier proteins, marked a pivotal advancement by facilitating neutralizing antibody production against carbohydrate targets. Despite successes in generating glycoconjugate vaccines against certain bacterial diseases, challenges persist in creating effective vaccines against numerous intracellular pathogens and non-communicable diseases such as cancer. In this review, we highlight new developments in conjugate vaccine platforms aim to overcome these limitations by optimizing the display of glycan and T cell epitopes as well as incorporating defined carbohydrate adjuvants to direct tailored immune responses. These advancements promise to improve the effectiveness of carbohydrate-based vaccines and broaden their coverage against a wide range of diseases.",Graphical abstractThe graph was created with biorender.com (agreement number: BJ27LQOB7N).,0
"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. The progression of numerous malignancies has been linked to abnormal vesicle-mediated transport-related gene (VMTRG) expression. The prognostic importance of VMTRGs in HCC is uncertain nonetheless.MethodsUtilizing HCC data from TCGA and ICGC, we employed univariate cox analysis, unsupervised clustering, and lasso analysis to construct molecular subtypes and prognostic signature of HCC based on the prognostic-associated VMTRGs expression levels. Subsequently, we validated the expression levels of the signature genes. We investigated the probable pathways using gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Six methods were utilized to compare immune cell infiltration between two risk groups. Moreover, the “pRRophetic” algorithm was utilized to test the drug sensitivity of both groups.ResultsWe identified two distinct subtypes with divergent biological behaviors and immune functionality through unsupervised clustering. Subtype C1 demonstrated a poorer prognosis. A prognostic signature incorporating two VMTRGs (KIF2C and RAC1) was formulated. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analyses unveiled a significant upregulation of these pivotal genes within HCC tissues. The prognosis was worse for the high-risk group, which also had a higher clinicopathological grade, higher levels of tumor mutation burden (TMB), a higher immunological infiltration of CD8 + T cells, a higher expression of immune checkpoints, and enhanced immunotherapy efficacy. These two risk groups also have varied chemotherapy drug sensitivities.ConclusionsBased on VMTRGs, we have developed a signature that assists in accurate prognosis prediction and formulating personalized treatment strategies for HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05079-1.","AbstractBackgroundGlioma, characterized by limited lymphocytic infiltration, constitutes an “immune-desert” tumor displaying insensitivity to various immunotherapies. This study aims to explore therapeutic strategies for inducing tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation within the glioma microenvironment (GME) to transition it from an immune resistant to an activated state.MethodsTLS formation in GME was successfully induced by intracranial administration of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (OK-432, TLR2/4/9 agonist) and glioma antigens (i.c. αTLR-mix). We employed staining analysis, antibody neutralization, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), and BCR/TCR sequencing to investigate the underlying mechanisms of TLS formation and its role in anti-glioma immunity. Additionally, a preliminary translational clinical study was conducted.ResultsTLS formation correlated with increased lymphocyte infiltration in GME and led to improved prognosis in glioma-bearing mice. In the study of TLS induction mechanisms, certain macrophages/microglia and Th17 displayed markers of “LTo” and “LTi” cells, respectively, interaction through LTα/β-LTβR promoted TLS induction. Post-TLS formation, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells but not CD19 + B cells contributed to anti-glioma immunity. Comparative analysis of B/T cells between brain and lymph node showed that brain B/T cells unveiled the switch from naïve to mature, some B cells highlighted an enrichment of class switch recombination (CSR)-associated genes, V gene usage, and clonotype bias were observed. In related clinical studies, i.c. αTLR-mix treatment exhibited tolerability, and chemokines/cytokines assay provided preliminary evidence supporting TLS formation in GME.ConclusionsTLS induction in GME enhanced anti-glioma immunity, improved the immune microenvironment, and controlled glioma growth, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for treating glioma in the future.",0
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent form of gastrointestinal malignancy with challenges in chemotherapy resistance and side effects. Effective and low toxic drugs for CRC treatment are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death, which has garnered attention for its therapeutic potential against cancer. Baicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is the primary flavone extracted from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis that exhibits anticancer effects against several malignancies including CRC. In this study, we investigated whether baicalein induced ferroptosis in CRC cells. We showed that baicalein (1–64 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of human CRC lines HCT116 and DLD1. Co-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (1 μM) significantly mitigated baicalein-induced CRC cell death, whereas autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (25 μM), necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (10 μM), or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (10 μM) did not rescue baicalein-induced CRC cell death. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the inhibitory effect of baicalein on CRC cells is associated with ferroptosis induction. We revealed that baicalein (7.5–30 μM) dose-dependently decreased the expression levels of GPX4, key regulator of ferroptosis, in HCT116 and DLD1 cells by blocking janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway via direct interaction with JAK2, ultimately leading to ferroptosis in CRC cells. In a CRC xenograft mouse model, administration of baicalein (10, 20 mg/kg, i.g., every two days for two weeks) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth with significant ferroptosis induced by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 axis in tumor tissue. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis contributes to baicalein-induced anti-CRC activity through blockade of the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 signaling pathway, which provides evidence for the therapeutic application of baicalein against CRC.","Aim: This study investigated the role of lncRNA LINC01232 in ferroptosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials & methods: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blot experiments were performed to examine relevant mRNAs and proteins expression. The kit assays evaluated malondialdehyde, iron, Fe2+ and glutathione levels. ROS levels were verified by flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation analysis monitored the correlation among LINC01232, H3K27ac, p300 and ARNTL2.Results: LINC01232 or ARNTL2 knockdown facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis. The interaction between LINC01232 and p300 resulted in the enhancement of H3K27ac levels at ARNTL2 promoter to promote ARNTL2 transcriptional activity. ARNTL2 overexpression reversed the promoting effect of LINC01232 knockdown on ferroptosis.Conclusion: LINC01232 inhibited the ferroptosis in CRC by epigenetically upregulating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL2.",1
"Efferocytosis, the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses and effectively prevents secondary necrosis. However, the mechanisms underlying efferocytosis in acute pancreatitis (AP) remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of efferocytosis in injured human and mouse pancreatic tissues. We also observed significant upregulation of CD47, an efferocytosis-related the ""do not eat me"" molecule in injured acinar cells. Subsequently, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, anti-adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene modification, and anti-CD47 antibody to investigate the potential therapeutic role of AP. CD47 expression was negatively regulated by upstream miR133a, which is controlled by the transcription factor TRIM28. To further investigate the regulation of efferocytosis and reduction of pancreatic necrosis in AP, we used miR-133a-agomir and pancreas-specific AAV-shTRIM28 to modulate CD47 expression. Our findings confirmed that CD47-mediated efferocytosis is critical for preventing pancreatic necrosis and suggest that targeting the TRIM28-miR133a-CD47 axis is clinically relevant for the treatment of AP.","Immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) can induce life-threatening immune-related adverse events, including myocarditis and myositis, which are rare but often concurrent. The molecular pathways and immune subsets underlying these toxicities remain poorly understood. To address this need, we obtained heart and skeletal muscle biopsies for single-cell RNA sequencing in living patients with cancers treated with ICTs admitted to the hospital with myocarditis and/or myositis (overlapping myocarditis plus myositis, n=10; myocarditis-only, n=1) compared to ICT-exposed patients ruled out for toxicity utilized as controls (n=9) within 96 hours of clinical presentation. Analyses of 58,523 cells revealed CD8+ T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype expressing activation/exhaustion markers in both myocarditis and myositis. Furthermore, the analyses identified a population of myeloid cells expressing tissue-resident signatures and FcγRIIIa (CD16a), which is known to bind IgG and regulate complement activation. Immunohistochemistry of affected cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues revealed protein expression of pan-IgG and complement product C4d that were associated with the presence of high-titer serum autoantibodies against muscle antigens in a subset of patients. We further identified a population of inflammatory IL-1B+TNF+ myeloid cells specifically enriched in myocarditis and associated with greater toxicity severity and poorer clinical outcomes. These results are the first to recognize these myeloid subsets in human immune-related myocarditis and myositis tissues and nominate new targets for investigation into rational treatments to overcome these high-mortality toxicities.",1
"ObjectivesThis study aimed to compare the efficacy of local excision (LE) and intersphincteric resection (ISR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieved a significant or complete pathological response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients with stage ypT0-1ycN0 low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy who underwent LE or ISR between June 2016 and June 2021. Baseline characteristics, short-term outcomes, long-term oncological outcomes, and functional outcomes, were compared between the two groups. To reduce the selection bias, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was performed.ResultsThis study included 106 patients (LE group: n = 51, ISR group: n = 55). There were significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (P < 0.05). After IPTW, there were almost no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. The LE group showed less postoperative complications and better function outcomes compared to the ISR group. The LE group had significantly lower rates of complications (13.7% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.014). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of long-term oncological outcomes.ConclusionsFor patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer achieving significant or complete pathological response after neoadjuvant therapy, both LE and ISR present comparable oncological outcomes. Yet, LE seems to show more advantages in terms of postoperative complications and functional outcomes. These findings offer important insights for surgical decision-making, emphasizing the necessity to consider both oncological and functional outcomes in selecting the optimal surgical approach.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05454-y.","Immunotherapy has revolutionized the systemic treatment of solid tumors, including advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC), providing durable responses with a favorable safety profile. Multiple immune checkpoint inhibitor agents have been approved in monotherapy in second-line setting, and for a selected group of chemo-naïve cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression. Despite the incorporation of immunotherapy to the systemic treatment landscape of aUC, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in frontline setting for vast majority of patients. Urothelial carcinoma is a chemosensitive disease with response rates of up to 50% to frontline chemotherapy. However, the response to chemotherapy is short lasting with vast majority of patients experiencing disease progression and death within months. In this context, maintenance therapy constitutes an attractive therapeutic strategy to maximize the time to treatment failure. Different cytotoxic and targeted agents have been investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC but have not shown an impact on survival. Avelumab has become the first and only drug to improve overall survival as maintenance therapy after frontline platinum-based therapy in aUC patients and the first drug to be approved in this setting. This article will review the rational for maintenance therapy, the different drugs investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC, and the impact of avelumab maintenance therapy as a new standard of care in the management of aUC.",0
"Although autophagy sequesters intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in in vitro cultured macrophages, loss of autophagy in macrophages in vivo does not result in susceptibility to a standard low-dose Mtb infection until late during infection, leaving open questions regarding the protective role of autophagy during Mtb infection. We report herein that loss of autophagy in lung macrophages and dendritic cells results in acute susceptibility of mice to high-dose Mtb infection, a model better mimicking active tuberculosis. However, rather than observing a role for autophagy in controlling Mtb replication in macrophages, we find that autophagy suppresses macrophage responses to Mtb infection that otherwise result in the accumulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells and subsequent defects in T cell responses. Our finding that the pathogen-plus-susceptibility gene interaction is dependent on dose has important implications on understanding how Mtb infections in humans lead to a spectrum of outcomes and the potential use of autophagy modulators in clinical medicine.","The utilization of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, specifically anti-PD-1/L1 agents, prior to radical cystectomy is an emerging paradigm in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

"AbstractBackgroundSarcomatoid carcinomas (SC) are rare tumors with both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, linked to aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Sarcomatoid carcinoma of unknown primary (SCUP) is an exceedingly rare subset with limited literature and no standardized management guidelines. This study aims to characterize the clinical presentations, treatment patterns, and genomic landscape of SCUP.Patients and MethodsData were retrospectively collected from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cancer of Unknown Primary Registry. Patients included had biopsy-proven SC with no identifiable primary tumor despite comprehensive diagnostic evaluations. Baseline characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) results, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Kaplan–Meier survival estimates, and Cox proportional hazards regression.ResultsFifty-two SCUP patients were identified, with a median age of 60 years. Most patients presented with widely metastatic disease, particularly lytic bone lesions. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was noted in nearly half of the patients. IHC showed high positivity for AE1/AE3 and OSCAR antibodies. Tumor NGS revealed 247 alterations, with TP53 being the most common mutation. Patients receiving definitive therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 72 months, significantly longer than those receiving systemic therapy (14 months). Immunotherapy was a significant prognostic factor, reducing the risk of death by 90%.ConclusionsThis study provides essential insights into the clinical and genomic characteristics of SCUP, advocating for the integration of definitive therapy and immunotherapy in treatment protocols. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and improve patient outcomes.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is one of the first-line clinical therapeutic strategies for HCC. Still, the effectiveness of chemotherapy is hampered by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and drug resistance caused by insufficient delivery. Herein, we developed a metal-drug self-delivery nanomedicine (FDAH) to improve the chemo/chemodynamic therapeutic efficacy of HCC. The core of FDAH is an iron-based nanoparticle chelated with two clinical drugs, Doxorubicin (DOX) and Plerixafor (AMD3100). Additionally, the nanomedicine is externally modified with a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell, which can prolong the circulation time of the nanoparticles in the bloodstream after intravenous administration. After entering the bloodstream, the nanomedicine reaches the tumor tissue through the EPR effect and is phagocytosed by the tumor cells via HA/CD44-specific interaction. Iron ion-mediated chemodynamic therapy is mediated by the Fenton reaction to generate ROS, causing an imbalance of redox homeostasis within the tumor cells and enhancing the sensitivity of tumor cells to DOX. In addition, AMD3100 intervenes in the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to influence the infiltration level of immune cells and promote DOX chemotherapy in tumor cells. This work suggests that alleviating immunosuppression via a metal-drug self-delivery system of the CXCR4 inhibitor can effectively improve the DOX chemotherapy and iron ions-mediated chemodynamic therapy.",0
"IntroductionMetastasis remains the major cause of death in breast cancer (BrCa) and lacks specific treatment strategies. The kynurenine pathway (KP) has been suggested as a key mechanism facilitating progression of BrCa. While KP activity has been explored in primary BrCa, its role in metastasis remains unclear. To better understand this, we examined changes in the KP of BrCa with no metastasis compared to BCa that produced local or distant metastases. Given that the cancer cell secretome plays a role in metastasis, we also investigated the relationship between changes in KP activity and serum proteins of patients with local or distant metastases.MethodsTo investigate changes in the KP in BrCa, with and without metastasis, we quantified KP metabolites in blood sera collected from patients with stage 1 BrCa (n = 34), BrCa with local metastases (n = 46), BrCa with distant metastases (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 39). The serum protein profile of the BrCa patients with local or distant metastasis was determined before correlation analyses were carried out to examine the relationship between changes in the KP and cancer serum proteins using SPSS.ResultsWe found that the KP was elevated in BrCa patients with local and distant metastasis compared to healthy controls and stage 1 BrCa patients. The activity of kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) and kynureninase (KYNU) A was positively associated with disease stage and was higher compared to healthy controls. Proteome analysis in patients with local or distant metastasis revealed the dysregulation of 14 proteins, 9 of which were up-regulated and 5 down-regulated at the distant metastasis stage. Importantly, three of these proteins have not been previously linked to BrCa metastasis. In the correlation studies between the KP profile, cancer serum proteins and metastasis status, KYNU A had the greatest number of significant associations with cancer serum protein, followed by KMO.ConclusionOur findings reveal that the KP was regulated differently at various stages of BrCa and was more dysregulated in patients with local or distant metastasis. These KP activity changes showed a significant association with cancer serum proteins in BrCa patients with local or distant metastasis, highlighting the potential role of KP in BrCa metastasis.","Background and aimDanggui Buxue Decoction (DBD) has been applied to alleviate chronic heart failure (CHF) in clinics, however, its mechanism is still unclear. This study investigates the potential action mechanism of DBD for rats with CHF combined with liver injury.Experimental procedureFor this purpose, this study established a CHF rat model. The change of proteins in myocardial tissues was identified by proteomics and then further verified using western blotting. Additionally, metabolomics revealed the metabolic pathways associated with liver injury in CHF rats.Results and conclusionAnimal studies demonstrated that DBD could relieve CHF as it significantly reduced serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in CHF rats, and promoted the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), cytochrome oxidase (COX), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in myocardial tissues. Myocardial proteomics analysis revealed that DBD improved myocardial mitochondria and peroxisomes function by regulating the expression of proteins associated with energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Western blotting confirmed that DBD upregulated the expression of proteins in the adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 α)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPAR β) signaling pathway, which also proved the efficacy of DBD in alleviating CHF in rats. Hepatic metabolomics analysis showed that DBD could restore the damaged liver function of CHF rats via metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of lipid, vitamin, and amino acids. In conclusion, this study unveiled a novel action mechanism of DBD in the treating ISO-induced CHF and liver injury based on proteomics and metabolomics. These results lay a scientific basis for the widespread application of DBD in the cardiovascular field.",1
"ABSTRACTThe SWI/SNF complex is a chromatin remodeling complex comprised by several proteins such as SMARCA4 or SMARCB1. Mutations in its components can lead to the development of aggressive rhabdoid tumors such as epithelioid sarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor or small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type, among others. These malignancies tend to affect young patients and their prognosis is poor given the lack of effective treatments. Characteristically, these tumors are highly infiltrated by TILs, suggesting that some lymphocytes are recognizing tumor antigens. The use of those TILs as a therapeutic strategy is a promising approach worth exploring. Here, we report the clinical protocol of the TILTS study, a Phase II clinical trial assessing personalized adoptive cell therapy with TILs in patients affected by these tumor types.Clinical Trial Registration: 2023-504632-17-00 ( (ClinicalTrials.gov).","The cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP), a bromodomain-containing protein, engages with multiple transcription factors and enhances the activation of many genes. CBP bromodomain acts as an epigenetic reader and plays an important role in the CBP-chromatin interaction which makes it an important drug target for treating many diseases. Though inhibiting CBP bromodomain was reported to have great potential in cancer therapeutics, approved CBP bromodomain inhibitor is yet to come. We utilized various in silico approaches like molecular docking, ADMET, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM-PBSA calculations, and in silico PASS predictions to identify potential CBP bromodomain inhibitors from marine natural compounds as they have been identified as having distinctive chemical structures and greater anticancer activities. To develop a marine natural compound library for this investigation, Lipinski’s rule of five was used. Sequential investigations utilizing molecular docking, ADMET studies, 100 ns MD simulations, and MM-PBSA calculations revealed that three marine compounds—ascididemin, neoamphimedine, and stelletin A—demonstrated superior binding affinity compared to the standard inhibitor, 69 A. These compounds also exhibited suitable drug-like properties, a favorable safety profile, and formed stable protein-ligand complexes. The in-silico PASS tool predicted that these compounds have significant potential for anticancer activity. Among them, ascididemin demonstrated the highest binding affinity in both molecular docking and MM-PBSA calculations, as well as a better stability profile in MD simulations. Hence, ascididemin can be a potential inhibitor of CBP bromodomain. However, in vitro and in vivo validation is required for further confirmation of these findings.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00258-5.",0
"Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3) is a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein family expressed in the extracellular matrix closely associated with the development and occurrence of various malignant tumors; yet, its function in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is still poorly understood. The following study investigated the progress and mechanism of HAPLN3 on ccRCC using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments. In order to determine whether HAPLN3 is differentially expressed in ccRCC, we analyzed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE40435 and further validated them in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Simultaneously, the TCGA dataset was utilized to study the relationship between HAPLN3 expression and the progression of ccRCC and its prognostic value in ccRCC. Gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore HAPLN3-related signaling pathways in ccRCC. The TIMER database investigates the link for both HAPLN3 and immune cell infiltration. Different ccRCC cell lines the role of HAPLN3 on cell biological behavior in vitro. HAPLN3 was increased in ccRCC, and its high expression was related to the patients' survival rates and clinical characteristics. GSEA showed that HAPLN3 is mainly enriched in proliferative and metastatic pathways. In addition, HAPLN3 was an independently associated significant predictor in patients with ccRCC. Functional experiments demonstrated that HAPLN3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. To sum up, our data suggest that HAPLN3 may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.","BackgroundThe widespread use of oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (FOLFOX) in advanced gastric cancers is mainly based on clinical trials conducted at Western/European countries. The prospective data on efficacy and safety of FOLFOX in advanced gastric cancer is lacking from the developing countries. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of mFOLFOX-6 in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas, as first-line palliative chemotherapy.Methods Patients with previously untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach/GEJ, received mFOLFOX-6 (2 hours infusion of oxaliplatin [85 mg/m 2 ] and folinic acid [400 mg/m 2 ], followed by fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 intravenous push, then a 46-hour continuous infusion of 5-FU [2,400 mg/m 2 ]). Cycles were repeated every 2 weeks. The patients were prospectively followed up for response rates and toxicity. ResultsSixty-six patients were included in the study with a median age of 57 years. Sixty-two patients were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 53%, with a disease control rate (overall response and stable disease) of 81.8%. The median progression-free survival was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2–6.7 months) and the median overall survival was 11.5 months (95% CI 9.0–13.9 months). Ascites at presentation and more than one site of metastasis are associated with significantly lower survival on the log-rank test. Gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities were predominant, with rates of grade 3 to 4 nausea/vomiting (13.6%), anemia (15.1%), and neutropenia (13.6%). Among other toxicities, neurosensory toxicities were common. Four (6%) patients had grade 3 peripheral neuropathy.ConclusionmFOLFOX-6 is an active and well-tolerated chemotherapy regimen in advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach/GEJ. This regimen has similar response rates and treatment outcomes with lesser grade 3 or 4 toxicities than that of triplet regimens compared to historical studies.",0
"AbstractHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality; it ranks as the second most common cause of cancer deaths in China. Most HCC patients are first diagnosed at an advanced stage. In recent years, targeted therapy combined with immunotherapy has become the preferred regimen for systemic treatment of intermediate-advanced HCC, while targeted therapy combined with immunotherapy plus local treatment could further improve the efficacy in many clinical studies. To better guide the clinical treatment for effective and safe combination therapy, our interdisciplinary panel on the treatment of intermediate-advanced HCC comprising hepatologists, hepatobiliary surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, interventional radiologists, and traditional Chinese medicine physicians have formulated this consensus based on current clinical studies and clinical medication experience for reference. The consensus contained 15 recommendations, including the applicable population and management, local treatment selection, conversion strategy, treatment strategy after tumor progression and management of common adverse reactions.","BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.",0
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is incurable and prone to widespread metastasis. Therefore, identification of key targets for TNBC progression is urgently needed. Our previous study revealed that isotoosendanin (ITSN) reduced TNBC metastasis by targeting TGFβR1. ITSN is currently used as an effective chemical probe to further discover the key molecules involved in TNBC metastasis downstream of TGFβR1. The results showed that GOT2 was the gene downstream of Smad2/3 and that ITSN decreased GOT2 expression by abrogating the activation of the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling pathway through directly binding to TGFβR1. GOT2 was highly expressed in TNBC, and its knockdown decreased TNBC metastasis. However, GOT2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of ITSN on TNBC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. GOT2 interacted with MYH9 and hindered its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1, thereby reducing MYH9 ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, GOT2 also enhanced the translocation of MYH9 to mitochondria and thus induced DRP1 phosphorylation, thereby promoting mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells. ITSN-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation was associated with reduced GOT2 expression. In conclusion, ITSN prevented MYH9-regulated mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells by enhancing MYH9 protein degradation through a reduction in GOT2 expression, thus contributing to its inhibition of TNBC metastasis.","AbstractBackgroundPreclinical cancer studies ascribe promising anticancer properties to metformin. Yet, clinical findings vary, casting uncertainty on its therapeutic value for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We hypothesized that metformin could benefit obese and overweight patients with NSCLC.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 2 clinical cohorts and employed complementary mouse models to test our hypothesis. One cohort included NSCLC patients with overweight body mass index (≥25 kg/m2, n = 511) and nonoverweight body mass index (<25 kg/m2, n = 232) who underwent lobectomy, evaluating metformin’s impact on clinical outcomes. Another cohort examined metformin’s effect on progression-free survival after immune checkpoint inhibitors in overweight (n = 284) vs nonoverweight (n = 184) NSCLC patients. Metformin’s effects on tumor progression, antitumor immunity, and immune checkpoint inhibitor response in obese and normal-weight mice were assessed with lung cancer models.ResultsMetformin is associated with increased recurrence-free survival in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.94; P = .035) after lobectomy. It also corrected accelerated tumor growth in diet-induced obese mouse models in a lymphocyte-specific manner while reversing several mechanisms of immune suppression potentiated by obesity. Programmed cell death 1 blockade coupled with metformin was more effective at limiting tumor burden in obese mice and correlated with progression-free survival only in overweight patients on immunotherapy (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.93; P = .024).ConclusionsMetformin may improve lung cancer–specific clinical outcomes in obese and overweight lung cancer patients and enhance immunotherapy efficacy in this growing population. This work identifies obesity as a potential predictive biomarker of metformin’s anticancer and immunotherapy-enhancing properties in lung cancer while shedding light on the underlying immunological phenomena.",0
"Chromosome instability (CIN) and subsequent aneuploidy are prevalent in various human malignancies, influencing tumor progression such as metastases and relapses. Extensive studies demonstrate the development of chemoresistance in high-CIN tumors, which poses significant therapeutic challenges. Given the association of CIN with poorer prognosis and suppressed immune microenvironment observed in colorectal carcinoma (CRC), here we aimed to discover chemotherapeutic drugs exhibiting increased inhibition against high-CIN CRC cells. By using machine learning methods, we screened out two BCL-XL inhibitors Navitoclax and WEHI-539 as CIN-sensitive reagents in CRC. Subsequent analyses using a CIN-aneuploidy cell model confirmed the vulnerability of high-CIN CRC cells to these drugs. We further revealed the critical role of BCL-XL in the viability of high-CIN CRC cells. In addition, to ease the evaluation of CIN levels in clinic, we developed a three-gene signature as a CIN surrogate to predict prognosis, chemotherapeutic and immune responses in CRC samples. Our results demonstrate the potential value of CIN as a therapeutic target in CRC treatment and the importance of BCL-XL in regulating survival of high-CIN CRC cells, therefore representing a valuable attempt to translate a common trait of heterogeneous tumor cells into an effective therapeutic target.","Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat in the medical field. Machine learning (ML) has enabled in-depth analysis of complex patterns from large, diverse datasets, greatly facilitating “healthcare automation” in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Despite these advancements, ML models face challenges stemming from limited labeled sample sizes, the intricate interplay of high-dimensionality data types, the inherent heterogeneity observed among patients and within tumors, and concerns about interpretability and consistency with existing biomedical knowledge. One approach to address these challenges is to integrate biomedical knowledge into data-driven models, which has proven potential to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of model results. Here, we review the state-of-the-art ML studies that leverage the fusion of biomedical knowledge and data, termed knowledge-informed machine learning (KIML), to advance cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We provide an overview of diverse forms of knowledge representation and current strategies of knowledge integration into machine learning pipelines with concrete examples.

"BackgroundTo date, no comprehensive analysis of gallbladder cancer (GBC) management has been reported. We aimed to identify the publication characteristics and research trends in managing GBC over the past three decades.MethodsWe selected the 100 most cited articles and performed a bibliometric analysis to summarize the publication characteristics, explore research hotspots, and identify research trends in the management of GBC.ResultsThe total citations of the included articles ranged from 123 to 1822. Period II (2001–2010) yielded the highest number of included articles, whereas the lowest was in Period III (2011–2020). The United States and Japan published the most papers, in which the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center and Nagoya University were the leading institutions, respectively. The most influential authors were Blumgart LH and Fong YM from the United States. Cooperation among countries, institutions, and authors was weak. The Annals of Surgery contributed the most articles with the highest number of total citations. The most researched topic was surgery, followed by systemic therapy and adjuvant therapy. Since Period I, the percentage of surgery-related publications continuously decreased (Periods II and III versus Period I, both p < 0.001), with a concomitant increase in those of adjuvant therapy (Period III versus Period I, p = 0.004) and systemic therapy (Period II versus Period I, p = 0.004; Period III versus Period I, p = 0.002).ConclusionsSurgery remains the preferred treatment, while there is a tendency toward adjuvant and systemic therapy in GBC management. An increase in local and international collaboration for managing GBC is required.","PurposeWe aimed to investigate whether induction chemotherapy with less than four courses is as effective as induction chemotherapy with more than four courses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy.MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 249 patients with NSCLC who received chemoimmunotherapy at 12 centers in Japan between January and December 2019. The patient group that completed less than four courses owing to adverse events (AEs), and received subsequent maintenance therapy was compared to the group that received at least four courses of induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsOn univariate and multivariate analyses, the patient group that transitioned to maintenance therapy after completing less than four courses of induction chemotherapy had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those who completed at least four courses (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.38–3.37, p < 0.001 and HR 2.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.40–3.84, p = 0.001, respectively). There was no obvious difference in PFS between the group in which induction chemotherapy ended in two or three courses leading to partial or complete response, and the group that continued at least four courses of induction chemotherapy (log-rank test p = 0.53).ConclusionTreatment efficacy may be maintained if induction chemotherapy is completed in less than four courses owing to development of AEs, and is administered for more than two courses with partial or complete response; efficacy is maintained even on transitioning to maintenance therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03782-5.",0
"BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promising results in treating blood cancers, but it has limited efficacy against solid tumors that express mesothelin (MSLN). One of the reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which consists of physical barriers, multiple mechanisms of immune evasion, and various biochemical factors that favor tumor growth and survival. These factors reduce the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells in clinical trials. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to enhance the effectiveness of MSLN-targeted CAR T cell therapy.MethodsTo investigate whether the antitumor efficacy of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells depends on the epitopes they recognize, we generated MSLN-targeted CAR T cells that bind to different regions of MSLN (Region I, II, III and Full length). We then evaluated the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan or an anti-PD-1 antibody in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe found that MSLN-targeted CAR T cells effectively killed MSLN-positive cancer cells (H9, H226 and Panc-1), but not MSLN-negative cells (A431) in vitro. In a mouse model of H9 tumor xenografts, all CAR T cells showed similar tumor suppression, but an MSLN-targeted scFv with Region I epitope, R47, performed slightly better. Combining irinotecan with CAR_R47 T cells enhanced tumor control synergistically in both H9 xenograft mice and patient-derived xenograft mice.ConclusionsOur results suggest that irinotecan can enhance the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells, and offer a promising combination therapy strategy for MSLN-positive solid tumors.","Key Points•CD38-CAR NK and T cells showed enhanced killing toward CD38-expressing hematologic malignancies.•ATRA upregulates CD38, enhancing the activity of CD38-CAR NK cells against resistant CD38-low tumor cells.",0
"Oral cancer accounts for around 30 percent of all cancers in India. These cancers are usually managed either by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these modalities. Dental oncologists play an integral part in the multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists, nurses, physician assistants, nutritionists, psychologists and social workers to efficiently manage cancer patients. Oral complications associated with cancer therapy can range from minor mucositis or infections to severely debilitating conditions such as osteonecrosis of jaws, which can disrupt the ongoing cancer therapy and jeopardize the overall quality of life of the patient. This highlights the primary role of a dentist in the efficient identification and management of potential oral foci of infection and subsequent prevention of the onset of these complications. This necessitates accurate, evidence-based knowledge and extensive training of dental oncologists to provide state-of-the-art management strategies. This article aims to review oral management before, during and after therapy in patients undergoing treatment for cancers affecting the head and neck region.","PurposeOral cancer is a significant global health concern, with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in regions with prevalent tobacco usage such as Asia. Majority of oral cancers are detected at an advanced stage resulting in poor survival outcomes. Moreover, the treatment modalities of oral cancers have remained constant with surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy being mainstays of the treatment. This review provides a significant progress made in understanding the molecular landscape of oral cancers and the evolution of therapeutic strategies toward precision medicine.MethodsA comprehensive literature review was conducted to gather recent studies on the molecular landscape of oral cancers, genomic insights, and clinical trials.ResultsFirstly, genomic insights into oral cancers, including key driver mutations and copy number alterations, are discussed in the context of personalized medicine approaches. Subsequently, advancements in therapeutic strategies, particularly focusing on clinical trials investigating immunotherapy and targeted agents, are highlighted.ConclusionDespite promising results, challenges persist in identifying reliable biomarkers for treatment response and resistance. Continued research efforts are warranted to validate biomarkers and optimize therapeutic interventions, with the goal of enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of oral cancer.",1
"Aim: We aimed to investigate the predictive value of the Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) expression from circulating blood for recurrence, metastasis and overall death on patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Materials & Methods: We collected blood samples from 122 patients who were admitted to our hospital for NSCLC.Results: Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis in adjusted Model II showed that compared with GRHL2-negative expression, positive expression in patients with NSCLC was associated with increased death risk (HR = 7.0, 95% CI: 2.1–20.9, p = 0.03) and risk for composite end point (HR = 8.2, 95% CI: 4.0–27.1, p <0.01).Conclusion: This study supported that elevated circulating GRHL2 expression might be considered as a candidate prognostic biomarker for poor prognosis among these NSCLC patients.","IntroductionImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and has generated remarkable clinical results against multiple malignancies. Exploration of new technical approaches to further boost the therapeutic efficacy of ICB is of potential medical importance. In this study, we designed a novel nanotherapeutics for ICB immunotherapy.MethodsCTLA-4 aptamers were conjugated to the surface of albumin nanoparticle to construct an aptamer-modified nanostructure (Apt-NP). To improve ICB efficacy, fexofenadine (FEXO), an antihistamine, was encapsulated into Apt-NP to make a drug-loaded nanoparticle (Apt-NP-FEXO). The antitumor efficacies of Apt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsApt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO had average diameters of 149 nm and 159 nm, respectively. Similar to free CTLA-4 aptamers, Apt-modified NPs could selectively bind with CTLA-4 positive cells and improve lymphocyte-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity in vitro. In animal studies, compared with free CTLA-4 aptamer, Apt-NP significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Moreover, Apt-NP-FEXO further improved antitumor efficacy vs. Apt-NP in vivo.ConclusionThe results suggest that Apt-NP-FEXO represents a novel strategy to improve ICB outcome and may have application potential in cancer immunotherapy.",0
"Aptamers, synthetic single-strand oligonucleotides with a similar function to antibodies, are promising as therapeutics because of their minimal side effects. However, the stability and bioavailability of the aptamers pose a challenge. We developed aptamers converted from RNA aptamer to modified DNA aptamers targeting phospho-AXL with improved stability and bioavailability.Based on the comparative analysis of a library of 17 converted modified DNA aptamers, we selected aptamer candidates, GLB-G25 and GLB-A04 that exhibited highest bioavailability, stability and robust anti-tumor effect in vitro experiments.Backbone modifications such as thiophosphate or dithiophosphate and a covalent modification of the 5’-end of the aptamer with polyethylene glycol optimized the pharmacokinetic properties, improved the stability of the aptamers in vivo by reducing nuclease hydrolysis and renal clearance, and achieved high and sustained inhibition of AXL at a very low dose.Treatment with these modified aptamers in ovarian cancer orthotopic mouse models significantly reduced tumor growth and the number of metastases. This effective silencing of the phospho-AXL target thus demonstrated that aptamer specificity and bioavailability can be improved by chemical modification of existing aptamers for phospho-AXL. These results lay the foundation for translation of these aptamer candidates and companion biomarkers to the clinic.","Ovarian cancers are a complex and heterogenic group of malignancies that are difficult to detect, diagnose and treat. Fortunately, considerable knowledge of ovarian cancer specific biomarkers has been generated, that is pertinent to the development of novel theranostic platforms by combining therapies and diagnostics. Genomic and proteomic data has been invaluable in providing critical biomolecular targets for ovarian cancer theranostic approaches. Exploitation of the wealth of biomarker research that has been conducted offers viable targets as beacons for ovarian cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic targeting. These markers can be used in theranostics, a treatment strategy that combines therapy and diagnostics and is common in nuclear medicine, where radionuclides are used for both diagnosis and treatment. The development of theranostics has taken substantial focus in recent years in the battle against ovarian cancer. Yet to date only one theranostic technology has emerged in clinical practice. However, given the wealth of ovarian cancer biomarkers the field is poised to see the emergence of revolutionary disease treatment and monitoring outcomes through their incorporation into the development of theranostic strategies. The future of ovarian cancer treatment is set to enable precise diagnosis, targeted treatment, and vigilant monitoring. This review aims to assess the status of ovarian cancer diagnostic tools and biomarkers in practice, clinical development, or pre-clinical development, highlighting newly emerging theranostic applications.",1
"BackgroundPreviously, albendazole (ABZ) has been reported as an anti-parasitic drug rather than anti-tumor drug. Our study aim to investigate whether ABZ also has a potential anti-tumor effect by shaping the tumor immune microenvironment and interrogate whether ABZ could synergize with the PD-L1 blockade.MethodsC57BL/6 mice (C57) were intravenously injected with B16F10-luciferase (B16-luc) cells to establish a lung metastatic melanoma model and subcutaneously inoculated with B16-luc cells to establish a subcutaneous tumor model. The tumor volume and tumor metastasis loci of the mice were measured by a vernier caliper and in vivo imaging. RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the different genes and pathways of immune cells in the tumors. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the different subsets of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.ResultsThe results suggested that ABZ significantly inhibited lung melanoma metastasis with decreased fluorescence intensity and nodule score and mediated the regression of subcutaneous melanoma in mice with decreased tumor volume. Moreover, RNA sequencing results showed that ABZ regulated the gene expression levels and pathways of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Meanwhile, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence showed that the number and percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells were enhanced in tumors after ABZ treatment. Furthermore, the combination of ABZ and anti-PD-L1 treatment significantly potentiated anti-tumor efficacy in both lung metastasis and subcutaneous melanoma models and mediated an increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells as compared to the control group.ConclusionABZ inhibits melanoma growth and metastasis. Moreover, ABZ synergized with PD-L1 blockade mediates tumor regression.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05415-5.","The association of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) with melanoma has been well documented. Similarly, the outcome of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) in melanoma depends, to some extent, on the HLA genotype of the patient. Although specific favorable (or unfavorable) HLA alleles for CBI outcome for melanoma have been identified, there is currently no reliable way to predict a positive, neutral or negative melanoma CBI outcome for other alleles. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to identify HLA alleles whose frequency is negatively (or positively) associated with melanoma prevalence (protective or susceptibility alleles, respectively). The findings demonstrated that, indeed, HLA alleles that are negatively associated with melanoma prevalence in the population have been associated with good CBI outcome at the individual level and, conversely, HLA alleles that are positively associated with melanoma prevalence have been associated with poor CBI outcome in individuals. Given this good prediction of CBI cancer immunotherapy by specific immunogenetically discovered HLA alleles, we used this epidemiologic immunogenetic approach to identify more HLA Class I and II alleles protective (or susceptibility) for melanoma which would thus be good predictors of CBI outcomes in those cancers. This is a new approach to successfully (a) identify HLA protective or susceptibility alleles for melanoma, and (b) use that information in anticipating outcomes in CBI cancer immunotherapy.",1
"This cross-sectional study examines the association between Medicaid expansion following the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and changes in insurance status, cancer stage at diagnosis, and timely treatment among patients with incident breast, colon, and non–small cell lung cancer.","BACKGROUND:Endemic and pandemic infectious diseases take a substantial toll on human health. Advancing understanding about the determinants of protective immunity could provide avenues toward improved treatments for infections. In 1983, a small protein and presumptive antiviral “interferon,” IFN-γ, was characterized as a factor released by antigen-stimulated lymphocytes that equips macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Shortly thereafter, IFN-γ became the first cytokine used for host-directed therapy of a nonviral infectious disease in humans. The ensuing decades of research developed knowledge about the induction of IFN-γ and its downstream target genes; provided an understanding about individuals with IFN-γ–related genetic defects that render them susceptible to infections; and documented the therapeutic impact of endogenously produced and exogenously administered IFN-γ on infectious disease.ADVANCES:It is now known that IFN-γ is produced by various lymphocytes. IFN-γ released by these lymphoid populations can act on cells expressing IFN-γ receptor plus the kinases (Janus kinases 1 and 2) and transcription factor (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) needed for signaling in response to IFN-γ. Although IFN-γ was initially considered to regulate macrophages, hundreds of human cell types express the signaling machinery and may have the ability to respond to IFN-γ.The hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) elicited by IFN-γ encode a variety of proteins, including enzymes, ion channels, and pumps. These molecules promote oxidation, nitrosylation, and acidification of intracellular microbes residing in vacuoles; restrict the availability of host metabolites and metals on which pathogens depend; disrupt microbial membranes; impair microbial uptake into or exit from host cells; or promote eviction of microbial pathogens. Given the cytotoxic effects of some ISGs, numerous suppressors and antagonists regulate the action of IFN-γ. These include type I IFNs, which can reduce production of IFN-γ; transforming growth factor–β and interleukin-10, which block IFN-γ’s ability to activate macrophages; and regulatory T cells induced in part by IFN-γ itself.Although both knockout mice and people with inborn errors of IFN-γ immunity are susceptible to diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections, the nonredundant role of IFN-γ in human host defense is narrower than in artificially infected mice. Growing knowledge of “Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease” (MSMD) reveals it to be neither strictly Mendelian nor restricted to mycobacterial disease, to arise from genotypes in at least 21 loci that impair production of and/or responses to IFN-γ, and to be phenocopied by auto-antibodies that neutralize IFN-γ. Besides reinforcing the importance of IFN-γ for macrophage antimicrobial defense, MSMD studies have uncovered multiple new facets of human immunobiology, for example, that interferon-stimulated gene 15 secreted by granulocytes promotes IFN-γ secretion by natural killer cells, giving the host a way to activate macrophages without recourse to adaptive immunity. Lastly, beneficial clinical experience with administration of recombinant IFN-γ has been reported in >1100 patients for prophylaxis or treatment of diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections.OUTLOOK:We now have a wider view of what it means to be an “interferon,” the cells beyond macrophages that IFN-γ equips, and the opportunities to prevent or treat infections that IFN-γ offers. Patients deficient for IFN-γ production but who can respond to it are candidates for adjunctive IFN-γ treatment or prophylaxis. Such individuals include those with MSMD as well as those with other immunodeficiencies, for example, people with HIV/AIDS, certain cancers, advanced age, or a disease-selective defect in producing IFN-γ during infection.Clinical use of IFN-γ will benefit from a deeper knowledge of IFN-γ biology. For example, future work could help answer the following questions: How are new IFN-γ–dependent genes born and regulated? How widely do transposable elements and endogenous retroviruses serve as functional components in the promoters of IFN-γ–dependent ISGs? What are the roles and structures of many IFN-γ–induced ISGs whose biology remains mysterious? What are the contributions of ISGs that are negatively affected by IFN-γ? How do regulatory loops among different IFN responses affect the course of infections? Hopefully, we can use the answers to such questions to design novel approaches to kill or restrict microbes that cause serious disease or death in the human population. We may also help treat some infectious diseases with an exogenous source of antimicrobial molecules whose production IFN-γ normally induces in the host.",0
"Although obesity-related asthma is associated with worse asthma outcomes, optimal treatment approaches for this complex phenotype are still largely unavailable. This state-of-the-art review article synthesizes evidence for existing and emerging treatment approaches for obesity-related asthma and highlights pathways that offer potential targets for novel therapeutics. Existing treatments targeting insulin resistance and obesity, including metformin and GLP-1 (glucagon-like-peptide 1) receptor agonists, have been associated with improved asthma outcomes, although GLP-1R agonist data in asthma are limited to individuals with comorbid obesity. Monoclonal antibodies approved for treatment of moderate to severe asthma generally appear to be effective in individuals with obesity, although this is based on retrospective or secondary analysis of clinical trials; moreover, although most of these asthma biologics are approved for use in the pediatric population, the impact of obesity on their efficacy has not been well studied in youth. Potential therapeutic targets being investigated include IL-6, arginine metabolites, nitro-fatty acids, and mitochondrial antioxidants, with clinical trials for each currently underway. Potential therapeutic targets include adipose tissue eosinophils and the GLP-1–arginine–advanced glycation end products axis, although data in humans are still needed. Finally, transcriptomic and epigenetic studies of “obese asthma” demonstrate enrichment of IFN-related signaling pathways, Rho-GTPase pathways, and integrins, suggesting that these too could represent future treatment targets. We advocate for further study of these potential therapeutic mechanisms and continued investigation of the distinct inflammatory pathways characteristic of obesity-related asthma, to facilitate effective treatment development for this unique asthma phenotype.","ABSTRACTAutophagy, a lysosome-dependent protein degradation mechanism, is a highly conserved catabolic process seen in all eukaryotes. This cell protection system, which is present in all tissues and functions at a basic level, can be up- or downregulated in response to various stresses. A disruption in the natural route of the autophagy process is frequently followed by an interruption in the inherent operation of the body’s cells and organs. Probiotics are live bacteria that protect the host through various mechanisms. One of the processes through which probiotics exert their beneficial effects on various cells and tissues is autophagy. Autophagy can assist in maintaining host homeostasis by stimulating the immune system and affecting numerous physiological and pathological responses. In this review, we particularly focus on autophagy impairments occurring in several human illnesses and investigate how probiotics affect the autophagy process under various circumstances.Abbreviation: AD: Alzheimer disease; AKT: AKT serine/threonine kinase; AMPK: 5′AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy related; CCl4: carbon tetrachloride; CFS: cell-free supernatant; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CRC: colorectal cancer; EPS: L. plantarum H31 exopolysaccharide; HD: Huntington disease; HFD: high-fat diet; HPV: human papillomavirus; IFNG/IFN-γ: interferon gamma; IL6: interleukin 6; LGG: L. rhamnosus GG; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; PD: Parkinson disease; Pg3G: pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PolyQ: polyglutamine; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SCFAs: short-chain fatty acids; SLAB51: a novel formulation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria; Slp: surface layer protein (of acidophilus NCFM); SNCA: synuclein alpha; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase 1; YB: B. longum subsp. infantis YB0411; YFP: yeast fermentate prebiotic.",1
"AbstractBackgroundRacial and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in gynecologic cancer clinical trials despite disproportionately worse oncologic outcomes. Research shows differential racial enrollment patterns because of comorbidity-based exclusion criteria. Our objective was to evaluate contemporary trends in comorbidity-based exclusion criteria among National Cancer Institute–sponsored gynecologic cancer clinical trials and protocol adherence to broadened eligibility criteria guidelines as an assessment of equitable enrollment access.MethodsThe ClinicalTrials.gov registry was queried for National Cancer Institute–sponsored gynecologic cancer clinical trials (1994-2021). Study characteristics and comorbidity-based exclusion criteria were abstracted from protocols. Descriptive statistics and temporal trends were calculated using χ2 testing with STATA v17 software.ResultsAmong 279 clinical trials identified, 65% completed enrollment, 53% were phase II, and 48% focused on ovarian cancer. Pharmaceutical agents (85%) were the primary therapeutic interventions. Several inequitably restrictive exclusion criteria increased over time such as hepatitis infection (17% in 1994-2000 vs 49% in 2015-2021, P < .001) and cardiovascular disease (47% in 1994-2000 vs 66% in 2015-2021, P = .002). A previously rare exclusion, “mental illness and/or social situations,” dramatically increased from 5% to 51% (P < .001) over 3 decades. Adherence to broadened eligibility criteria recommendations was mixed. Renal function, cardiovascular disease, and performance status criteria were not broadened, but HIV, prior or concurrent malignancies, and brain metastasis criteria were.ConclusionsSome, but not all, of the known restrictive comorbidity-based exclusion criteria have increased in gynecologic cancer clinical trial design, despite calls for improving racial and ethnic minority representation. Exclusion criteria are critical for trial safety, however, they must be carefully considered given the differential racial impact on eligibility.","AimTo describe a 10-year follow-up of children (<16y) with acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) from a UK-wide prospective surveillance study.MethodDiagnoses were retrieved from the patients’ records via the patients’ paediatric or adult neurologist using a questionnaire. Demyelinating phenotypes at follow-up were classified by an expert review panel.ResultsTwenty-four out of 125 (19.2%) children (64 males, 61 females; median age 10y, range 1y 4mo–15y 11mo), identified in the original study, were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (incidence of 2.04/million children/year); 23 of 24 fulfilled 2017 McDonald criteria at onset. Aquaporin-4-antibody neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders were diagnosed in three (2.4%, 0.26/million children/year), and relapsing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease in five (4%, 0.43/million children/year). Three out of 125 seronegative patients relapsed and 85 of 125 (68%) remained monophasic over 10 years. Five of 125 patients (4%) originally diagnosed with ADS were reclassified during follow-up: three children diagnosed initially with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were subsequently diagnosed with acute necrotising encephalopathy (RAN-binding protein 2 mutation), primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (Munc 13-4 gene inversion), and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. One child initially diagnosed with optic neuritis was later diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency, and one presenting with transverse myelitis was subsequently diagnosed with Sjögren syndrome.InterpretationThe majority of ADS presentations in children are monophasic, even at 10-year follow-up. Given the implications for treatment strategies, multiple sclerosis and central nervous system autoantibody mimics warrant extensive investigation.",0
"PurposeTo investigate the prognostic value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).MethodsThe medical records of HCC patients treated with SBRT between 2008 and 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. The NLR and PLR were calculated from the serum complete blood count before and after SBRT, and the prognostic values of the NLR and PLR for the treatment outcomes were evaluated.ResultsThirty-nine patients with 49 HCC lesions were included. After a median follow-up of 26.8 months (range, 8.4-80.0 months), three-year local control, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 97.4%, 78.3%, and 35.2%, respectively. Both NLR and PLR increased significantly after SBRT and decreased slowly to the pre-SBRT value at 6 months. Univariable analysis showed that gross tumor volume (GTV) >14 cc, post-SBRT PLR >90, and PLR change >30 were associated with a poorer OS (p=0.002, p=0.011, and p=0.001, respectively), and the PLR change was significant in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 10.09; 95% CI, 1.15-88.40; p=0.037). For PFS, GTV >14 cc, post-SBRT NLR >2.5 and post-SBRT PLR >90 were predictive of a poorer PFS in univariable analysis (p=0.011, p=0.004 and p=0.041, respectively) and only post-SBRT NLR >2.5 remained significant in multivariable analysis (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.03-5.76; p=0.042, respectively).ConclusionsThe NLR and PLR increased transiently after SBRT, and the post-SBRT NLR and PLR were associated with the clinical outcomes of HCC patients.","N6 methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), has been extensively studied in recent years. Dysregulation of m6A and its associated machinery (including “writers”, “erasers” and “readers”) has been frequently observed in various cancer types, and their dysregulation profiles may serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers. The dysregulated m6A modifiers have been shown to function as oncogenes or tumour suppressors, and play essential roles in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, metabolism, drug resistance, and immune evasion, as well as in cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumour microenvironment, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the dysregulated m6A machinery for cancer treatment. In this review, we illustrate the mechanisms by which m6A modifiers interplay and orchestrate the fate of target RNAs. We also describe the state-of-the-art methodologies for mapping global m6A in cancer epitranscriptomes. We further summarize the recent discoveries regarding the dysregulations of m6A and the associated machinery in cancers and their pathological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms in cancers. Finally, we discuss the findings on m6A related molecules as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers, as well as the recent development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting oncogenic m6A modifiers and their preclinical results in treating cancers.",0
"AbstractCancer immunotherapy is used to treat tumors by modulating the immune system. Although the anticancer efficacy of cancer immunotherapy has been evaluated prior to clinical trials, conventional in vivo animal and endpoint models inadequately replicate the intricate process of tumor elimination and reflect human‐specific immune systems. Therefore, more sophisticated models that mimic the complex tumor‐immune microenvironment must be employed to assess the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Additionally, using real‐time imaging technology, a step‐by‐step evaluation can be applied, allowing for a more precise assessment of treatment efficacy. Here, an overview of the various imaging‐based evaluation platforms recently developed for cancer immunotherapeutic applications is presented. Specifically, a fundamental technique is discussed for stably observing immune cell‐based tumor cell killing using direct imaging, a microwell that reproduces a confined space for spatial observation, a droplet assay that facilitates cell–cell interactions, and a 3D microphysiological system that reconstructs the vascular environment. Furthermore, it is suggested that future evaluation platforms pursue more human‐like immune systems.","PurposeProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) are considered predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in cervical cancer. However, their expression in primary tumors and metastases does not always match affecting the course of treatment. We investigated the consistency of their expression in primary and matched recurrent/metastatic lesions from patients with cervical cancer.MethodsPrimary and matched recurrent/metastatic specimens from patients with recurrent cervical cancer (n = 194) were stained for PD-L1 and MMR (MLHI, MSH6, MSH2, and PMS2) using immunohistochemistry. The degree of consistency of PD-L1 and MMR expression in these lesions was analyzed.ResultsThe inconsistency rate of PD-L1 expression in primary and recurrent/metastatic lesions was 33.0%, and it varied between the recurrence sites. Positive PD-L1 rate in primary lesions was lower (15.4%) than that in recurrent/metastatic lesions (30.4%). The discordance rate of MMR expression between primary and recurrent/metastatic lesions was 4.1%.ConclusionWe conclude that to use PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy, analysis of both metastatic and primary lesions may be required. High consistency rate of MMR expression between primary and metastatic lesions suggests that testing primary lesions alone can be sufficient for guiding the course of therapy, thereby solving the difficulty of obtaining recurrent/metastatic specimens in clinic.",0
"PurposeTo compare the toxicity and clinical efficacy of TL (docetaxel + lobaplatin) induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy and TPF (docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Methods and patientsIn total, 128 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled between August 2016 and April 2021. They were randomly divided into trial group and control group, all using chronological dosage mode. The trial group used TL regimen induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy; the control group used TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The endpoints were adverse events and survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years.ResultsMedian follow-up was 42 months (20–71 months).  Adverse events: During induction chemotherapy, compared with TPF group, grade 3–4 leukocytes and neutrophils, diarrhea, 1–2 hyperbilirubinemia, nausea / vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, hyponatremia were significantly lower in TL group (p<0. 05): 6% vs. 35%, 14% vs. 53%, 0% vs. 6%, 15% vs. 40%, 9% vs. 56%, 0% vs. 10%, 3% vs. 13%, 2% vs. 23%, 15% vs. 74%. During chemoradiotherapy, the incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalaemia and grade 1–2 nausea was significantly lower in the TL group (p<0. 05), with 24% vs. 69%, 20% vs. 65% and 24% vs. 44%, respectively. However, more grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia were observed in the TL group (15% vs. 3%, p<0. 05).  There was no significant difference in the recent objective response rate (ORR) between patients with TL group and TPF group (p=0.961).  There was no statistical difference in 1, 3 and 5 years OS between TL group and TPF group, respectively, (71.0% vs. 67.5%, p=0.573), (56.6% vs. 56.9%, p=0.814), (52.5% vs. 52.9%, p=0.841); 1, 3 and 5 years PFS are: (63.4% vs. 64.0%, p=0.883), (51.1% vs. 54.0%, p=0.705) and (47.3% vs. 45.9%, p=0.887), None of them were significantly different. Multivariate analysis of COX regression showed that T stage (p=0.01) and surgery (p=0.046) were independent factors affecting PFS and OS, respectively. OS subgroup analysis shows that people receiving the TL regimen in postoperative and nodal stage N1 and N2 patients tended to survive longer than those receiving the TPF regimen.ConclusionPatients with postoperative, N1 or N2 stage locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may have more significant clinical benefits when treated with TL regimen. TL regimen has advantages in reducing toxic side effects and can be used as one of the first-line treatment options.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03117257).","BackgroundThe advantages of radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) depend on the radiation sensitivity of the patient. Here, we established and verified radiological factor-related gene signature and built a prognostic risk model to predict whether radiotherapy would be beneficial.MethodsData from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus, and RadAtlas databases were subjected to LASSO regression, univariate COX regression, and multivariate COX regression analyses to integrate genomic and clinical information from patients with HNSCC. HNSCC radiation-related prognostic genes were identified, and patients classified into high- and low-risk groups, based on risk scores. Variations in radiation sensitivity according to immunological microenvironment, functional pathways, and immunotherapy response were investigated. Finally, the expression of HNSCC radiation-related genes was verified by qRT-PCR.ResultsWe built a clinical risk prediction model comprising a 15-gene signature and used it to divide patients into two groups based on their susceptibility to radiation: radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant. Overall survival was significantly greater in the radiation-sensitive than the radiation-resistant group. Further, our model was an independent predictor of radiotherapy response, outperforming other clinical parameters, and could be combined with tumor mutational burden, to identify the target population with good predictive value for prognosis at 1, 2, and 3 years. Additionally, the radiation-resistant group was more vulnerable to low levels of immune infiltration, which are significantly associated with DNA damage repair, hypoxia, and cell cycle regulation. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion scores also suggested that the resistant group would respond less favorably to immunotherapy.ConclusionsOur prognostic model based on a radiation-related gene signature has potential for application as a tool for risk stratification of radiation therapy for patients with HNSCC, helping to identify candidates for radiation therapy and overcome radiation resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05304-x.",1
"We describe diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in this rare entity of CD20-negative B cell lymphomas. They comprise only 1 to 2% of all B cell lymphoma with four subcategories. However, with an increasing understanding of these cases, novel entities have been recognized. Workup, treatment, and follow-up of two CD20-negative B cell lymphoma cases, including a novel entity, have been described. A novel case of triple expresser CD20-negative B cell lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma has been diagnosed. The absence of CD20 leads to the abolishment of the targeted drug (rituximab) from the treatment regimen. These cases render the importance of extensive immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization workup for diagnosis of this rare entity. Treatment also remains a challenge as immunotherapy with CD20-targeted drugs cannot be given.","AbstractApigenin, a potent natural flavonoid, has emerged as a key therapeutic agent due to its multifaceted medicinal properties in combating various diseases. However, apigenin's clinical utility is greatly limited by its poor water solubility, low bioavailability and stability issues. To address these challenges, this review paper explores the innovative field of nanotechnology-based delivery systems, which have shown significant promise in improving the delivery and effectiveness of apigenin. This paper also explores the synergistic potential of co-delivering apigenin with conventional therapeutic agents. Despite the advantageous properties of these nanoformulations, critical challenges such as scalable production, regulatory approvals and comprehensive long-term safety assessments remain key hurdles in their clinical adoption which must be addressed for commercialization of apigenin-based formulations.",0
"Systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) for tissue-specific targeting using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) holds great therapeutic potential. Nevertheless, how the structural characteristics of ionizable lipids (lipidoids) impact their capability to target cells and organs remains unclear. Here we engineered a class of siloxane-based ionizable lipids with varying structures and formulated siloxane-incorporated LNPs (SiLNPs) to control in vivo mRNA delivery to the liver, lung and spleen in mice. The siloxane moieties enhance cellular internalization of mRNA-LNPs and improve their endosomal escape capacity, augmenting their mRNA delivery efficacy. Using organ-specific SiLNPs to deliver gene editing machinery, we achieve robust gene knockout in the liver of wild-type mice and in the lungs of both transgenic GFP and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumour-bearing mice. Moreover, we showed effective recovery from viral infection-induced lung damage by delivering angiogenic factors with lung-targeted Si5-N14 LNPs. We envision that our SiLNPs will aid in the clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics for next-generation tissue-specific protein replacement therapies, regenerative medicine and gene editing.","BackgroundMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin with high mortality. However, its clinical characteristics in Asian patients remain uncertain owing to its low incidence.ObjectiveTo analyze the clinicopathological features of MCC and identify factors associated with its prognosis.MethodsThe medical records of 62 patients with MCC were retrospectively reviewed. Data on clinical features, survival outcomes, prognostic factors, histopathology and immunohistochemical profile of the patients were collected and analyzed. Merkel cell polyomavirus status was evaluated using immunohistochemistry.ResultsThe incidence of MCC significantly increased over time. The mean duration of follow-up was 51.2 months, with an overall 5-year survival of 80.6%. More female patients with MCC were identified than male patients (1.3:1). Approximately half of the patients had stage I disease at the time of initial presentation. The primary tumor was frequently located in the lower extremities (40.3%), followed by the head and neck (32.3%), upper extremities (22.6%), and the trunk (4.8%). Male sex was associated with poorer overall survival (p = 0.003). Post-resection adjuvant radiotherapy significantly improved the overall survival (p = 0.023). Sentinel lymph node biopsy during surgery ameliorated the progression-free survival (p = 0.036) in patients with stage I or II cancer. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion were associated with a poor prognosis. Old age, immunohistochemical profiles, and Merkel cell polyomavirus-positivity were not associated with prognosis.ConclusionPost-surgical adjuvant radiotherapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy significantly improve the course of MCC.",0
"Cadmium is a well-known toxic heavy metal that poses significant health risks, particularly through inhalation, smoking, and the consumption of contaminated food. Exposure to cadmium is linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the systemic effects of intratracheal cadmium chloride (0.5 mg/kg) instillation in C57BL/6 mice. All parameters, including inflammation assessment, lung function evaluation (using Flexi-vent), and immunophenotyping of T-cells in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes), were analyzed 14 days after Cd exposure. The results demonstrated that cadmium exposure led to significant immune cell infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, altered pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and was associated with impaired lung function, characterized by increased lung resistance and Newtonian resistance. Analysis of T-cell populations revealed no significant changes in total T-cells in mediastinal lymph nodes and spleen, but a decrease in CD4+ T-cells and an increase in CD8+ T-cells were observed. These findings suggest that cadmium disrupts T-cell homeostasis in secondary lymphoid organs. Further research is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced lung injury and immune dysregulation, essential for developing effective therapeutic interventions against chronic lung diseases caused by cadmium exposure.","P2 purinergic receptor expression is dysregulated in multiple cancer subtypes and is associated with worse outcomes. Studies identify roles for P2 purinergic receptors in tumor cells that drive disease aggressiveness. There is also sufficient evidence that P2 purinergic receptor expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for disease initiation and progression. Immune cells constitute a significant component of the TME and display both tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic potential. Studies pre-dating the investigation of P2 purinergic receptors in cancer identify P2 receptor expression on multiple immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, T-cells, and dendritic cells; all of which are implicated in tumor initiation, tumor promotion, or response to treatment. Herein, we discuss P2 purinergic receptor expression and function in tumor-related immune cells. We provide a rationale for further investigations of P2 purinergic receptors within the TME to better define the mechanistic pathways of inflammation-mediate tumorigenesis and explore P2 purinergic receptors as potential targets for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.",1
"Evolving evidence indicates that tumor cells can transdifferentiate between distinct transcriptionally-determined cell states with changes in resultant phenotypes, a phenomenon known as cellular plasticity. These transitions are not driven by genetic mutations and typically in contrast to normal developmental processes, may proceed bidirectionally. Here, we review the role of cellular plasticity in the aggressive childhood solid tumor, neuroblastoma. We discuss the detection of two cell states, termed mesenchymal (MES) and adrenergic (ADRN), their properties and the transcriptional circuitries that control them, their relation to the normal embryogenesis of the sympathetic nervous system and their potential role in drug resistance, escape from therapy and development of relapse.","Purpose:We evaluate the efficacy and safety of UGN-102 chemoablation for the primary treatment of patients with recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.Materials and Methods:ENVISION is an ongoing, multinational, single-arm, phase 3 study in patients with a biopsy-proven recurrence of untreated low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients received 6 weekly intravesical instillations of UGN-102 (mitomycin; outpatient setting) and were evaluated at 3 months. Patients achieving complete response (CR; negative cystoscopic examination, cytology, and for-cause biopsy) were surveilled regularly until recurrence, progression, or death. Patients who remain disease-free will be followed up to 5 years, and further results will be reported in the future.Results:Of 240 patients enrolled, 228 (95%) received all 6 planned doses; 191 (80%; 95% CI, 73.9-84.5) achieved CR at 3 months, with an 82% (95% CI, 75.9-87.1) probability of response 12 months later. Median duration of response was not estimable over a median 13.9-month follow-up period. The most common adverse events (≥5.0% of patients) were dysuria, hematuria, UTI, pollakiuria, fatigue, and urinary retention; generally mild/moderate and resolved/resolving. Serious adverse events were observed in 29/240 (12.1%); 2 were treatment related (urinary retention/urethral stenosis), and both resolved.Conclusions:Primary chemoablation with UGN-102 in patients with recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer resulted in an 80% CR rate. Patients achieving a CR had an 82% likelihood of remaining disease-free 1 year later. The benefit-risk profile was favorable, supporting UGN-102 as a nonsurgical alternative for transurethral resection of bladder tumors in this patient population. Limitations of this study included lack of tumor sizing after the diagnostic biopsy.Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05243550",0
"BackgroundT cells have been proven to play important roles in anti-tumor and tumor microenvironment shaping, while these roles have not been explained in bladder cancer (BLCA).MethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to screen T-cell marker genes. Bulk RNA-sequencing data and clinical information from BLCA patients were downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database to develop a prognosis signature. We analyzed the association of different risk groups with survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and immunotherapy response.ResultsBased on 192 T-cell marker genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis, we constructed a prognostic signature containing 7 genes in the training cohort, which was further validated in the testing cohort and GEO cohort. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 1-, 3-, and 5 years were 0.734, 0.742 and 0.726 in the training cohort, 0.697, 0.671 and 0.670 in the testing cohort, 0.702, 0.665 and 0.629 in the GEO cohort, respectively. In addition, we constructed a nomogram based on clinical factors and the risk score of the signature. The low-risk group exhibited higher immune-related pathways, immune cell infiltration and TMB levels. Importantly, immunophenotype score and immunotherapy cohort (IMvigor210) analyses showed that the low-risk group had better immunotherapy response and prognosis.ConclusionsOur study reveals a novel prognostic signature based on T-cell marker genes, which provides a new target and theoretical support for BLCA patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04881-1.","PurposeIn recent times, multiple molecular subtypes with varying prognoses have been identified in bladder cancer (BLCA). However, the attributes of butyrate metabolism-related (BMR) molecular subtypes and their correlation with immunotherapy response remain inadequately explored in BLCA.MethodsWe utilized 594 samples of BLCA to investigate the molecular subtypes mediated by BMR genes and their correlation with the immunotherapy response. To quantify the BMR features of individual tumors, we developed a BMR score through the COX and LASSO regression methods. Clinical-related, tumor microenvironment, drug-sensitive and immunotherapy analyses were used to comprehensively analyze BMR scores.ResultsTwo distinct molecular subtypes related to butyrate metabolism were identified in BLCA, each with unique prognostic implications and immune microenvironments. BMR score was constructed based on 7 BMR genes and was used to classify the patients into two score groups. Clinical analysis revealed that the BMR score was an independent prognostic factor. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. The BMR score can also predict tumor immunity. The results demonstrated that a low BMR score was associated with higher efficacy of immunotherapy, which was also validated by an external dataset.ConclusionOur study proposes both molecular subtypes and a BMR-based score as promising prognostic classifications in BLCA. These findings may offer new insights for the development of precise targeted cancer therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05067-5.",1
"AbstractObjectivesBreast sensation following autologous breast reconstruction impacts patients’ quality of life. Although spontaneous reinnervation in free flaps was documented by many authors, there are efforts to further improve restoration of breast sensation. Interestingly, animal studies indicated that trastuzumab has several beneficial effects on transected peripheral nerves. Our aim was to compare spontaneous sensory recovery after free TRAM flap breast reconstruction between patients who were and were not treated with trastuzumab.MethodsThe study included 14 subjects who underwent tactile sensation examination in 5-year period after noninnervated free muscle-sparing TRAM flap breast reconstruction at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. Small and large flap skin islands and contralateral healthy breasts were tested with Semmes-Weinstein type monofilaments. Three sensory scores were created to more accurately compare breast sensation.ResultsIn subjects receiving trastuzumab, sensory recovery earlier extended to at least four of five large skin island regions and was always present in the central flap area in comparison with subjects who were not administered trastuzumab (p=0.0476). As indicated by total sensory scores, trastuzumab-treated subjects restored sensation better resembling healthy control breasts (54 vs. 39 % in large skin islands; 95 vs. 71 % in small skin islands).ConclusionsTo the authors’ knowledge, the current study for the first time demonstrated trastuzumab’s potential to improve sensory outcomes in human. Our results support the strategy that accelerated nerve regeneration is a key to more successful reinnervation. HER2 and EGFR inhibitors emerge as new candidates for pharmacological interventions in peripheral nerve injury treatment.","PurposeEarly biochemical recurrence (eBCR) indicated a high risk for potential recurrence and metastasis in prostate cancer. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification played an important role in prostate cancer progression. This study aimed to develop a m6A lncRNA signature to accurately predict eBCR in prostate cancer.MethodsPearson correlation analysis was first conducted to explore m6A lncRNAs and univariate Cox regression analysis was further performed to identify m6A lncRNAs of prognostic roles for predicting eBCR in prostate cancer. The m6A lncRNA signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis (LASSO) in training cohort and further validated in test cohort. Furthermore, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were utilized to explore potential effective drugs for high-risk group in this study.ResultsFive hundred and thirty-eighth m6A lncRNAs were searched out through Pearson correlation analysis and 25 out of 538 m6A lncRNAs were identified to pose prediction roles for eBCR in prostate cancers. An m6A lncRNA signature including 5 lncRNAs was successfully built in training cohort. The high-risk group derived from m6A lncRNA signature could efficiently predict eBCR occurrence in both training (p < 0.001) and test cohort (p = 0.002). ROC analysis also confirmed that lncRNA signature in this study posed more accurate prediction roles for eBCR occurrence when compared with PSA, TNM stages and Gleason scores. Drug sensitivity analysis further discovered that various drugs could be potentially utilized to treat high-risk samples in this study. ConclusionsThe m6A lncRNA signature in this study could be utilized to efficiently predict eBCR occurrence, various clinical characteristic and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04040-y.",0
"AbstractCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines reduce severe disease and mortality and may lessen transmission, measured by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load (VL). Evaluating vaccine associations in VL at COVID-19 diagnosis in 4 phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled vaccine trials, July 2020 to July 2021, VL reductions were 2.78 log10 copies/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–4.18; n = 60 placebo, 11 vaccine) and 2.12 log10 copies/mL (95% CI, 1.44–2.80; n = 594 placebo, 36 vaccine) for NVX-CoV2373 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Associations were not significant for AZD1222 (0.59 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, −.19 to 1.36; n = 90 placebo, 78 vaccine) or Ad26.COV2.S (0.23 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, −.01 to .47; n = 916 placebo, 424 vaccine). Thus, vaccines potentially decreased transmission when ancestral SARS-CoV-2 predominated. Clinical Trials Registration.

However, inhibiting HDACs—an effective treatment for lymphomas—has shown limited success in solid tumors. We report the discovery of a class of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) that demonstrates exquisite selective cytotoxicity against human HCC cells. The lead compound STR-V-53  showed a favorable safety profile in mice and robustly suppressed tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of HCC. When combined with the anti-HCC drug sorafenib, STR-V-53, showed greater in vivo efficacy. Moreover, STR-V-53 combined with anti-PD1 therapy increased the CD8+ to regulatory T-cell (Treg) ratio and survival in an orthotopic HCC model in immunocompetent mice. This combination therapy resulted in durable responses in 40% of the mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that STR-V-53 primed HCC cells to immunotherapy through HDAC inhibition, impaired glucose-regulated transcription, impaired DNA synthesis, upregulated apoptosis, and stimulated the immune response pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the novel HDACi STR-V-53 is an effective anti-HCC agent that can induce profound responses when combined with standard immunotherapy.",0
"Aim: Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized treatment of metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Our goal was to assess for an association between immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and clinical outcomes for patients on ICIs.Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 110 HNSCC patients who received ICI therapy at the University of Virginia.Results: On review, 48% of our patients experienced an irAE with the most common events being hypothyroidism (30%), dermatitis (14%) and hepatitis (11%). Women were more likely to experience irAEs. Treatment interruption/discontinuation occurred in 43% patients with irAEs. Development of irAEs was associated with superior objective response rate (68 vs. 39%, p = 0.009), with a greater rate of CR (17 vs. 5%) and PR (32 vs. 16%). Twelve patients underwent ICI re-treatment following irAE, with 17% attaining a complete disease response, 25% attaining a partial response, 33% achieving stable disease and 25% experiencing disease progression with ICI resumption.Conclusion: Development of irAE was associated with superior objective response rate, with a greater rate of CR and PR. ICI re-treatment following irAE was feasible in a significant proportion of patients and can be attempted in carefully selected patients, given the dearth of second-line therapies for these patients.","AbstractBackgroundThis investigator-initiated phase II trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (CaboNivoIpi) in previously treated patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.MethodsEligible patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who progressed on 1 prior line of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy received a 2-week run-in of cabozantinib monotherapy followed by CaboNivoIpi for 4 cycles (cycle length = 6 weeks), followed by cabozantinib plus nivolumab (cycle length = 4 weeks) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) within the first 6 months of treatment. A Simon optimal 2-stage design allowed for an interim analysis after accrual of 10 evaluable patients. At least 5 responses were needed to proceed to stage 2.ResultsAmong 11 patients enrolled, the median age was 69 years. Prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapies included lenvatinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib plus everolimus. Median follow-up was 13.4 months. Among 10 evaluable patients, ORR within the first 6 months of treatment was 10% (1 partial response). Median progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI, 3.0–not reached) and median overall survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 4.6–not reached). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were noted in 55% (6/11) and grade 5 AEs in 18% (2/11) of patients. The most common treatment-related AE was hypertension.

"Although deubiquitinases (DUBs) have been well described in liver tumorigenesis, their potential roles and mechanisms have not been fully understood. In this study, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) as an oncogene with essential roles during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. USP1, with elevated expression levels and clinical significance, was identified as a hub DUB for HCC in multiple bioinformatics datasets. Functionally, USP1 overexpression significantly enhanced the malignant behaviors in HCC cell lines and spheroids in vitro, as well as the zebrafish model and the xenograft model in vivo. In contrast, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP1 dramatically impaired the phenotypes of HCC cells. Specifically, ectopic USP1 enhanced aggressive properties and metabolic reprogramming of HCC cells by modulating mitochondrial dynamics. Mechanistically, USP1 induced mitochondrial fission by enhancing phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 via deubiquitination and stabilization of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which could be degraded by the E3 ligase NEDD4L. The USP1/CDK5 modulatory axis was activated in HCC tissues, which was correlated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, Prasugrel was identified as a candidate USP1 inhibitor for targeting the phenotypes of HCC by an extensive computational study combined with experimental validations. Taken together, USP1 induced malignant phenotypes and metabolic reprogramming by modulating mitochondrial dynamics in a CDK5-mediated Drp1 phosphorylation manner, thereby deteriorating HCC progression.","The pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is an essential component of the activation of the necroptotic pathway. Emerging evidence suggests that MLKL plays a key role in liver disease. However, how MLKL contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we report that MLKL is upregulated in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced murine HCC model and is associated with human hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocyte-specific MLKL knockout suppresses the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis. Conversely, MLKL overexpression aggravates the initiation and progression of DEN-induced HCC. Mechanistic study reveals that deletion of MLKL significantly increases the activation of autophagy, thereby protecting against hepatocarcinogenesis. MLKL directly interacts with AMPKα1 and inhibits its activity independent of its necroptotic function. Mechanistically, MLKL serves as a bridging molecule between AMPKα1 and protein phosphatase 1B (PPM1B), thus enhancing the dephosphorylation of AMPKα1. Consistently, MLKL expression correlates negatively with AMPKα1 phosphorylation in HCC patients. Taken together, our findings highlight MLKL as a novel AMPK gatekeeper that plays key roles in inhibiting autophagy and driving hepatocarcinogenesis, suggesting that the MLKL-AMPKα1 axis is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.",1
"PurposeWe aimed to assess the predictive value of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) therapy using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted at Seoul National University Hospital. Patients with EGFR/ALK-wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received ICBs between December 2013 and December 2019 were enrolled. Patients with archived blood samples collected prior to ICB treatment were assigned to the ELISA cohort. In addition, those with tissue samples from sites of recurrence or metastasis were assigned to an IHC cohort. Then, we analyzed Gal-3 expression in both cohorts.ResultsFifty-six patients in the ELISA cohort were grouped into low (N = 36) and high (N = 20) groups, using the mean Gal-3 ELISA level (13.24 pg/ml) as a cutoff. The high group demonstrated trends toward reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (0.9 vs. 3.7 months, p = 0.196) and significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (1.6 vs. 12.3 months, p = 0.018) than the low group. We categorized 94 patients in the IHC cohort into negative (N = 31) and positive (N = 63) groups based on Gal-3 IHC positivity. However, the median PFS (4.6 vs. 4.6 months for the negative vs. positive IHC group, respectively, p = 0.345) and OS (16.4 vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.137) were not significantly different.ConclusionHigh blood Gal-3 levels may predict inferior survival in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with ICBs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04275-9.","BackgroundCD177, an indicator of prognosis in diverse cancers, is involved in the physiological processes of various tumor cells, and acts as an immune molecule with novel functions in cancer pathogenesis. However, the diagnostic, prognostic, and immunological role of CD177 in cervical cancer remains unclear.MethodsUtilizing publicly available databases and integrating several bioinformatics analysis methods, we evaluated the expression level of CD177 in cervical cancer by GENT2, HPA, and GEO databases. And the experiments of western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to test the hypothesis. The Kaplan–Meier Plotter database, Xena Shiny, and the constructed nomogram were clearly demonstrated its prognostic value for patients. Gene set enrichment analysis explored the relationship between CD177 and cervical cancer immune responses and immune cells infiltration level. In addition, we investigated the association between CD177 expression and stromal score, immune score, immune checkpoint, and drug sensitivity by TCGA RNA-seq data.ResultsCD177 was apparently expressed at low levels in cervical cancer and predicted a poor survival rate for patients. CD177 significantly activated immune-related signaling pathways and had a positive relationship with immune cell infiltration level. The high CD177 expression group possessed the high stromal score and immune score. CD177 had potential interactions with CTLA4, CD27, BLTA, CD200R1, CD80, NRP1, TNFRSF25, TIGIT, ICOS, and TNFSF9 checkpoint markers. And CD177 expression was positively relevant with drug sensitivity for Lapatinib, Belinostat, ATRA, Gefitinib, Navitoclax, and Tamoxifen.SignificanceThese findings may shed light on the vital role of CD177 in cervical cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and immunological functions, and it may be a promising predictor and potential factor for cervical cancer patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04465-5.",1
"ABSTRACTMillions of people worldwide suffer from cancer, facing challenges such as treatments affecting healthy cells, suboptimal responses, adverse effects, recurrence risk, drug resistance, and nonspecific targeting. Chemoresistance leads to fatalities, but phytoactives show promise in cancer management despite limitations such as high metabolism, poor absorption, and high dosage requirements. Challenges in the large-scale isolation of phytoactive compounds, solubility, bioavailability, and targeting limit their development. Recent developments, including carbohydrate, lipid, and protein-based nanoparticles, have enhanced cancer treatment by improving the bioavailability and targeted delivery of phytoactives such as polyphenols, alkaloids, sulfur-containing compounds, flavonoids, and terpenes. Despite advancements, clinical application faces hurdles such as poor bioavailability and inconsistent immune responses. This article discusses the promise of phytoactive-loaded nanoformulations in cancer management, highlighting targeted drug delivery, unmet needs, and challenges. Further research is needed to overcome these challenges and fully understand the potential of phytoactives in cancer management.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematologic malignancy. Chemotherapy resistance results in a dismal survival rate of 1–2 years in older adults with AML. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently required. In this context, microRNA (miRNA)-based treatments remain an untapped strategy in AML. Using patient-derived specimens, we found increased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of older adults with AML, and decreased miR-497-5p in CD34+ leukemic blasts. Target prediction revealed that miR-497-5p could directly target mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAP2K1) mRNA to indirectly target cytokines and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway through the p38-MAPK signaling pathway, potentially inhibiting leukemic growth and overcoming chemoresistance from venetoclax. To improve miRNA delivery and minimize off-target effects, which represent key barriers to clinical translation, we developed liposomes for co-delivery of miR-497-5p and venetoclax. We decorated our liposomes with a peptide targeting CLL1, which is present on 92% of leukemia blasts while being absent in normal hematopoietic cells. This targeted approach demonstrated high efficacy in inhibiting AML growth in mice with minimal toxicity, as well as reduced exposure to chemoresistance. Our findings suggested that anti-CLL1-decorated, miR-497-5p, and venetoclax-loaded liposomes represent a promising novel miRNA-based therapeutic, which should be investigated further as a strategy to reduce venetoclax resistance in AML.",1
"AbstractNecroptosis, a cell death mechanism with the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. Induction of necroptosis for cancer therapy may be possible through the regulation of the expression of a key factor gene receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3 (RIPK3) via in vitro transcription (IVT) mRNA delivery. However, mRNA is susceptible to degradation and has a low delivery efficiency, which highlights the requirement of a proper delivery vehicle for intracellular delivery. Therefore, a new mRNA delivery system based on the nanostructured silica nanoparticles, termed mRNA‐protective nanocage (mPN) has been developed. High‐efficiency expression of RIPK3 and induction of necroptosis is achieved through delivery of RIPK3 IVT mRNA with mPN in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, the mPN carrying RIPK3 mRNA distributed locally in tumors upon intravascular injection, and successfully induced necroptosis and immune cell infiltration, a hallmark of necroptosis. the suppression of tumor growth in a murine cancer model, demonstrating the synergistic effect of RIPK3 mRNA‐ and immune cell‐mediated therapy is also observed. These findings suggest the potential for anticancer therapy through necroptosis induction and provide a strategy for the development of mRNA‐based nanomedicine.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematologic malignancy.

Using patient-derived specimens, we found increased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of older adults with AML, and decreased miR-497-5p in CD34+ leukemic blasts. Target prediction revealed that miR-497-5p could directly target mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAP2K1) mRNA to indirectly target cytokines and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway through the p38-MAPK signaling pathway, potentially inhibiting leukemic growth and overcoming chemoresistance from venetoclax. To improve miRNA delivery and minimize off-target effects, which represent key barriers to clinical translation, we developed liposomes for co-delivery of miR-497-5p and venetoclax. We decorated our liposomes with a peptide targeting CLL1, which is present on 92% of leukemia blasts while being absent in normal hematopoietic cells. This targeted approach demonstrated high efficacy in inhibiting AML growth in mice with minimal toxicity, as well as reduced exposure to chemoresistance. Our findings suggested that anti-CLL1-decorated, miR-497-5p, and venetoclax-loaded liposomes represent a promising novel miRNA-based therapeutic, which should be investigated further as a strategy to reduce venetoclax resistance in AML.",0
"ABSTRACTCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a powerful measure of minimal residual disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although immunotherapy has been widely established in metastatic CRC that is mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H), its role in non-metastatic CRC is rapidly evolving. In resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage II CRC, adjuvant fluoropyrimidine has no benefit and is not recommended. There is growing evidence to suggest diminished benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation in localized CRC that is dMMR/MSI-H. We present two cases of dMMR/MSI-H stage III CRC treated with definitive surgery wherein adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy led to a failure to clear postoperative plasma ctDNA levels, prompting a change to immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab and resultant ctDNA clearance. We illustrate that chemotherapy may achieve suboptimal disease control in localized colon cancer that is dMMR/MSI-H, while plasma ctDNA offers a window of opportunity to gauge the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy to clear microscopic disease in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer. These findings are important to contextualize given that relapse is inevitable with failure to clear MRD in the postoperative stage I-III CRC setting whereby chemotherapy remains the standard adjuvant therapy in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer.","BackgroundPatients with glioma have limited treatment options and experience poor prognoses. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the relevance of WSC domain-containing 2 (WSCD2) expression to glioma, clinicopathological characteristics, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TILs), and patient prognosis.MethodsWe analyzed WSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues and patient survival using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. Furthermore, the relationship between the expressions of WSCD2 mRNA and TILs in gliomas was evaluated utilizing the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Lastly, we employed multiplex immunohistochemistry to detect the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues.ResultsWSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues was lower than that in tissues of benign brain disease. High WSCD2 mRNA expression was also significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, WSCD2 mRNA expression was correlated with TIL expression in glioma; however, no such relationship was detected between the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues. Cox regression multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that WSCD2 expression in glioma tissues could be an independent prognostic factor.ConclusionThis study highlights the correlation between WSCD2 expression and TILs and demonstrates the prognostic significance of WSCD2 in glioma. Furthermore, our results suggest that WSCD2 may be a potential immunotherapy target in glioma.",1
"ObjectiveTo search for human protein-coding genes related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and perform prognosis risk assessment.MethodsGenes related to HBV-HCC were selected through literature screening and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network database analysis. Prognosis potential genes (PPGs) were identified using Cox regression analysis. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on PPGs, and risk scores were calculated. Kaplan–Meier plots were used to analyze overall survival rates, and the results were predicted based on clinicopathological variables. Association analysis was also conducted with immune infiltration, immune therapy, and drug sensitivity. Experimental verification of the expression of PPGs was done in patient liver cancer tissue and normal liver tissue adjacent to tumors.ResultsThe use of a prognosis potential genes risk assessment model can reliably predict the prognosis risk of patients, demonstrating strong predictive ability. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the overall survival rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than that of the high-risk group. There were significant differences between the two subgroups in terms of immune infiltration and IC50 association analysis. Experimental verification revealed that CYP2C19, FLNC, and HNRNPC were highly expressed in liver cancer tissue, while UBE3A was expressed at a lower level.ConclusionPPGs can be used to predict the prognosis risk of HBV-HCC patients and play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. They also reveal their potential role in the tumor immune microenvironment, clinical-pathological characteristics, and prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04989-4.","Although major progress has been made in the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for hematological malignancies, this method is ineffective against solid tumors largely because of the limited infiltration, activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells. To overcome this issue, we engineered CAR-T cells with synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors, which induce local tumor-specific secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading enzymes at the tumor site. SynNotch CAR-T cells achieve precise ECM recognition and robustly kill targeted tumors, with synNotch-induced enzyme production enabling the degradation of components of the tumor ECM. In addition, this regulation strongly increased the infiltration of CAR-T cells and the clearance of solid tumors, resulting in tumor regression without toxicity in vivo. Notably, synNotch CAR-T cells also promoted the persistent activation of CAR-T cells in patient-derived tumor organoids. Thus, we constructed a synthetic T-cell system that increases the infiltration and antitumor function of CAR-T cells, providing a strategy for targeting ECM-rich solid tumors.",0
