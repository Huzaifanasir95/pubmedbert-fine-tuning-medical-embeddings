"AbstractPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) manifests diverse molecular subtypes, including the classical/progenitor and basal-like/squamous subtypes, with the latter known for its aggressiveness. We employed integrative transcriptome and metabolome analyses to identify potential genes contributing to the molecular subtype differentiation and its metabolic features. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that adrenoceptor alpha 2A (ADRA2A) was downregulated in the basal-like/squamous subtype, suggesting its potential role as a candidate suppressor of this subtype. Reduced ADRA2A expression was significantly associated with a high frequency of lymph node metastasis, higher pathological grade, advanced disease stage, and decreased survival among PDAC patients. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ADRA2A transgene expression and ADRA2A agonist inhibited PDAC cell invasion. Additionally, ADRA2A-high condition downregulated the basal-like/squamous gene expression signature, while upregulating the classical/progenitor gene expression signature in our PDAC patient cohort and PDAC cell lines. Metabolome analysis conducted on the PDAC cohort and cell lines revealed that elevated ADRA2A levels were associated with suppressed amino acid and carnitine/acylcarnitine metabolism, which are characteristic metabolic profiles of the classical/progenitor subtype. Collectively, our findings suggest that heightened ADRA2A expression induces transcriptome and metabolome characteristics indicative of classical/progenitor subtype with decreased disease aggressiveness in PDAC patients. These observations introduce ADRA2A as a candidate for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting in PDAC.","AbstractBACKGROUNDGlioblastoma (GBM), one of the deadliest primary tumors of the central nervous system, is characterized by a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs) are a dominant population of immune cells in the GBM TME and substantially contribute to immunosuppression, tumor progression, and treatment resistance. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying TAM behavior is crucial to the development of effective immuno-therapeutic strategies for treating GBM. The adaptor protein, Caspase Recruitment Domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) is primarily expressed in myeloid cells and its activation triggers assembly of the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which then promotes activation of NF-κB and/or MAPK pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the CBM complex in the GBM TME and assess its potential as a therapeutic target. METHODS/RESULTSIn silico analyses revealed that GBM tumors demonstrate increased CARD9 and MALT1 expression in comparison to non-tumor brain tissue, with CARD9 expressed only within the myeloid compartment. Using co-culture, scratch wound, and transwell assays, we found that GBM tumor cells induce macrophage M2 polarization and migration via a mechanism that is dependent on CARD9/MALT1 signaling within macrophages. scRNA-Seq and flow-cytometric analysis of orthotopic syngeneic immunocompetent GBM tumor models revealed that the GBM TME is dominated by macrophages. Disruption of MALT1 protease activity within the TME leads to reduced tumor infiltration by immunosuppressive TAMs, remodeling of TAMs toward an immunoreactive anti-tumor phenotype, and improved survival of GBM-bearing mice. Additionally, we found that tumor growth was abrogated when GBM-bearing mice were treated with either a MALT1-protease inhibitor or a CARD9 inhibitor. CONCLUSIONSOur study suggests that blockade of the CARD9-MALT1 signaling axis impairs GBM-induced macrophage recruitment and M2 polarization and inhibits tumor progression. These findings nominate the CARD9-MALT1 signaling axis as a new target for TAM-directed immunotherapy for the treatment of GBM.",0
"ABSTRACTMalignant tumors including gastric cancer (GC) are the leading cause of deaths among reproductive women. Physiological morning sickness can mask the clinical manifestations of GC, whereas the clinical presence of metastatic tumors in the abdominal cavity may be easily mistaken for abdominal swelling caused by fetal growth. Pregnancy and delivery processes in young females could accelerate the growth of GC, leading to its rapid development and grave prognosis. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical and gastrointestinal endoscopy is recommended for any suspected pregnant woman with long-term morning sickness. Treatment strategies, including chemotherapy, resection surgery and radiotherapy, will be determined based on a comprehensive consideration of the status of both the fetus and the mother. Rational management, especially clinical multidisciplinary collaboration may significantly benefit such patients.","AbstractStandard of care (SOC) for ndGBM begins with maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and maintenance temozolomide. IGV-001 is an autologous biologic-device combination immunotherapy for the treatment of ndGBM that consists of autologous GBM tumor cells and an antisense oligonucleotide against IGF-1R mRNA, irradiated and administered via biodiffusion chambers implanted in the abdomen. In a phase 1b study, IGV-001 was well tolerated without unexpected adverse events in subjects with ndGBM. Multiple efficacy signals were observed, including significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), radiographic evidence of tumor response, and changes in immune response biomarkers. Here, we present early safety data from the phase 2b randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT04485949) designed to assess efficacy and safety of IGV-001 in subjects with ndGBM across 20 sites in the United States. After surgical resection, subjects were randomized 2:1 and treated with IGV-001 or placebo followed by SOC. The primary outcome is PFS, defined as the time from randomization to first progression, as determined by blinded central radiology review, or death. Secondary outcomes include OS, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause, and safety. As of May 22, 2024, 99 subjects were randomized and 95 implanted with IGV-001 or placebo plus SOC. A total of 39/45 (86.7%) subjects had sufficient follow-up time after initiated treatment with concurrent radiation and temozolomide. Nine of 72 randomized (12.5%) discontinued treatment, including 7 who stopped during the SOC treatment period. None ceased treatment for adverse events, protocol deviations, or death. A total of 11/72 (15.3%) randomized subjects discontinued the study after randomization. A review of blinded safety data did not show any emerging risk and supports no change to the benefit-risk profile of IGV-001 versus placebo. Updated data will be presented.",0
"Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are an important cause of engraftment failure and may negatively impact survival outcomes of patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using an HLA-mismatched allograft. The incidence of DSA varies across studies, depending on individual factors, detection or identification methods and thresholds considered clinically relevant. Although DSA testing by multiplex bead arrays remains semiquantitative, it has been widely adopted as a standard test in most transplant centers. Additional testing to determine risk of allograft rejection may include assays with HLA antigens in natural conformation, such as flow cytometric crossmatch, and/or antibody binding assays, such as C1q testing. Patients with low level of DSA (<2,000 mean fluorescence intensity; MFI) may not require treatment, while others with very high level of DSA (>20,000 MFI) may be at very high-risk for engraftment failure despite current therapies. By contrast, in patients with moderate or high level of DSA, desensitization therapy can successfully mitigate DSA levels and improve donor cell engraftment rate, with comparable outcomes to patients without DSA. Treatment is largely empirical and multimodal, involving the removal, neutralization, and blocking of antibodies, as well as inhibition of antibody production to prevent activation of the complement cascade. Desensitization protocols are based on accumulated multicenter experience, while prospective multicenter studies remain lacking. Most patients require a full intensity protocol that includes plasma exchange, while protocols relying only on rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin may be sufficient for patients with lower DSA levels and negative C1q and/or flow cytometric crossmatch. Monitoring DSA levels before and after HSCT could guide preemptive treatment when high levels persist after stem cell infusion. This paper aims to standardize current evidence-based practice and formulate future directions to improve upon current knowledge and advance treatment for this relatively rare, but potentially serious complication in allogeneic HSCT recipients.","PurposeColon cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the intestine. Abnormal Carboxylesterases 3 (CES3) expression had been reported to be correlated to multiple tumor progression. However, the association among CES3 expression and prognostic value and immune effects in colonic adenocarcinoma (COAD) were unclear.Patients and methodsThe transcription and expression data of CES3 and corresponding clinical information was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The CES3 protein expression and the prognostic value were verified based on tissue microarray data. The Cancer immune group Atlas (TCIA), Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm and the GSE78220 immunotherapy cohort were used to forecast immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, a prognostic immune signature was constructed and verified.ResultsCompared with normal colon tissues, the expression of mRNA and protein levels of CES3 were downregulated in tumor tissues. CES3 expression was associated with TIICs. Hihg-CES3 COAD patients had better efficacy of concurrent immunotherapy. CES3-related immune genes (CRIs) were identified and were then used to construct prognostic immune signature and had been successfully verified in GES39582.ConclusionCES3 might be a potential immune-related gene and promising prognostic biomarker in COAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05156-5.",0
"AbstractTraditional vaccines have played an important role in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, but they still have problems such as low immunogenicity, poor stability, and difficulty in inducing lasting immune responses. In recent years, the nucleic acid vaccine has emerged as a relatively cheap and safe new vaccine. Compared with traditional vaccines, nucleic acid vaccine has some unique advantages, such as easy production and storage, scalability, and consistency between batches. However, the direct administration of naked nucleic acid vaccine is not ideal, and safer and more effective vaccine delivery systems are needed. With the rapid development of nanocarrier technology, the combination of gene therapy and nanodelivery systems has broadened the therapeutic application of molecular biology and the medical application of biological nanomaterials. Nanoparticles can be used as potential drug-delivery vehicles for the treatment of hereditary and infectious diseases. In addition, due to the advantages of lung immunity, such as rapid onset of action, good efficacy, and reduced adverse reactions, pulmonary delivery of nucleic acid vaccine has become a hot spot in the field of research. In recent years, lipid nanocarriers have become safe, efficient, and ideal materials for vaccine delivery due to their unique physical and chemical properties, which can effectively reduce the toxic side effects of drugs and achieve the effect of slow release and controlled release, and there have been a large number of studies using lipid nanocarriers to efficiently deliver target components into the body. Based on the delivery of tuberculosis (TB) nucleic acid vaccine by lipid carrier, this article systematically reviews the advantages and mechanism of liposomes as a nucleic acid vaccine delivery carrier, so as to lay a solid foundation for the faster and more effective development of new anti-TB vaccine delivery systems in the future.","ABSTRACTLung cancer is a leading cause of global cancer mortality, often treated with chemotherapeutic agents. However, conventional approaches such as oral or intravenous administration of drugs yield low bioavailability and adverse effects. Nanotechnology has unlocked new gateways for delivering medicine to their target sites. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) are one of the nano-scaled delivery platforms that have been studied to exploit advantages of liposomes and polymers, enhancing stability, drug loading, biocompatibility and controlled release. Pulmonary administration of drug-loaded LPHNPs enables direct lung deposition, rapid onset of action and heightened efficacy at low doses of drugs. In this manuscript, we will review the potential of LPHNPs in management of lung cancer through pulmonary administration.",1
"SummaryPathologists play a central role in RCC patient care by confirming the diagnosis of malignancy, determining the histologic type of RCC, and assessing many important prognostic factors such as the pathological stage, nuclear grade, presence of sarcomatoid or rhabdoid features, and others. In recent years, our increased understanding of the molecular alterations driving specific RCC types has led to an improved classification scheme that better informs patient prognosis and treatment. In spite of this progress, no predictive biomarkers are currently approved for the management of patients with RCC. Pathologists are uniquely positioned to move the field forward by developing IHC/mIF-based predictors of outcome to ICI-based therapy that could be utilized in the clinic.","Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal and fast-growing cancers with a poor prognosis. Herein, we report the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a new prognostic biomarker in pancreatic cancer progression analysis at the clinical level. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 86 clinically proven cases of pancreatic cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) using anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Histoscore was done, and a variety of cutoffs were identified for analyses of the results. The chi-square test and Kaplan–Meier method were used to find the association between pancreatic cancer and various clinicopathological variables and the overall survival of the patients. PD-L1 expression was associated with histological grade and recurrence of the disease for epithelial and stromal staining at 10 histoscores. In addition, PD-L1 expression was strongly associated with lymph node involvement at the stromal 20 histoscore. The tumor stage of pancreatic cancer had an association with PD-L1 expression with epithelial and stromal 20 histoscores for all comparisons. At a stromal 20 histoscore, overall survival in high-low expression of PD-L1 was 7–19 months, and at a nuclear/cytoplasmic 10 histoscore, it was 9–28 months (p = 0.0001), respectively. Overall, PD-L1 overexpression in subcellular compartments was associated with disease aggression phenotypes and poor patient survival. Overexpression of PD-L1 was directly linked to pancreatic cancer progression and a poor survival rate. Therefore, PD-L1 may be used as a prognostic biomarker in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of pancreatic cancer patients.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown significant efficacy in hematological diseases. However, CAR T therapy has demonstrated limited efficacy in solid tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). One of the most important reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune cells used to eliminate tumor cells. The human transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) plays a crucial role in forming the suppressive GBM TME and driving the suppression of the anti-GBM response. To mitigate TGF-β-mediated suppressive activity, we combined a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor II (dnTGFβRII) with our previous bicistronic CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 construct, currently being evaluated in a clinical trial, to generate CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII, a tri-modular construct we are developing for clinical application. We hypothesized that this approach would more effectively subvert resistance mechanisms observed with GBM. Our data suggest that CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII significantly augments T cell proliferation, enhances functional responses, and improves the fitness of bystander cells, particularly by decreasing the TGF-β concentration in a TGF-β-rich TME. In addition, in vivo studies validate the safety and efficacy of the dnTGFβRII cooperating with CARs in targeting and eradicating GBM in an NSG mouse model.","Real-time monitoring of dynamic biological processes in the body is critical to understanding disease progression and treatment response. This data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy. However, current clinical imaging modalities lack the molecular contrast, resolution, and chronic usability for rapid and accurate response assessments. Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a 2.5×5 mm2 CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue. The sensor operates wirelessly via ultrasound (US) at 5 cm depth in oil, harvesting energy with 221 mW/cm2 incident US power density (31% of FDA limits) and backscattering data at 13 kbps with a bit error rate <10−6. In-situ fluorescence excitation is provided by microlaser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical frontend combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate provides >6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A 36×40-pixel array captures images with <125μm resolution. We demonstrate wireless, dual-color fluorescence imaging of both effector and suppressor immune cells in ex vivo mouse tumor samples with and without immunotherapy. These results show promise for providing rapid insight into therapeutic response and resistance, guiding personalized medicine.",0
"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options. Nanotechnology, particularly the use of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), offers new perspectives for targeted photothermal therapies.ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of nanomediated photothermal therapy (PTT) using GNP functionalized with folate and anti-Cadherin-1 antibodies (Cad-1) in the treatment of HCC in a validated murine model.MethodsA bionanosystem composed of gold nanoparticles conjugated with polyethyleneimine (PEI), folic acid (FA), and Cad-1 was synthesized and characterized. A HCC murine model was induced by administration of diethylnitrosamine and carbon tetrachloride. After tumor confirmation, animals were divided into four groups and treated with different doses of the nanoconstruct, followed by near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation (808 nm). A total of 16 animals were allocated into four experimental groups (n = 4 per group). Histological analysis and serum biochemical assays (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)) were performed.ResultsThe treatment induced focal coagulative necrosis within tumor regions, with minimal impact on surrounding healthy liver tissue. Significant reductions in AST and GGT levels were observed in animals treated with higher doses (p < 0.05), confirming the efficacy and selectivity of the therapy. Immunohistochemistry confirmed E-cadherin overexpression in tumor tissue, suggesting a possible diagnosic potential for the targeting system.ConclusionThe GNPs-PEI-FA-Cad-1 system demonstrated promising results for targeted photothermal therapy in HCC, with selective tumor ablation and limited hepatotoxicity. The validated murine model provides a robust platform for preclinical assessment of similar nanotherapies.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in India. This review explores the epidemiological trends and the landscape of systemic therapy for HCC in the Indian context, acknowledging the recent shift in etiology from viral hepatitis to lifestyle-associated factors.A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, including data from the Global Cancer Observatory and the Indian Council of Medical Research, along with a critical analysis of various clinical trials. The article investigates systemic therapies in-depth, discussing their mechanisms, efficacy, and adaptation to Indian healthcare framework.Progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of ≤0.6 compared to sorafenib, overall survival of ∼16–19 months, and objective response rate of 20–30% are the defining thresholds for systemic therapy clinical trials. Systemic therapy for advanced HCC in India primarily involves the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, and cabozantinib, with sorafenib being the most commonly used drug for a long time. Monoclonal antibodies such as ramucirumab and bevacizumab and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, are expanding treatment horizons. Lenvatinib has emerged as a cost-effective alternative, and the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. Despite these advances, late-stage diagnosis and limited healthcare accessibility pose significant challenges, often relegating patients to palliative care.Addressing HCC in India demands an integrative approach that not only encompasses advancements in systemic therapy but also targets early detection and comprehensive care models. Future strategies should focus on enhancing awareness, screening for high-risk populations, and overcoming infrastructural disparities. Ensuring the judicious use of systemic therapies within the constraints of the Indian healthcare economy is crucial. Ultimately, a nuanced understanding of systemic therapeutic options and their optimal utilization will be pivotal in elevating the standard of HCC care in India.",1
"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is an antibody-drug conjugate approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Several clinicals trials are investigating InO in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy or other anti-ALL targeted therapies in the salvage and frontline settings, notably in older adults who often cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy and tend to have higher-risk disease. InO is also increasingly used to bridge patients to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), in sequence with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, to eliminate measurable residual disease, and to prevent post-HSCT relapse. Veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) is a potential complication of InO treatment, particularly when followed by HSCT. Herein, we review the historical development and current status of InO, strategies for mitigating InO-related VOD/SOS risk, and future directions for InO research and clinical use.","BackgroundTriple-drug cisplatin- and taxane-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for metastatic penile squamous cell cancer (PeSCC), with a moderate response rate of 30% to 38%. Relapse after first-line chemotherapy has a poor prognosis and there is no established second-line treatment. Mitomycin C (MMC) is used as an effective chemotherapy in squamous cell carcinoma of other localities. We therefore used MMC as a single agent for the second-line treatment for patients with advanced PeSCC.MethodsNine patients [median age 63 years (range 31 years–81 years)], who, after inguinal and pelvic lymphadenectomy and progression after first-line chemotherapy, received second-line treatment with 20 mg of MMC administered intravenously and weekly, were included in this study. The median number of cycles of MMC was 6 (range 2–12 cycles) and the median cumulative dose was 120 mg absolute (range 40 mg absolute–240 mg absolute). The patients’ toxicity and treatment responses were evaluated, with the latter evaluated using 18F-FDG-PET/CT.ResultsCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and grades 2 or 3 leukopenia occurred in all patients, as did anemia. In seven patients, the application interval had to be extended due to thrombocytopenia. Stable disease was achieved in two patients, and all others progressed under treatment. Seven patients died of the disease, with most patients dying 6 months after starting MMC therapy. Of the two patients who responded with disease stabilization, one died of progressive disease 14 months after MMC treatment. The other responding patient has been stable for over 1 year and is still receiving treatment, which he tolerates well, and has a good quality of life.ConclusionMMC has only moderate efficacy as a second-line treatment in patients with metastatic PeSCC. With MMC treatment, hematological toxicity is marked.",1
"ABSTRACTEpithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a member of the small hydrophobic membrane protein subfamily. EMP1 is aberrantly expressed in various tumor tissues and governs multiple cellular behaviors (for example, proliferation, differentiation, and migration). The resultant regulation of the cancer pathway is responsible for the metastasis of cancer cells and determines the risk of malignant tumor progression. This review provides an updated overview of EMP1 as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor contingent on the cancer type and summarizes its upstream regulators and downstream target genes. This systematic review summarizes our current understanding of the role of EMP1 in malignant tumor development, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for its potential use as the biomarker and therapeutic target.","Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). This review specifically aims to investigate the role of latent microbial infections-such as those caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Chlamydia pneumoniae, and others-in contributing to myelin and axon damage in MS. Methods: We evaluated recent studies from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases that focus on the relationship between latent microbial infections and MS pathogenesis. Results: In MS, emerging evidence suggests that latent microbial infections play a significant role in triggering and perpetuating the inflammatory processes associated with the disease. The potential mechanisms by which these infections contribute to the pathogenesis of MS, highlighting the interplay between the immune system, microbial agents, and the CNS are evaluated. These include molecular mimicry, where similarities in sequence or structure between viral, bacterial, or self-peptides can activate autoreactive T or B cells through cross activation by pathogen-derived peptides, chronic inflammation triggered by persistent infection, leading to immune-mediated damage, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, allowing microbial agents or immune cells to infiltrate the CNS. Conclusion: This review underscores the critical role of latent microbial infections in MS pathogenesis. By elucidating these mechanisms, we provide new insights that could inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions and preventive strategies for MS.",0
"BackgroundT cells have been proven to play important roles in anti-tumor and tumor microenvironment shaping, while these roles have not been explained in bladder cancer (BLCA).MethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to screen T-cell marker genes. Bulk RNA-sequencing data and clinical information from BLCA patients were downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database to develop a prognosis signature. We analyzed the association of different risk groups with survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and immunotherapy response.ResultsBased on 192 T-cell marker genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis, we constructed a prognostic signature containing 7 genes in the training cohort, which was further validated in the testing cohort and GEO cohort. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 1-, 3-, and 5 years were 0.734, 0.742 and 0.726 in the training cohort, 0.697, 0.671 and 0.670 in the testing cohort, 0.702, 0.665 and 0.629 in the GEO cohort, respectively. In addition, we constructed a nomogram based on clinical factors and the risk score of the signature. The low-risk group exhibited higher immune-related pathways, immune cell infiltration and TMB levels. Importantly, immunophenotype score and immunotherapy cohort (IMvigor210) analyses showed that the low-risk group had better immunotherapy response and prognosis.ConclusionsOur study reveals a novel prognostic signature based on T-cell marker genes, which provides a new target and theoretical support for BLCA patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04881-1.","PurposeIn recent times, multiple molecular subtypes with varying prognoses have been identified in bladder cancer (BLCA). However, the attributes of butyrate metabolism-related (BMR) molecular subtypes and their correlation with immunotherapy response remain inadequately explored in BLCA.MethodsWe utilized 594 samples of BLCA to investigate the molecular subtypes mediated by BMR genes and their correlation with the immunotherapy response. To quantify the BMR features of individual tumors, we developed a BMR score through the COX and LASSO regression methods. Clinical-related, tumor microenvironment, drug-sensitive and immunotherapy analyses were used to comprehensively analyze BMR scores.ResultsTwo distinct molecular subtypes related to butyrate metabolism were identified in BLCA, each with unique prognostic implications and immune microenvironments. BMR score was constructed based on 7 BMR genes and was used to classify the patients into two score groups. Clinical analysis revealed that the BMR score was an independent prognostic factor. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. The BMR score can also predict tumor immunity. The results demonstrated that a low BMR score was associated with higher efficacy of immunotherapy, which was also validated by an external dataset.ConclusionOur study proposes both molecular subtypes and a BMR-based score as promising prognostic classifications in BLCA. These findings may offer new insights for the development of precise targeted cancer therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05067-5.",1
"Background:There is a growing literature base regarding menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination among premenopausal people. However, relatively little is known about uterine bleeding in postmenopausal people following COVID-19 vaccination.Objectives:To examine trends in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses over time before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction and describe cases of new-onset postmenopausal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design:All analyses focused on members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest ages 45 and older who were diagnosed with incident postmenopausal bleeding in the electronic medical record. Members with pre-existing postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding, or who were at increased risk of bleeding due to other health conditions, were excluded. We used segmented regression analysis to estimate changes in the incidence of postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses from 2018 through 2021 in Kaiser Permanente Northwest members meeting inclusion criteria, stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status in 2021. Additionally, we identified all members with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccination between December 14, 2020, through August 14, 2021, who had an incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnosis within 60 days of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination, diagnostic procedures, and presumed bleeding etiology were assessed through chart review and described. A temporal scan statistic was run on all cases without clear bleeding etiology.Results:In a population of approximately 80,000 individuals per month there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction (p=0.59). Among 48,438 vaccinated individuals, 104 had postmenopausal bleeding first diagnosed within 60 days following COVID-19 vaccination; 76% of cases (79/104) were confirmed as post-vaccination postmenopausal bleeding after chart review. Median time from vaccination to bleeding onset was 21 days (range: 2–54 days). Among the 56 postmenopausal bleeding cases with a provider-attributed etiology, the common causes of bleeding were uterine or cervical lesions (50% [28/56]), hormone replacement therapy (13% [7/56]), and proliferative endometrium (13% [7/56]). Among the 23 cases without a clear etiology, there was no statistically significant clustering of postmenopausal bleeding onset following vaccination.Conclusions:Within this integrated health system, introduction of COVID-19 vaccines was not associated with an increase in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses. Diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding in the 60 days following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination was rare.","Background.There is evidence suggesting that COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with small, transitory effects on uterine bleeding, possibly including menstrual timing, flow, and duration, in some individuals. However, changes in health care seeking, diagnosis, and workup for abnormal uterine bleeding in the COVID-19 vaccine era are less clear.Objectives.To assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation in a large integrated health system.Study Design.Using segmented regression, we assessed whether the availability of COVID-19 vaccines was associated with changes in monthly, population-based rates of incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses compared to the pre-pandemic period in health system members ages 16–44 years who were not menopausal. We also compared clinical and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with incident abnormal uterine bleeding between December 2020 through October 13, 2021 by vaccination status (never vaccinated, vaccinated in the 60 days prior to diagnosis, vaccinated more than 60 days prior to diagnosis) and conducted detailed chart review of patients diagnosed with abnormal uterine bleeding within 1–60 days of COVID-19 vaccination in the same time period.Results.In monthly populations ranging from 79,000 to 85,000 female health system members, incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis per 100,000 person-days ranged from 8.97 to 19.19. There was no significant change in the level or trend in the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses between the pre-pandemic (January 2019-January 2020) and post-COVID-19 vaccine (December 2020-December 2021) periods. A comparison of clinical characteristics of 2,717 abnormal uterine bleeding cases by vaccination status suggested that abnormal bleeding among recently vaccinated patients was similar or less severe than abnormal bleeding among patients who had never been vaccinated patients or those vaccinated more than 60 days prior. There were also significant differences in age and race of patients with incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses by vaccination status: never vaccinated patients were the youngest and those vaccinated more than 60 days prior were the oldest; the proportion of patients who were Black/African American was highest among never vaccinated patients, and the proportion of Asian patients was higher among vaccinated patients. Chart review of 114 confirmed post-vaccination abnormal uterine bleeding cases diagnosed from December 2020 through October 13, 2021 found that the most common symptoms reported were changes in timing, duration, and volume of bleeding. Approximately one-third of cases received no diagnostic workup; 57% had no etiology for the bleeding documented in the electronic health record. In 12% of cases, the patient mentioned or asked about a possible link between their bleeding and their recent COVID-19 vaccine.Conclusions.The availability of COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with a change in incidence of medically attended abnormal uterine bleeding in our population of over 79,000 female patients of reproductive age. Additionally, among 2,717 patients with abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses in the period following COVID-19 vaccine availability, receipt of the vaccine was not associated with greater bleeding severity.",1
"BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promising results in treating blood cancers, but it has limited efficacy against solid tumors that express mesothelin (MSLN). One of the reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which consists of physical barriers, multiple mechanisms of immune evasion, and various biochemical factors that favor tumor growth and survival. These factors reduce the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells in clinical trials. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to enhance the effectiveness of MSLN-targeted CAR T cell therapy.MethodsTo investigate whether the antitumor efficacy of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells depends on the epitopes they recognize, we generated MSLN-targeted CAR T cells that bind to different regions of MSLN (Region I, II, III and Full length). We then evaluated the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan or an anti-PD-1 antibody in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe found that MSLN-targeted CAR T cells effectively killed MSLN-positive cancer cells (H9, H226 and Panc-1), but not MSLN-negative cells (A431) in vitro. In a mouse model of H9 tumor xenografts, all CAR T cells showed similar tumor suppression, but an MSLN-targeted scFv with Region I epitope, R47, performed slightly better. Combining irinotecan with CAR_R47 T cells enhanced tumor control synergistically in both H9 xenograft mice and patient-derived xenograft mice.ConclusionsOur results suggest that irinotecan can enhance the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells, and offer a promising combination therapy strategy for MSLN-positive solid tumors.","Key Points•CD38-CAR NK and T cells showed enhanced killing toward CD38-expressing hematologic malignancies.•ATRA upregulates CD38, enhancing the activity of CD38-CAR NK cells against resistant CD38-low tumor cells.",0
"AbstractApigenin, a potent natural flavonoid, has emerged as a key therapeutic agent due to its multifaceted medicinal properties in combating various diseases. However, apigenin's clinical utility is greatly limited by its poor water solubility, low bioavailability and stability issues. To address these challenges, this review paper explores the innovative field of nanotechnology-based delivery systems, which have shown significant promise in improving the delivery and effectiveness of apigenin. This paper also explores the synergistic potential of co-delivering apigenin with conventional therapeutic agents. Despite the advantageous properties of these nanoformulations, critical challenges such as scalable production, regulatory approvals and comprehensive long-term safety assessments remain key hurdles in their clinical adoption which must be addressed for commercialization of apigenin-based formulations.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies with a dismal survival rate. Few strategies can effectively prevent the occurrence of HCC. Although immunotherapy has significantly improved HCC-related survival in recent years, this systemic therapy is very expensive and lays a heavy burden on most HCC patients. Aspirin, which is currently one of the most widely used medications in analgesic and cardiovascular diseases, is reported to have anti-tumor effects on HCC. Most importantly, long-term administration of low-dose aspirin does not significantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Owing to its cost-effectiveness and wide use, aspirin can be easily applied as an HCC treatment and is affordable for a wide range of patients. Therefore, deeper understanding and more attention are needed to extend the frontline of aspirin's preventive and therapeutic potential into cancer research and management. In this review, we discuss the preventive effect of aspirin on HCC in the context of different etiological factors, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcohol-associated liver disease. The therapeutic role of aspirin in resectable or unresectable HCC management is also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of aspirin on HCC are fully reviewed and discussed in the following two aspects: the effect of aspirin on multi-oncogenic signaling pathways in HCC (for example, AMPK, Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB) and aspirin-mediated immunometabolic responses in liver diseases. These findings indicate aspirin is a promising agent for populations at risk and HCC patients to prevent or treat HCC.",0
"ABSTRACTThe crosstalk between the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumour cells promote immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy in gastrointestinal (GI) tumours. Post-transcriptional regulation of genes is pivotal to GI tumours progression, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) serve as key regulators via their RNA-binding domains. RBPs may exhibit either anti-tumour or pro-tumour functions by influencing the TIME through the modulation of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs expression, as well as post-transcriptional modifications, primarily N6-methyladenosine (m6A). Aberrant regulation of RBPs, such as HuR and YBX1, typically enhances tumour immune escape and impacts prognosis of GI tumour patients. Further, while targeting RBPs offers a promising strategy for improving immunotherapy in GI cancers, the mechanisms by which RBPs regulate the TIME in these tumours remain poorly understood, and the therapeutic application is still in its early stages. This review summarizes current advances in exploring the roles of RBPs in regulating genes expression and their effect on the TIME of GI tumours, then providing theoretical insights for RBP-targeted cancer therapies.","BackgroundAn increasing number of studies indicated that metabolic reprogramming of amino acid metabolism may either promote or inhibit tumor progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of a gene risk signature associated with amino acid metabolism to predict the prognosis and immune characteristics of invasive breast carcinoma.MethodsLASSO Cox regression analysis was performed to construct and validate the prognostic risk signature based on the expression of 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes. The predictive value of the signature, immune characteristics, and chemotherapeutic drugs was also predicted. Finally, 9 significant genes were examined in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, and the predicted chemotherapeutic drugs were also verified.ResultsThe prognosis of the low-risk group was better than that of the high-risk group. The areas under the curve (AUCs) at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.852, 0.790, and 0.736, respectively. In addition, the GSEA results for KEGG and GO revealed that samples with a high-risk score exhibited a variety of highly malignant manifestations. The high-risk group was characterized by an increased number of M2 macrophages, a high level of tumor purity, low levels of APC co-stimulation, cytolytic activity, HLA, para-inflammation, and type I IFN response. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed that MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells express 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes differently. In addition, cell experiments were conducted to examine the effect of cephaeline-induced on cell viability, migration ability, and protein expression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and HIF-1α.ConclusionWe established a risk signature based on 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes for invasive breast carcinoma. Further analyses revealed that this risk signature is superior to other clinical indexes in survival prediction and that the subgroups identified by the risk signature exhibit distinct immune characteristics. Cephaeline was determined to be a superior option for patients in high-risk groups.",0
"BackgroundChemokines play a vital role in tumor progression, metastasis and prognosis; however, the profile and clinical significance of gamma interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and its receptor (CXCR3) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well evaluated.MethodsLiquid-phase chip technology was used to detect the serum IP-10 in 85 patients with HBV-related HCC, 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 50 liver cirrhosis subjects (CS); simultaneously, the CXCR3 and Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) were determined. Additionally, their mRNA or protein expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), liver tumor and paracancerous tissues were quantified using qRT-PCR or ELISA. Moreover, the IP-10 and CXCR3 expression was verified by the online data from Gene Expression Omnibus. Furthermore, the relationships of serum IP-10, CXCR3 and AFP levels with their overall survival rate were also analyzed.ResultsThe levels of IP-10 and CXCR3 in HCC group were significantly higher than those in CHB and CS groups, and their mRNA of PBMC is significantly positive correlation with those in their liver tissues or HBV DNA load (P < 0.0001), respectively. The serum IP-10 and CXCR3 in HCC were significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, metastases staging and distant metastasis (P < 0.05), but not related to gender, age and tumor size (P > 0.05, except IP-10 based on age).ConclusionsThe serum IP-10 (142.6 pg/mL) and CXCR3 (241.2 pg/mL) could be differential diagnostic surrogates that distinguish HCC from CS, and the lower IP-10 level may be conducive to the postoperative survival of HCC patients. Moreover, the IP-10 and CXCR3 would be related to anti-tumor immunity in HCC patients and be a potential target for treatment of HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05265-1.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal human malignancy with a very low overall and long-term survival rate. Poor prognostic outcomes are predominantly associated with HCC due to a huge landscape of heterogeneity found in the deadliest disease. However, molecular subtyping of HCC has significantly improved the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that contribute towards the heterogeneity and progression of the disease. In this review, we have extensively summarized the current information available about molecular classification of HCC. This review can be of great significance for providing the insight information needed for development of novel, efficient and personalized therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC patients globally.",1
"PurposeEpidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR–TKIs) are the first-line therapy for patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) harboring activating EGFR mutations. However, the emergence of drug resistance to EGFR–TKIs remains a critical obstacle for successful treatment and is associated with poor patient outcomes. The overarching objective of this study is to apply bioinformatics tools to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying resistance to EGFR–TKIs and develop a robust predictive model.MethodsThe genes associated with gefitinib resistance in the LUAD cell Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were identified using gene chip expression data. Functional enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration analysis were performed to comprehensively explore the mechanism of gefitinib resistance. Furthermore, a GRRG_score was constructed by integrating genes related to LUAD prognosis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database with the screened Gefitinib Resistant Related differentially expressed genes (GRRDEGs) using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) features and their association with immune infiltration between different GRRG_score groups. A prognostic model for LUAD was developed based on the GRRG_score and validated. The HPA database was used to validate protein expression. The CTR-DB database was utilized to validate the results of drug therapy prediction based on the relevant genes.ResultsA total of 110 differentially expression genes were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in Mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, Sphingolipid metabolism. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that biological processes strongly correlated with gefitinib resistance were cell proliferation and immune-related pathways, EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION, APICAL_SURFACE, and APICAL_JUNCTION were highly expressed in the drug-resistant group; KRAS_SIGNALING_DN, HYPOXIA, and HEDGEHOG_SIGNALING were highly expressed in the drug-resistant group. The GRRG_score was constructed based on the expression levels of 13 genes, including HSPA2, ATP8B3, SPOCK1, EIF6, NUP62CL, BCAR3, PCSK9, NT5E, FLNC, KRT8, FSCN1, ANGPTL4, and ID1. We further screened and validated two key genes, namely, NUP62CL and KRT8, which exhibited predictive value for both prognosis and drug resistance.ConclusionsOur study identified several novel GRRDEGs and provided insight into the underlying mechanisms of gefitinib resistance in LUAD. Our results have implications for developing more effective treatment strategies and prognostic models for LUAD patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05129-8.","PurposeThe primary objective of this study was to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks and evaluate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and key biomarkers within the ceRNA networks in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients.MethodsComprehensive bioinformatics tools were used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs (DEMs), and lncRNAs (DELs) related to COAD, leading to the creation of ceRNA networks. The CIBERSORT technique was employed to assess the significance of TIICs in COAD, and an immune-related prognosis prediction model was subsequently developed. Co-expression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between key genes in ceRNA networks and immunologically significant TIICs. The study also utilized 5 GEO datasets and web-based databases to externally validate the findings.ResultsThe study revealed a statistically significant relationship between key hub genes and immune cells, as determined through co-expression analysis. Two hub regulators (SOX12 and H19) demonstrated significant prognostic value in the ceRNA-related prognostic model, and their elevated expression levels were verified across multiple CRC cell lines. Additionally, the knockdown of SOX12 led to a suppression of proliferation, migration, and invasion in colon cancer cells.ConclusionThrough the construction of ceRNA networks and evaluation of TIICs, the study successfully established two risk score models and nomograms. These models serve as valuable tools for understanding the molecular processes and predicting the prognosis of COAD patients. Further validation of hub regulators SOX12 and H19 substantiates their potential role as key biomarkers in COAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05316-7.",1
"PurposeRadiotherapy is an integral treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, radiation-induced toxicities such as radiation pneumonitis (RP) present a considerable challenge. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the potential of salivary metabolomics as an independent risk factor for predicting RP.MethodsThis study included 62 consecutive patients with NSCLC who underwent thoracic radiotherapy at Tokyo Medical University between September 2016 and December 2018. The median age of the patients was 75 years (range: 41–89), comprising 47 (75.8%) males and 15 (24.2%) females. Patients with stage I NSCLC received 75 Gy in 30 fractions, whereas those with stage II and III NSCLC received 66 Gy in 33 fractions. Saliva samples were collected before treatment and at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after initiating radiotherapy. Clinical RP was defined as grade 2 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events. Salivary metabolomics were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Salivary metabolites were evaluated as potential predictors of RP.ResultsClinical RP was observed in 11 patients (17.7%); no RP-related deaths were observed. Clinical RP developed at a median of 4 months (range: 2–6 months) after initiating radiotherapy. Three metabolites, butyrate, propionate, and hexanoate, collected before radiotherapy exhibited predictive ability for clinical RP. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated butyrate (P = 0.033) as a predictive factor, along with the previously known factor of lung volume irradiated with > 20 Gy (P = 0.045).ConclusionSalivary metabolite butyrate was an independent risk factor for clinical RP.","Aim: To evaluate the anti-pancreatic cancer effect of novel Tubeimoside I multifunctional liposomes combined with gemcitabine.Methods: Liposomes were prepared through the thin film hydration method, with evaluations conducted on parameters including encapsulation efficiency (EE%), particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), storage stability, and release over a 7-day period.

"The intricate expression patterns and oncogenic attributes of COL11A1 across different cancer types remain largely elusive. This study used several public databases (TCGA, GTEx, and CCLE) to investigate the pan-cancer landscape of COL11A1 expression, its prognostic implications, interplay with the immune microenvironment, and enriched signaling cascades. Concurrently, western blot analyses were performed to verify COL11A1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines and clinical samples. In addition, COL11A1 knockout cell lines were generated to scrutinize the functional consequences of COL11AI expression on cancer cell behavior by use MTT, colony formation, and scratch wound healing assays. A comprehensive database investigation revealed that COL11A1 was upregulated in a majority of tumor tissues and its expression was highly correlated with a patient’s prognosis. Notably, genetic alterations in COL11A1 predominantly occurred as mutations, while its DNA methylation status inversely mirrored gene expression levels across multiple promoter regions. Our findings suggest that COL11A1 helps to modulate the tumor immune landscape and potentially acts through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway to exert its oncogenic function. Western blot analyses further substantiated the specific upregulation of COL11A1 in LUAD cell lines and tissues, suggesting a close association with the EMT process. Ablation of COL11A1 in cancer cells significantly reduced their proliferative, clonogenic, and migratory abilities, underscoring the functional significance of COL11A1 in tumor cell behavior. Collectively, this research revealed the prevalent overexpression of COL11A1 in pan-cancer tissues, its profound prognostic and microenvironmental correlations, and the mechanistic underpinnings of its tumor-promoting effects as mediated via EMT signaling. Our findings suggest that COL11A1 could serve as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer.","Graphical abstractThe schematic representation of circRNA biogenesis, functional mechanisms, and clinical applications in gastric cancer.

"PurposeWe aimed to establish the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) in the East Asian population.MethodsOverall survival (OS) and intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to determine prognostic factors associated with intracranial PFS and OS.ResultsBetween July 2007 and December 2019, 431 patients diagnosed with MBM were enrolled. Mucosal subtype (p = 0.013), LDH level (p = 0.014), the number of MBM ≥ 4 (p = 0.02), local treatment (p < 0.0001) and the use of PD-1 inhibitors (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for intracranial PFS. Mucosal subtype (p = 0.022), LDH level (p = 0.005), no extracranial metastasis (p = 0.01), concurrent liver metastasis (p = 0.004), local treatment (p = 0.001) and the use of PD-1 inhibitors (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for OS. Mucosal subtype brain metastases had a poor response to PD-1 inhibitors (p = 0.007), with a shorter intracranial PFS than other subtypes. In BRAF mutation patients with MBM, the first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy group had an advantage in OS compared to the first-line anti-PD-1 therapy group (p = 0.043).ConclusionOur findings depict clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of MBM in the East Asian population, suggesting the mucosal subtype as an adverse prognostic and predictive factor for patients with MBM. For BRAF mutation patients with MBM, first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy may bring a potential survival benefit compared to first-line anti-PD-1 therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03563-0.","PurposeHuman epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) alterations are found in approximately 2%–5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with NSCLC having HER2 alterations in China and the differences compared with Western counterparts and also perform a prognostic analysis.Material and MethodsA total of 1300 patients diagnosed with NSCLC from January 2017 to December 2020 were included. Their clinical characteristics were retrospectively recorded. The gene expression profiles and clinical information of 20 patients having altered HER2 were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas database and compared, and the prognostic factors affecting the Chinese population were analyzed. If tissues were sufficient, the overexpression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining.ResultsAmong 39 (3.0%) patients with HER2 alterations, 31 patients (79.5%) had HER2 mutations. HER2 insertion mutation in exon 20 was the most common type (A775_G776 ins YVMA). Seven patients (17.9%) had amplification, and one had both. The HER2 kinase domain was most commonly mutated. A majority of patients in the study were young-aged with no smoking history; 66.7% had stage III/IV adenocarcinoma. Compared with Chinese patients, HER2 alterations in Western counterparts were mostly associated with old age, previous smoking, and stages I and II at diagnosis. The most common type of HER2 alteration was HER2 amplification; one patient had coexistence of HER2 gene amplification and fusion. The furin-like cysteine-rich region was most commonly mutated. The median overall survival (OS) of the Chinese patients was 41 months. The univariate analysis showed that age > 60 years, no surgical treatment, no liver or renal cysts on imaging, and maximum tumor diameter ≥ 4.25 cm were significantly associated with poor OS. The multivariate analysis showed that age, presence of surgery, and no hepatic or renal cysts were independent prognostic factors for OS. Chemotherapy achieved better outcomes, and HER2 mutations were not associated with HER2 amplification and overexpression.ConclusionsThis study was novel in comprehensively investigating the clinical and molecular characteristics of patients in Chinese and Western populations, and in analyzing the factors affecting the prognosis of Chinese patients. It provided critical data for future therapies against HER2-altered NSCLC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04196-7.",1
"ObjectivesThe presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI) and extranodal extension (ENE) have shown adverse outcomes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study evaluated the impact of LVI, PNI and ENE, individually and in combination, on survival outcomes in OSCC.Material and MethodsA retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained oral cancer database was done from January 2017 to March 2023. All consecutive OSCC patients who underwent curative intent surgery were included. The triple-positive group was defined by the presence of all three features (LVI/PNI/ENE), while the double-positive group had the presence of two features. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) analysis was done between different study groups.ResultsA total of 255 patients were included in the analysis. The LVI, PNI and ENE positivity was 13%, 26% and 11%, respectively. There were 19 patients (7%) with double-positive and ten patients (4%) with triple-positive disease. The triple-positive group had lower DFS than non-triple-positive (0% vs 57%, p-value 0.001) and lower OS (0% vs 72%, p-value 0.003). The median DFS and OS of the triple-positive group were eight months and 24 months, respectively. Similarly, the double-positive group also had statistically significant inferior DFS (p-value 0.007) and OS (p-value 0.002) compared to the single-positive/triple-negative group.ConclusionThe triple-positive disease had poor outcomes, with no patients achieving disease-free or overall survival at the 5-year follow-up. The presence of multiple adverse factors necessitates modification of adjuvant therapy and therapeutic strategy, which may enhance survival outcomes.","Oral cancer accounts for around 30 percent of all cancers in India. These cancers are usually managed either by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these modalities. Dental oncologists play an integral part in the multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists, nurses, physician assistants, nutritionists, psychologists and social workers to efficiently manage cancer patients. Oral complications associated with cancer therapy can range from minor mucositis or infections to severely debilitating conditions such as osteonecrosis of jaws, which can disrupt the ongoing cancer therapy and jeopardize the overall quality of life of the patient. This highlights the primary role of a dentist in the efficient identification and management of potential oral foci of infection and subsequent prevention of the onset of these complications. This necessitates accurate, evidence-based knowledge and extensive training of dental oncologists to provide state-of-the-art management strategies. This article aims to review oral management before, during and after therapy in patients undergoing treatment for cancers affecting the head and neck region.",1
"Purpose of ReviewAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal blood neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in mitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by novel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluation.Recent FindingsMetabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity to therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial metabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a breakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial complexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting these vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy in preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results limited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on drug combinations with synergistic or additive activity.SummaryIn this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies targeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the specific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to achieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that currently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or are not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells. Thus, further studies of complex metabolic rewiring of leukemia cells before and after combinatorial therapies are warranted.","Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) (∼50–150 nm) that have emerged as promising vehicles for therapeutic applications and drug delivery. These membrane-bound particles, released by all actively dividing cells, have the ability to transfer effector molecules, including proteins, RNA, and even DNA, from donor cells to recipient cells, thereby modulating cellular responses. RNA-based therapeutics, including microRNAs, messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, hold great potential in controlling gene expression and treating a spectrum of medical conditions. RNAs encapsulated in EVs are protected from extracellular degradation, making them attractive for therapeutic applications. Understanding the intricate biology of cargo loading and transfer within EVs is pivotal to unlocking their therapeutic potential. This review discusses the biogenesis and classification of EVs, methods for loading RNA into EVs, their advantages as drug carriers over synthetic-lipid-based systems, and the potential applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Notably, EVs show promise in delivering RNA cargo across the blood-brain barrier and targeting tumor cells, offering a safe and effective approach to RNA-based therapy in these contexts.",0
"Synthetic lethality (SL) and synthetic viability (SV) are commonly studied genetic interactions in the targeted therapy approach in cancer. In SL, inhibiting either of the genes does not affect the cancer cell survival, but inhibiting both leads to a lethal phenotype. In SV, inhibiting the vulnerable gene makes the cancer cell sick; inhibiting the partner gene rescues and promotes cell viability. Many low and high-throughput experimental approaches have been employed to identify SLs and SVs, but they are time-consuming and expensive. The computational tools for SL prediction involve statistical and machine-learning approaches. Almost all machine learning tools are binary classifiers and involve only identifying SL pairs. Most importantly, there are limited properties known that best describe and discriminate SL from SV. We developed MAGICAL (Multi-class Approach for Genetic Interaction in Cancer via Algorithm Learning), a multi-class random forest based machine learning model for genetic interaction prediction. Network properties of protein derived from physical protein-protein interactions are used as features to classify SL and SV. The model results in an accuracy of ~80% for the training dataset (CGIdb, BioGRID, and SynLethDB) and performs well on DepMap and other experimentally derived reported datasets. Amongst all the network properties, the shortest path, average neighbor2, average betweenness, average triangle, and adhesion have significant discriminatory power. MAGICAL is the first multi-class model to identify discriminatory features of synthetic lethal and viable interactions. MAGICAL can predict SL and SV interactions with better accuracy and precision than any existing binary classifier.","A century ago, Otto Warburg's work sparked the field of cancer metabolism, which has since taken a tortuous path. As evidence accumulated over the decades, consensus views of causes of cancer emerged, whereby genetic and epigenetic oncogenic drivers promoted immune evasion and induced new blood vessels and neoplastic metabolism to support tumor growth. Neoplastic cells abandon social cues of intercellular cooperation, escape tissue confinement, metastasize, and ultimately kill the host. Herein, key milestones in the study of cancer metabolism are chronicled with an emphasis on carbohydrate metabolism. The field began with a cancer cell–autonomous view that has been refined by a richer understanding of solid cancers as growing, immune-suppressive, complex organs comprising different cell types that are nourished by a variety of nutrients and variable amounts of oxygen through abnormal neovasculatures. Based on foundational historical studies, our current understanding of cancer metabolism offers a hopeful outlook for targeting metabolism to enhance cancer therapy.",0
"PurposeThis study examined the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) in tumor cells and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma according to histological subtypes.MethodsWe evaluated PD-L1, PD-L2, and IDO1 expression in tumor cells and CD8-positive TILs in surgically resected specimens from 196 stage 0 or I lung adenocarcinoma patients by immunohistochemical staining. We also examined the relationships between the expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, and IDO1 in tumor cells and the density of CD8-positive TILs and clinical factors. Patients were divided into three groups: A, adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (N = 32); B, lepidic predominant invasive adenocarcinoma (IAD; LPA; N = 66); and C, IAD except for LPA (N = 98).ResultsPD-L1 was expressed only in Group C, but not in Groups A or B. The positive ratio of PD-L2 was significantly higher in Group C (63.3%), and that of IDO1 was also significantly higher in Group C (65.3%). The density of CD8-positive TILs was significantly higher in Group C (45 ± 2.4). There was no significant difference between the positive ratios of PD-L2 and IDO1 and the density of CD8-positive TILs in Group A (50.0%, 21.9%, and 36 ± 4.1, respectively) or Group B (60.6%, 25.8%, and 44 ± 3.0, respectively).ConclusionsNo cases in Groups A and B expressed PD-L1. The expression of immune-related factors, especially PD-L1 and IDO1, was significantly associated with Group C. This is the first report of the detailed examination of PD-L1, PD-L2, IDO1, and CD8 expression in lung adenocarcinoma subtypes with lepidic predominant components. Our results could help identify patients who would benefit from perioperative immunotherapy.","BackgroundNeuroblastoma (NBL) is an extracranial malignant tumor in children deriving from the neural crest in the sympathetic nervous system. Although various immunotherapy interventions have made significant breakthroughs in many adult cancers, the efficacy of these immunotherapies was still limited in NBL. NBL has low immunogenicity which results in a lack of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Moreover, tumor cells can wield many immune evasion strategies both in the TME and systemically to impede lymphocyte infiltration and activation. All these factors hamper the anti-tumor effects of CD8+ T cells during immunotherapy and the levels of infiltrating CD8+ T cells correlate with therapy response. Materials and methodsIn this study, we utilized multidimensional bioinformatic methods to establish a risk model based on CD8+ T cells -related genes (CD8+ TRGs).ResultsWe obtained 33 CD8+ TRGs with well-predictive ability for prognosis in both GSE49711 and E-MTAB-8248 cohorts. Then, 12 CD8+ TRGs including HK2, RP2, HPSE, ELL2, GFI1, SLC22A16, FCGR3A, CTSS, SH2D1A, RBP5, ATF5, and ADAM9 were finally identified for risk model construction and validation. This model revealed a stable performance in prognostic prediction of the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in patients with NBL. Additionally, our research indicated that the immune and stromal scores, immune-related pathways, immune cell infiltration, the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and immune checkpoint molecules, immunotherapy response, and drug susceptibility revealed significant differences between high and low-risk groups. ConclusionsAccording to our analyses, the constructed CD8+ TRGs-based risk model may be promising for the clinical prediction of anti-tumor therapy responses and prognoses in NBL.

"PurposeTumor stem cells have emerged as a crucial focus of investigation and a therapeutic target in the context of cancer metastasis and drug resistance. They represent a promising novel approach to address the treatment of uveal melanoma (UVM).MethodsAccording to the one-class logistic regression (OCLR) approach, we first estimated two stemness indices (mDNAsi and mRNAsi) in a cohort of UVM (n = 80). The prognostic value of stemness indices among four subtypes of UVM (subtype A–D) was investigated. Moreover, univariate Cox regression and Lasso-penalized algorithms were conducted to identify a stemness-associated signature and verify in several independent cohorts. Besides, UVM patients classified into subgroups based on the stemness-associated signature. The differences in clinical outcomes, tumor microenvironment, and probability of immunotherapeutic response were investigated further.ResultsWe observed that mDNAsi was significantly linked with overall survival (OS) time of UVM, but no association was discovered between mRNAsi and OS. Stratification analysis indicated that the prognostic value of mDNAsi was only limited in subtype D of UVM. Besides, we established and verified a prognostic stemness-associated gene signature which can classify UVM patients into subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, tumor mutation, immune microenvironment, and molecular pathways. The high risk of UVM is more sensitive to immunotherapy. Finally, a well-performed nomogram was constructed to predict the mortality of UVM patients.ConclusionsThis study offers a comprehensive examination of UVM stemness characteristics. We discovered mDNAsi-associated signatures improved the prediction capacity of individualized UVM prognosis and indicated prospective targets for stemness-regulated immunotherapy. Analysis of the interaction between stemness and tumor microenvironment may shed light on combinational treatment that targets both stem cell and the tumor microenvironment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05061-x.","ABSTRACTCholesterol serves as a vital lipid that regulates numerous physiological processes. Nonetheless, its role in regulating cell death processes remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of cholesterol trafficking in immunogenic cell death. Through cell-based drug screening, we identified two antidepressants, sertraline and indatraline, as potent inducers of the nuclear translocation of TFEB (transcription factor EB). Activation of TFEB was mediated through the autophagy-independent lipidation of MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3). Both compounds promoted cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes, resulting in lysosomal membrane permeabilization, disruption of autophagy and cell death that could be reversed by cholesterol depletion. Molecular docking analysis indicated that sertraline and indatraline have the potential to inhibit cholesterol binding to the lysosomal cholesterol transporters, NPC1 (NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1) and NPC2. This inhibitory effect might be further enhanced by the upregulation of NPC1 and NPC2 expression by TFEB. Both antidepressants also upregulated PLA2G15 (phospholipase A2 group XV), an enzyme that elevates lysosomal cholesterol. In cancer cells, sertraline and indatraline elicited immunogenic cell death, converting dying cells into prophylactic vaccines that were able to confer protection against tumor growth in mice. In a therapeutic setting, a single dose of each compound was sufficient to significantly reduce the outgrowth of established tumors in a T-cell-dependent manner. These results identify sertraline and indatraline as immunostimulatory agents for cancer treatment. More generally, this research shed light on novel therapeutic avenues harnessing lysosomal cholesterol transport to regulate immunogenic cell death.Abbreviation: ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG13: autophagy related 13; DKO: double knockout; ICD: immunogenic cell death; KO: knockout; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; LGALS3: galectin 3; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; LMP: lysosomal membrane permeabilization; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MTX: mitoxantrone; NPC1: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1; NPC2: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2; TFE3: transcription factor E3; TFEB: transcription factor EB; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.",0
"AbstractMost patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have limited treatment options following standard-of-care therapy. VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05425940 (ClinicalTrials.gov)","Metabolic adaptation serves as a significant driving force for cancer growth and poses a substantial obstacle for cancer therapies. Herein, we unraveled the role of m6A-mediated serine synthesis pathway (SSP) regulation in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrated that treatment of highly specific m6A inhibitor (STM2457) effectively inhibited HCC cell line growth and suppressed spontaneous HCC formation in mice driven by liver-specific Tp53 knockout and Myc overexpression. Using GLORI-seq, we delineated a single-base-resolution m6A landscape in human HCC cell lines. Interestingly, we identified three core enzymes in the SSP (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) as novel targets of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In these SSP genes, m6A modification recruited m6A reader IGF2BP3 to stabilize their mRNA transcripts, thereby enhancing their mRNA and protein expression in HCC cells. Most importantly, our GLORI-seq data revealed that sorafenib-resistant HCC cells elevated m6A modification in SSP genes to promote protein expression and antioxidant production. STM2457 treatment attenuated the serine synthesis pathway, induced oxidative stress, and sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib treatments. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting m6A could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.",0
"The P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated ion channel which belongs to the P2X receptor family, plays critical roles in recognizing extracellular adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) and is widely expressed in most tumor cells as well as inflammatory cells. Previously, the P2X7 receptor has been demonstrated to modulate the progression of various malignancies, including glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. However, the biological function and prognostic values of P2X7 receptor in hepatocellular carcinoma remain to be determined. Here, we investigated the expression level of P2X7 receptor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Then MTS and EdU assays were carried out to study the role of P2X7 receptor blockade in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, the underlying mechanism was further elucidated by bulk RNAseq. Compared to the control group, the P2X7 receptor was significantly up-regulated in the hepatocellular carcinoma group. Interestingly, A740003 and A438079, two selective antagonists at P2X7 receptor, significantly blocked Ca2+ influx and decreased the proliferative rate of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the expression level of chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CHSY1), an enzyme that mediates the polymerization step of chondroitin sulfate, was reduced by both A740003 and A438079. In conclusion, inhibition of the P2X7 receptor attenuated the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and this process was largely modulated by CHSY1. Thus, our findings reveal a previously unknown role for P2X7 receptor in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and imply that the P2X7 receptor may represent a new target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11302-024-10064-5.","The invention in this patent application relates to 1,6-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridin-7-one derivatives represented generally by formula 1.

"SUMMARYExtracellular 2’3’-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is an immunotransmitter exported by diseased cells and imported into host cells to activate the innate immune STING pathway. We previously identified SLC19A1 as a cGAMP importer, but its use across human cell lines is limited. Here, we identify LRRC8A heteromeric channels, better known as volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as widely-expressed cGAMP transporters. LRRC8A forms complexes with LRRC8C and/or LRRC8E, depending on their expression levels, to transport cGAMP and other 2’3’-cyclic dinucleotides. In contrast, LRRC8D inhibits cGAMP transport. We demonstrate that cGAMP is effluxed or influxed via LRRC8 channels, as dictated by the cGAMP electrochemical gradient. Activation of LRRC8A channels, which can occur under diverse stresses, strongly potentiates cGAMP transport. We identify activator sphingosine 1-phosphate and inhibitor DCPIB as chemical tools to manipulate channel-mediated cGAMP transport. Finally, LRRC8A channels are key cGAMP transporters in resting primary human vasculature cells and universal human cGAMP transporters when activated.","AbstractNK-lysins from chicken, bovine and human are used as antiviral and antibacterial agents. Gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium, are susceptible to NK-lysin treatment. The presence of dominant TEM-1 gene was noted in all untreated and treated bacteria, while TOHO-1 gene was absent in all bacteria. Importantly, β-lactamase genes CTX-M-1, CTX-M-8, and CTX-M-9 genes were detected in untreated bacterial strains; however, none of these were found in any bacterial strains following treatment with NK-lysin peptides. NK-lysin peptides are also used to test for inhibition of infectivity, which ranged from 50 to 90% depending on NK-lysin species. Chicken, bo vine and human NK-lysin peptides are demonstrated herein to have antibacterial activity and antiviral activity against Rotavirus (strain SA-11). On the basis of the comparison between these peptides, potent antiviral activity of bovine NK-lysin against Rotavirus (strain SA-11) is particularly evident, inhibiting infection by up to 90%. However, growth was also significantly inhibited by chicken and human NK-lysin peptides, restricted by 80 and 50%, respectively. This study provided a novel treatment using NK-lysin peptides to inhibit expression of β-lactamase genes in β-lactam antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.",0
"The rapid advancement of targeted therapeutics has significantly improved treatment precision and efficacy in oncology and metabolic disorders. This article integrates key developments in four areas: highly selective PPAR modulators for metabolic and inflammatory diseases; CRISPR-engineered T-cell receptor therapies targeting the KRAS G12D mutation in cancer; strategies to enhance antitumor immunity through glutamine metabolism modulation in the tumor microenvironment; and a novel system for analyzing coformulated biologics. These innovations highlight the integration of metabolic modulation, immune system engineering, and advanced biologic formulation, paving the way for more effective and personalized therapeutic approaches.","PurposeUndifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is associated with poor prognosis. Recently, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα), which is the immune checkpoint of macrophages, and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif domains (TIGIT), which is the immune checkpoint of T cells and natural killer cells, have been considered as potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. This study aimed to assess the value of SIRPα and TIGIT as prognostic factors of UPS.Materials and methodsThe cBio Cancer Genomics Portal was used to analyze mRNA expression data of 50 UPS cases in the Cancer Genome Atlas. We retrieved 49 UPS cases and performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), SIRPα, CD68, CD163, TIGIT, CD155, and CD8.ResultsSIRPα was positively associated with CD163 (Pearson’s r = 0.51, p = 0.0002) as per open access data and IHC of the cohort (p = 0.002), which revealed that SIRPα-positive macrophage infiltration was higher in UPS cells with ≥ 1% PD-L1 expression than that in UPS cells with < 1% PD-L1 expression (p = 0.047). TIGIT was positively correlated with PD-L1 (r = 0.54, p < 0.0001) and CD8A (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001). In 35 of 49 cases, IHC revealed high levels of TIGIT expression on tumor cells. Furthermore, TIGIT expression on tumor cells was negatively correlated with CD155-positive (p = 0.0144) and CD8-positive (p = 0.0487) cell infiltration. Survival analysis showed that the high degree of SIRPα-positive macrophage infiltration was associated with poor overall survival and metastasis (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0006, respectively).ConclusionSIRPα-positive macrophages infiltrated UPS cells, which predicted poor prognosis. High TIGIT expression on tumor cells was associated with decreased levels of tumor-infiltrating macrophages in UPS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04078-y.",0
"Introduction of fluorine into bioactive molecules has attracted much attention in drug development. For example, tetrafluorination of the phthalimide moiety of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) has a strong beneficial effect on the ability to inhibit angiogenesis. The neomorphic activity of E3 ligase complexes is induced by the binding of IMiDs to cereblon. We investigated that a set of eight thalidomide analogs, comprising non- and tetrafluorinated counterparts, did not induce the degradation of neomorphic substrates (IKZF3, GSPT1, CK1α, SALL4). Hence, the antiangiogenic activity of fluorinated IMiDs was not triggered by neosubstrate degradation features. A fluorine scanning of non-traditional IMiDs of the benzamido glutarimide chemotype was performed. By measuring the endothelial cell tube formation, no angiogenesis inhibitors were identified, confirming the narrow structure–activity window of IMiD-induced antiangiogenesis.","Tumor recurrence after the clinical cure of tumor often results from the presence of an abnormal microenvironment, including an aberrant vasculature. The tumor microenvironment is rich in pro-angiogenic factors but lacks pro-maturation factors. Pro-angiogenic conditions in the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, are double-edged swords, promoting both the repair of normal tissues and the development of an abnormal blood vessel network. The coexistence of perfusion and hypoxic zones and uneven blood vessel distribution in tumor tissues profoundly influence tumor deterioration, recurrence, and metastasis. Traditional anti-angiogenic therapies have shown limited efficacy, and promote drug resistance, and even metastasis. In contrast, vascular normalization therapy induces a more physiological-like state, leading to better outcomes and fewer side effects. Vascular normalization entails modifying the tumor vascular system to improve tumor oxygenation and substance transport, thereby contributing to improving the efficacy of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. This review mainly focuses on the process of tumor vascularization; potential therapeutic targets, including cells, metabolism, signaling pathways, and angiogenesis-related genes; and possible strategies to normalize blood vessels through regulating tumor vessel generation, the development of tumor vessels, and blood vessel fusion and pruning.",1
"Background.In this study, we compared programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in primary tissue samples and its soluble form (sPD-L1) concentration in matched preoperative plasma samples from gastric cancer patients to understand the relationship between tissue and plasma PD-L1 expression and to determine its diagnostic and prognostic value.Methods.PD-L1 expression in tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and sPD-L1 concentration in plasma was quantified by ELISA. The levels of the CD274 gene, which encodes for PD-L1 protein, were examined as part of bulk tissue RNA-sequencing analyses. Additionally, we evaluated the association between sPD-L1 levels and various laboratory parameters, disease characteristics, and patient outcomes.Results.GC patients had significantly higher levels of sPD-L1 in their plasma (71.69 pg/mL) compared to healthy controls (35.34 pg/mL) (p<0.0001). Moreover, sPD-L1 levels were significantly correlated with tissue PD-L1 protein, CD274 mRNA expression, larger tumor size, advanced tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis. Elevated sPD-L1 levels (>103.5 ng/mL) were associated with poor overall survival (HR=2.16, 95%CI 1.15–4.08, p=0.017). Furthermore, intratumoral neutrophil and dendritic cell levels were directly correlated with plasma sPD-L1 concentration in the GC patients.Conclusions.sPD-L1 was readily measurable in GC patients, and its level was associated with GC tissue PD-L1 expression, greater immune cell infiltration, disease progression, and survival. Thus, sPD-L1 may be a useful minimally invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in GC patients.","AbstractAlthough immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness is correlated with intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression, there are no clinically available methods to improve sensitivity to ICIs by modulating PD-L1 expression. mRNA vaccines stimulate robust interferon-dependent innate immune activation leading to four-fold increases in PD-L1 expression on peripheral and intratumoral myeloid cells and enhanced sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade in preclinical models (Sayour, Grippin, and others, NanoLetters, 2018; Mendez-Gomez, and others, Cell, 2024). We hypothesized that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-COV-2 would similarly enhance PD-L1 expression in intracranial tumors. To test this hypothesis, we utilized institutional databases to identify 5,524 patients at our institution with pathology reports including the term “PD-L1” from August 2020 to November 2023. Pathological data and dates of SARS-COV-2 vaccination were compiled for each patient. Across the entire cohort (n=5,524), receipt of a SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of biopsy was associated with a 55% increase in mean tumor proportion score (TPS) (14% vs 8.9%, p=0.029). In the subset of patients with intracranial tumors (n=187), receipt of a SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of biopsy was associated with a massive increase in TPS (57% vs 7.2%, p<0.001). To evaluate the impact of this change on clinical outcomes with immunotherapy, we utilized a second institutional database to assemble a cohort of patients with Stage IV melanoma with intracranial metastasis treated with immune checkpoint blockade during the period August 2020 through November 2023. Patients who received a SARS-COV-2 vaccine within 100 days of initiation of ICI (n=10) exhibited numerically improved overall survival compared to those without SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccine (n=38) (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22-1.2, p=0.06). Median overall survival was 545 days among patients without COVID mRNA vaccination and was not met among those with COVID mRNA vaccination. This data supports further investigation of the immune modulating effect of SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with intracranial tumors treated with immune checkpoint blockade.",0
"Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer (BC) depends on the recognition of bacteria by extracellular toll-like receptors (TLRs) or the detection of mycobacterial DNA by endosomal TLRs or the cGAS-STING pathway. Agonists related to these innate immune pathways have been developed as adjuvants to potentiate the effects of immunotherapy. As innate immune pathways are important for the action of BCG and other agonists proposed for BC therapy, we decided to investigate the presence of mutations in the main receptors of these pathways. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was screened to identify BC-related mutations (apart from oncogenes), targeting, in particular, TLRs, the adaptor molecule MyD88, and the cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes) immune pathway. Among 1,724 BC entries, 103 mutations were identified in 80 affected cases in the cohort. TLR9 and TLR10 ranked among the most frequent mutated genes observed in the affected cases in our search (13 mutations each). Through all analyzed data, the search for MYD88 gene recovered only 1 mutation input in the database. Mutations in the STING and cGAS genes were found in one and four cases, respectively. We also evaluated clinical data, including the pathologic stage of BC, and gene expression from 103 mutations entries. This article attempts to highlight the relevance of mutations in genes coding for innate immune molecules in BC samples as potential biomarkers to predict individual disease outcome, and specifically to help find the appropriate treatment for each person in the future.","The integration of nanotechnology and synthetic biology could lay the framework for new classes of engineered biosensors that produce amplified readouts of disease states. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of this vision, here we present an engineered gene circuit that, in response to cancer-associated transcriptional deregulation, expresses heterologous enzyme biomarkers whose activity can be measured by nanoparticle sensors that generate amplified detection readouts. Specifically, we designed a AND-gate gene circuit that integrates the activity of two ovarian cancer-specific synthetic promoters to drive the expression of a heterologous protein output, secreted Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease, exclusively from within tumor cells. Nanoparticle probes were engineered to carry a TEV-specific peptide substrate in order to measure the activity of the circuit-generated enzyme to yield amplified detection signals measurable in the urine or blood. We applied our integrated sense-and-respond system in a mouse model of disseminated ovarian cancer, where we demonstrated measurement of circuit-specific TEV protease activity both in vivo using exogenously administered nanoparticle sensors and ex vivo using quenched fluorescent probes. We envision that this work will lay the foundation for how synthetic biology and nanotechnology can be meaningfully integrated to achieve next-generation engineered biosensors.",1
"PurposePediatric solid tumors are significantly different from adult tumors. Studies have revealed genomic aberrations in pediatric solid tumors, but these analyses were based on Western populations. Currently, it is not known to what extent the existing genomic findings represent differences in ethnic backgrounds. ExperimentalDesignWe retrospectively analyzed the basic clinical characteristics of the patients, including age, cancer type, and sex distribution, and further analyzed the somatic and germline mutations of cancer-related genes in a Chinese pediatric cohort. In addition, we investigated the clinical significance of genomic mutations on therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic, and preventive actions. ResultsOur study enrolled 318 pediatric patients, including 234 patients with CNS tumors and 84 patients with non-CNS tumors. Somatic mutation analysis showed that there were significant differences in mutation types between CNS tumors and non-CNS tumors. P/LP germline variants were identified in 8.49% of patients. In total, 42.8% patients prompted diagnostic, 37.7% patients prompted prognostic, 58.2% patients prompted therapeutic, and 8.5% patients prompted tumor-predisposing and preventive, and we found that genomic findings might improve clinical management.ConclusionsOur study is the first large-scale study to analyze the landscape of genetic mutations in pediatric patients with solid tumors in China. Genomic findings in CNS and non-CNS solid pediatric tumors provide evidence for the clinical classification and individualized treatment of pediatric tumors, and they will facilitate improvement of clinical management. Data presented in this study should serve as a reference to guide the future design of clinical trials.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04756-5.","Background and aimsLiver fibrosis (LF) is the common pathological process of almost all liver diseases, but the pathogenesis is extremely complicated and has not been fully clarified. Therefore, we want to explore LF’s complex pathogenesis and identify key genetic markers that can predict LF prognosis.MethodsFrom Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,  we contained datasets GSE84044 and GSE130970. And involved GSE15654 whose survival data were for the validation of our model’s prognostic value. Then, Bulk RNA sequencing was used to establish a LF-related prognostic model and to determine key genes.The key genes were later analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and the role of macrophages in LF was investigated.ResultsWe established a comprehensive LF-related prognostic model (FMSig, that is, fibrosis macrophage-related prognostic signature) containing four genes (IER3, AKR1B10, ADCY1, and PGM1). FMSig can distinguish between survival outcomes in dataset GSE15654. IER3 showed a higher hazard ratio than the other three FMSig genes. Moreover, further scRNA-seq analysis showed that IER3 is highly expressed in myeloid cells while the other three genes were rarely expressed in six immune cell types and other cell clusters. After reclustering the myeloid cells into seven clusters, we found that IER3 was highly expressed in myeloid cell cluster 3, shown to be related to anti-inflammation and lipid metabolism functions. Based on pseudotime analysis, we suggest that myeloid cell type 3 is transformed from myeloid cell type 0 in the liver cirrhosis microenvironment. On immunohistochemical staining, LF showed significantly higher IER3 expression than healthy controls.ConclusionThis study established a predictive model, FMSig, to evaluate LF prognosis, and showed that IER3 and macrophages are related to LF.",0
"Heterotrimeric extracellular matrix proteins laminins are mostly deposited at basal membranes and are important in repair and neoplasia. Here, we localize laminin beta 2 (LAMB2) at the sites of blood–brain barrier (BBB). Microvasculature (MV) of normal brain is endowed with complete LAMB2 coverage. In contrast, its cognate protein laminin beta 1 (LAMB1) is absent in MV of normal brain but emerges at the sprouting tip of a growing vessels. Similarly, vascular proliferation in high-grade gliomas (HGG) is accompanied by marked overexpression of LAMB1, whereas LAMB2 shows deficient deposition. We find that many brain pathologies with presence of post-gadolinium enhancement (PGE) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show disruption of LAMB2 vascular ensheathment. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in HGG blocks angiogenesis, suppresses PGE in HGG, prevents expression of LAMB1, and restores LAMB2 vascular coverage. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases shows that in quiescent brain LAMB2 is predominantly expressed by BBB-associated pericytes (PCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), whereas neither cell types produce LAMB1. In contrast, in HGG, both LAMB1 and 2 are overexpressed by endothelial precursor cells, a phenotypically unique immature group, specific to proliferating hyperplastic MV.","AbstractCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has emerged as a valuable liquid biopsy source for glioma biomarker discovery and validation. CSF produced within the ventricles circulates through the subarachnoid space, where the composition of glioma-derived analytes is influenced by the proximity and anatomical location of sampling relative to tumor, in addition to underlying tumor biology. The substantial gradients observed between lumbar and intracranial CSF compartments for tumor-derived analytes underscore the importance of sampling site selection. Moreover, radiographic features, such as tumor-CSF contact and blood-brain barrier disruption, are critical covariates that may affect biomarker detection and the abundance of plasma-derived analytes in CSF, respectively. Longitudinal intracranial CSF sampling, enabled by access devices like Ommaya reservoirs, may offer a window into treatment response and disease progression, though variability in analyte yield, sample volumes, and the dynamic effects of surgical resection pose challenges. This review critically evaluates the anatomic, radiographic, and longitudinal factors, or “time-space continuum,” that impact glioma CSF biomarker abundance. Practical considerations for longitudinal CSF biobanking, including access device placement and collection, are also reviewed. Key takeaways and recommendations for CSF glioma biomarker discovery and validation are provided as a “hitchhiker’s guide” based on our collective experience, along with resources for investigators aiming to develop CSF biobanking at their institutions.",1
"BackgroundGallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare malignant tumour of the bile duct. Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations in the early stage, it is basically at an advanced stage when discovered. Radical resection remains the only curative therapy for patients with GBC. The resection rate is relatively low due to tumour invasion and metastasis, and the overall prognosis is poor. For most patients with unresectable lesions, chemotherapy has been the only recommended treatment for decades. Immunotherapy combined with TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) was proven to be effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Some physicians have attempted to apply immunotherapy and TKIs combined with traditional chemotherapy in patients with advanced GBC. However, the outcomes were not clear because limited cases were reported.Case presentationWe present a case series of four elderly patients with advanced GBC who received tislelizumab and lenvatinib combined with chemotherapy. All four patients responded to this treatment approach. Tumour responses were better in Patient 1 (TMB-H, MSS), Patient 2 (low TMB, MSS), and Patient 3 (low TMB, MSI-H) than in Patient 4 (low TMB, MSS), in whom metastasis occurred during the later stage of treatment.ConclusionThe combination of tislelizumab and lenvatinib may be a promising treatment for patients with advanced GBC. The efficacy and safety need further confirmation.","BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promising results in treating blood cancers, but it has limited efficacy against solid tumors that express mesothelin (MSLN). One of the reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which consists of physical barriers, multiple mechanisms of immune evasion, and various biochemical factors that favor tumor growth and survival. These factors reduce the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells in clinical trials. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to enhance the effectiveness of MSLN-targeted CAR T cell therapy.MethodsTo investigate whether the antitumor efficacy of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells depends on the epitopes they recognize, we generated MSLN-targeted CAR T cells that bind to different regions of MSLN (Region I, II, III and Full length). We then evaluated the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan or an anti-PD-1 antibody in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe found that MSLN-targeted CAR T cells effectively killed MSLN-positive cancer cells (H9, H226 and Panc-1), but not MSLN-negative cells (A431) in vitro. In a mouse model of H9 tumor xenografts, all CAR T cells showed similar tumor suppression, but an MSLN-targeted scFv with Region I epitope, R47, performed slightly better. Combining irinotecan with CAR_R47 T cells enhanced tumor control synergistically in both H9 xenograft mice and patient-derived xenograft mice.ConclusionsOur results suggest that irinotecan can enhance the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells, and offer a promising combination therapy strategy for MSLN-positive solid tumors.",0
"SummaryBackgroundVEGF, a key mediator of angiogenesis and resistance to immunotherapy, is overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We aimed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of ramucirumab, a selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, given with pembrolizumab and the objective response rate of this combination as first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.MethodsIn this single-centre, phase 1/2 trial, which was done at Washington University (St Louis, MO, USA), eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with incurable recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2. Patients in phase 2 were required to have had no previous systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. In a dose de-escalation phase 1 design, patients received ramucirumab (starting dose 10 mg/kg given intravenously) and pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The recommended phase 2 dose of ramucirumab was defined as the highest dose at which one or fewer of three patients had dose-limiting toxicity during cycle one (primary endpoint of phase 1). In a Simon’s two-stage phase 2 design, patients received the recommended phase 2 dose of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab. Tumour response (primary endpoint of phase 2) was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (version 1.1). We hypothesised that there would be an objective response rate of 32% or higher (null ≤13%). Eight or more responses among 33 evaluable patients (those with at least one response assessment) was evidence for activity (80% power; one-sided α=0·05). Analyses were done per protocol. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03650764, and is closed to enrolment.FindingsBetween June 18, 2019, and Feb 11, 2021, three patients enrolled and were treated in phase 1 and 37 patients in phase 2. Median age of all patients was 64 years (IQR 59–72). 36 (90%) of 40 patients were men and four (10%) were women, and 36 (90%) patients were White, three (8%) were Black or African American, and one (3%) was Asian. In phase 1, no dose-limiting toxicity event occurred. The recommended phase 2 dose of ramucirumab was 10 mg/kg. Median follow-up for patients on phase 2 was 14·8 months (IQR 4·9–31·0). In phase 2, 18 (55%; 95% CI 38–70) of 33 evaluable patients had an objective response, including confirmed complete response in 11 patients, confirmed partial response in six patients, and unconfirmed partial response in one patient. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were dysphagia (14 [38%] of 37 patients), lung infection (11 [30%]), lymphocyte count decrease (ten [27%]), hypophosphataemia (nine [24%]), and hypertension (eight [22%]). No treatment-related deaths were recorded.InterpretationRamucirumab and pembrolizumab were safe to administer to patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, and the objective response rate with this combination as first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC was favourable. Further studies of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC are warranted.","Dichloroacetate (DCA), a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, is often used to treat lactic acidosis and malignant tumors. Increasing studies have shown that DCA has neuroprotective effects. Here, we explored the role and mechanism of DCA in Sepsis associated encephalopathy (SAE). Single-cell analysis was used to determine the important role of PDK4 in SAE and identify the cell type. GO and GSEA analysis were used to determine the correlation between DCA and pyroptosis. Through LPS + ATP stimulation, a microglia pyroptosis model was established to observe the expression level of intracellular pyroptosis-related proteins under DCA intervention, and further detect the changes in intracellular ROS and JC-1. Additionally, a co-culture environment of microglia and neuron was simply constructed to evaluate the effect of DCA on activated microglia-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Finally, Novel object recognition test and the Morris water maze were used to explore the effect of DCA on cognitive function in mice from different groups after intervention. Based on the above experiments, this study concludes that DCA can improve the ratio of peripheral and central M1 macrophages, inhibit NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis through ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). DCA can reduce neuron death caused by SAE and improve cognitive function in LPS mice. In SAE, DCA may be a potential candidate drug for the treatment of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10753-024-02105-3.",0
"PurposeTP53/EGFR co-mutation has been reported to affect the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, its impact on survival is unclear. In this analysis, we explored the prognostic effect of TP53/EGFR co-mutation in LUAD.MethodsClinical data and transcriptome sequencing of LUAD patients with matched genomic data were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for overall survival (OS) analysis. Differential expression genes (DEGs) were recognized by R software and bioconductor package. Clusterprofiler was used for functional analysis. STRING was used for estimating PPI information and plug-in CytoHubba to screen hub modules in Cytoscape. The association between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and survival was also analyzed.ResultsOS was shorter for patients carrying TP53 mutation (MUT) than that of wild type (WT) (37.7 m vs 52.8 m; p = 0.040, HR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.01–1.89). Dual TP53/EGFR-MUT was associated with inferior OS compared with the dual WT/WT cohort (38.4 m vs 51.9 m; p = 0.023, HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.95–3.52). 316 DEGs between dual TP53/EGFR-MUT and dual WT/WT samples were obtained and functional analysis made known that DEGs were strikingly enriched in regulating the metabolism of important amino acids, cell division, cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix composition. KEGG analysis discovered that DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and extracellular matrix receptor interaction. PPI network suggested that GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY genes were up-regulated in dual mutation samples. OS in the high TMB cohort was significantly better than that in the low TMB in patients with TP53 MUT(43.2 m vs 32.4 m; P = 0.007, HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81), as well as in the combination of TP53 MUT and EGFR WT group (44.4 m vs 31.2 m; P = 0.021, HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 − 0.89).ConclusionsTP53 MUT is a poor prognostic factor in LUAD patients, and the prognosis of TP53/EGFR co-mutation is worse. GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY may be novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for patients with dual TP53/EGFR mutation LUAD.","IntroductionOsimertinib, an irreversible third-generation EGFR-TKI, is the standard of care for second-line treatment of T790M-mutant advanced NSCLC patients whose disease progressed after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. In this multicenter study, we aimed to determine the real-life efficacy and safety of Osimertinib in pretreated advanced NSCLC patients with T790M mutation.Materials and methodsThis retrospective trial included advanced T790M-mutant pretreated NSCLC patients who received Osimertinib from 24 different centers in Turkey. Primary endpoint was time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety.ResultsOf 163 patients, 68.7% had EGFR exon 19 deletion and 22.7% had exon 21 L858R mutation. Osimertinib was given as second-line treatment in 96 patients (58.9%) and third-line in 48 patients (29.4%). After median of 13-month follow-up, median TTD was 21.6 months with an 82.2% ORR. Estimated median OS was 32.1 months. Grade 3–4 adverse events were seen in 11.7% of the patients.ConclusionOsimertinib is a highly effective option in second- or third-line treatment of NSCLC patients with T790M mutation, with a favorable safety profile.",1
"Giardia duodenalis, an important zoonotic protozoan parasite, adheres to host intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) via the ventral disc and causes giardiasis characterized mainly by diarrhea. To date, it remains elusive how excretory-secretory products (ESPs) of Giardia enter IECs and how the cells respond to the entry. Herein, we initially demonstrated that ESPs evoked IEC endocytosis in vitro. We indicated that ESPs contributed vitally in triggering intrinsic apoptosis, pro-inflammatory responses, tight junction (TJ) protein expressional changes, and autophagy in IECs. Endocytosis was further proven to be implicated in those ESPs-triggered IEC responses. Ten predicted virulent excretory-secretory proteins of G. duodenalis were investigated for their capability to activate clathrin/caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CME/CavME) in IECs. Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) was confirmed to be an important contributor. PNPO was subsequently verified as a vital promoter in the induction of giardiasis-related IEC apoptosis, inflammation, and TJ protein downregulation. Most importantly, this process seemed to be involved majorly in PNPO-evoked CME pathway, rather than CavME. Collectively, this study identified Giardia ESPs, notably PNPO, as potentially important pathogenic factors during noninvasive infection. It was also noteworthy that ESPs-evoked endocytosis might play a role in triggering giardiasis-inducing cellular regulation. These findings would deepen our understanding about the role of ESPs, notably PNPO, in the pathogenesis of giardiasis and the potential attributed endocytosis mechanism.","ABSTRACTIntroductionInhalation drug delivery can deliver high doses of chemotherapeutic drugs to the lung tumor. This study evaluates the efficacy and the mechanistic pathways of nebulized Cur NPs at various sizes to treat multidrug resistant lung cancer.Methods and resultsCur-NPs (30 nm and 200 nm) were nebulized separately onto the multidrug-resistant lung cancer cells (H69AR). Smaller NPs induced significantly higher cell death owing to a higher rate of particle internalization via dynamin-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Owing to the higher lysosome trafficking of Cur-NP30 nm compared to Cur-NP200 nm, oxidation of lysosome was higher (0.47 ± 0.08 vs 0.38 ± 0.08), contributing to significantly higher mitochondrial membrane potential loss (1.57 ± 0.17 vs 1.30 ± 0.11). MRP1 level in H69AR cells was reduced from 352 ± 12.3 ng/µg of protein (untreated cells) to 287 ± 12 ng/µg of protein (Cur-NP30 nm) and 303 ± 13.4 ng/µg of protein (Cur-NP200 nm). NF-κB, and various cytokine expressions were reduced after treatment with nebulized Cur-NPs.ConclusionsNebulized Cur-NPs formulations could be internalized into the H69AR cells. The Cur-NPs toxicity toward the H69AR was size and time-dependent. Cur-NP30 nm was more effective than Cur-NP200 nm to retain within the cells to exert higher oxidative stresss-induced cell death.",1
"PurposeThe anti-inflammatory environment of glioma reduces the efficacy of immunotherapies. Therefore, it is vital to transform the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma into a pro-inflammatory environment. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) can serve as immune checkpoint targets that enhance the anti-tumor immune response. However, the roles of Siglecs in the glioma microenvironment are unknown. This study was conducted to identify targets to inhibit the anti-inflammatory environment to improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with glioma.MethodsWe analyzed the regulatory effect of prognosis-related Siglecs identified from data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) and China Glioma Genome Atlas Data portal on the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma. The effects of prognosis-related Siglecs on the glioma microenvironment were investigated by determining the Pearson correlation coefficients of the Siglecs in transcriptome data from the TCGA database.ResultsSiglec-1, -9, -10, and -14 were closely associated with the prognosis of patients with glioma. The expression of these four Siglecs was significantly increased in the high-risk group and positively correlated with anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in the glioma microenvironment.ConclusionOur study provides insights into the effects of prognosis-related Siglecs in glioma immunotherapy, suggesting that targeted prognosis-related Siglecs can modify the microenvironment of glioma and improve the sensitivity of patients with glioma to immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03762-9.","AbstractImmunotherapies targeting glioma, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, offer new therapeutic avenues; however, their application has yielded limited success in clinical trials so far. Due to the antigenic heterogeneity of gliomas, targeting a few or several antigens still results in recurrence with “antigen-loss” tumors, indicating the need to engage the endogenous immune system to eliminate these therapy-resistant tumor cells. However, natural anatomical barriers and an immunosuppressive environment allow brain tumors to evade detection by the endogenous immune system. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound combined with microbubbles (LIPU/MB) has recently been shown to transiently open the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enabling penetration of cells and drugs into the CNS. Using intravital two-photon imaging, two-photon microscopy, multiparametric spectral flow cytometry, and bone marrow chimera mice, alongside blood samples from glioblastoma patients treated with LIPU/MB, we observed that LIPU/MB promotes migration of CNS antigen-presenting cells from the perivascular space into the periphery. To assess the immunological relevance of LIPU/MB-mediated CNS antigen presentation to the peripheral immune system, we have developed new transgenic mice (GFAP-minigene mice) with an intact BBB expressing four immunogenic peptides under the CNS-specific GFAP promoter. In GFAP-minigene mice, LIPU/MB combined with toll-like receptor 3 agonist poly-ICLC and Interleukin-2 promoted priming, activation, and homing of naïve CNS-specific T cells into the brain parenchyma. Cytotoxic T cell activity in the brain was accompanied by MHC-I and MHC-II epitope spreading, mirrored by the occurrence of endogenous T cells in the brain, deep cervical lymph nodes, and spleen harboring other CNS-(minigene) antigen-specific T cell receptors. Collectively, our findings suggest that LIPU/MB combined with poly-ICLC can overcome inherent limitations of immunotherapy by enhancing CNS epitope spreading and activation of naïve CNS-antigen-specific T cells within the context of an intact blood-brain barrier.",0
"Background: Medication dosing in overweight and obese children often involves complex weight-based calculations, leading to higher dosing errors, particularly with intravenous drugs. Currently, tools to aid in dosage calculations are lacking for these patients, especially in Thai population. Objective: This study aimed to develop a mobile application with the intent of utilizing it as a tool to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of dosing calculations required for obese and overweight Thai children. Methods: The performance of the application was assessed in 3 key aspects using a sample of 30 healthcare professionals. These key aspects included: 1) the accuracy of dosage calculations, assessed through pre- and posttests comparing manual calculations to app-based calculations using a 10-item questionnaire, 2) the time taken for calculations before and after app usage, 3) user satisfaction, which was measured through a questionnaire. Results: The integration of applications into the calculation demonstrated a significant improvement when compared to the manual calculation in both accuracy (6.10 vs 9.33 out of 10, P < .001) and efficiency (10.40 vs 8.53 minutes per 10 questions, P = .008). Also, the application elicited high levels of satisfaction among users, as reflected by an overall mean satisfaction score of 4.57 on a 5-point scale. Conclusion: The integration of this application to assist in dosage calculations for overweight and obese pediatric Thai patients has yielded favorable outcomes concerning accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Further development should be pursued within a larger cohort, with an emphasis on real-world implementation in clinical settings.","AbstractBackgroundPediatric nail disorders encompass a broad range of conditions. This article aimed to consolidate current knowledge on pediatric nail disorders to enhance diagnostic proficiency and clinical management among healthcare professionals.SummaryPediatric nail disorders present a diagnostic challenge due to their diverse nature. Non-syndromic congenital nail disorders encompass various anomalies such as anonychia/hyponychia, congenital malalignment of the great toenail, and racket thumbs, each with distinct clinical presentations and genetic associations. Syndromic congenital nail disorders, often part of complex syndromes, are characterized by unique features and associated abnormalities. Acquired nail diseases in children, like Beau’s lines and onychomadesis, typically result from trauma or infection, while melanonychia, although rare in children, requires careful monitoring for potential malignant alterations, with consideration for biopsy in cases with concerning features.Key Messages Pediatric nail disorders may pose diagnostic challenges and require a comprehensive understanding of nail anatomy and development.  Congenital nail disorders encompass isolated anomalies and syndromic associations, necessitating thorough evaluation for associated systemic conditions.  Acquired nail diseases may indicate underlying trauma or systemic illness and require careful assessment. Melanonychia in children requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation, emphasizing the importance of consistent follow-up and histopathological examination when necessary.",0
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent form of gastrointestinal malignancy with challenges in chemotherapy resistance and side effects. Effective and low toxic drugs for CRC treatment are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death, which has garnered attention for its therapeutic potential against cancer. Baicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is the primary flavone extracted from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis that exhibits anticancer effects against several malignancies including CRC. In this study, we investigated whether baicalein induced ferroptosis in CRC cells. We showed that baicalein (1–64 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of human CRC lines HCT116 and DLD1. Co-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (1 μM) significantly mitigated baicalein-induced CRC cell death, whereas autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (25 μM), necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (10 μM), or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (10 μM) did not rescue baicalein-induced CRC cell death. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the inhibitory effect of baicalein on CRC cells is associated with ferroptosis induction. We revealed that baicalein (7.5–30 μM) dose-dependently decreased the expression levels of GPX4, key regulator of ferroptosis, in HCT116 and DLD1 cells by blocking janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway via direct interaction with JAK2, ultimately leading to ferroptosis in CRC cells. In a CRC xenograft mouse model, administration of baicalein (10, 20 mg/kg, i.g., every two days for two weeks) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth with significant ferroptosis induced by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 axis in tumor tissue. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis contributes to baicalein-induced anti-CRC activity through blockade of the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 signaling pathway, which provides evidence for the therapeutic application of baicalein against CRC.","Aim: This study investigated the role of lncRNA LINC01232 in ferroptosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials & methods: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blot experiments were performed to examine relevant mRNAs and proteins expression. The kit assays evaluated malondialdehyde, iron, Fe2+ and glutathione levels. ROS levels were verified by flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation analysis monitored the correlation among LINC01232, H3K27ac, p300 and ARNTL2.Results: LINC01232 or ARNTL2 knockdown facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis. The interaction between LINC01232 and p300 resulted in the enhancement of H3K27ac levels at ARNTL2 promoter to promote ARNTL2 transcriptional activity. ARNTL2 overexpression reversed the promoting effect of LINC01232 knockdown on ferroptosis.Conclusion: LINC01232 inhibited the ferroptosis in CRC by epigenetically upregulating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL2.",1
"PurposePolypharmacy is a common problem among older adults. However, its prevalence and impact on the clinical outcomes of anticancer treatment, such as survival and adverse events, in older patients with advanced cancer have not been well investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from Japanese patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 2016 and 2019.ResultsAmong 157 older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients, the prevalence of polypharmacy, defined as ≥ 5 medications, was 59.9% (94/157). The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use, according to the screening tool of older people’s prescription (STOPP) criteria version 2, was 38.2% (60/157). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 3.7 and 5.5 months, respectively (P = 0.0017). The median overall survival (OS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 9.5 and 28.1 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between polypharmacy and OS, but no significant associations between polypharmacy and PFS. Polypharmacy was not associated with immune-related adverse events but was associated with higher rate of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment (59.6% vs. 31.7%, P < 0.001).ConclusionPolypharmacy is an independent prognostic factor in older patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI. Also, polypharmacy could be utilized as a simple indicator of patients’ comorbidities and symptoms or as a predictive marker of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03252-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundQingre huazhuo tang (QRHZT) is a traditional Chinese medicine decoction that has been used clinically by traditional Chinese medicine masters for more than 50 years with good results. However, its mechanism is unknown, and further elucidation is necessary.Aim of the studyTo verify the mechanism by which QRHZT regulates IgA nephropathy through immune checkpoints and ferroptosis by combining network pharmacology, single-cell sequencing and experimental studies.Materials and methodsThe single-cell sequencing data obtained from podocytes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) patients were screened, and the QRHZT target information was obtained from the ETCM database. Moreover, the KEGG, GSEA, immune checkpoint and ferroptosis data were analyzed and plotted using R language. Finally, the relevant immune checkpoint and ferroptosis targets were validated experimentally.ResultsQRHZT can regulate IgAN through the immune checkpoints FIT, FTH1, AKR1C3, and IL6 and the ferroptosis-related genes PVR and IFNG.ConclusionQRHZT has the potential to regulate IgAN, and omics strategies combined with network pharmacology is a feasible method for exploring the mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicines.",0
"PurposePostmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with T1–2N1 breast cancer is still controversial. This study was to evaluate the survival prognosis of T1-2N1 patients with or without PMRT.Patients and methodsFrom January 2006 to May 2017, 2606 female breast cancer patients underwent mastectomy in our medical center, among whom 402 patients of T1-2N1 stage with or without PMRT were finally analyzed. The median follow-up duration was 59.5 months. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS).ResultsIn the study of our center, no statistically significant difference was observed between the T1-2N1 PMRT and non-PMRT subgroups for the 5-year OS (94.4% vs 95.4%, p = 0.667) and DFS (90.1% vs. 91.1%, p = 0.798). By the date of the last follow-up, 8.96% (n = 36) of the patients experienced any recurrence. Univariate analysis revealed that PMRT was not a prognostic factor for either OS (p = 0.667) or DFS (p = 0.798) in T1-2N1 patients. We then did a meta-analysis on the current treatment patterns, in which 2606 PMRT and 4281 non-PMRT T1-2N1 breast cancer patients with mastectomy were included. The meta-analysis showed that PMRT didn't improve the OS of the patients (HR = 0.85, p = 0.11), but patients with PMRT had better DFS than those in the non-PMRT group (HR = 0.62, p < 0.001).ConclusionPMRT did not affect the survival of T1-2N1 breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy, suggesting that radiotherapy may be safely omitted for them.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04908-7.","Oral cancer is notoriously painful. Activation of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2, encoded by F2RL1) by proteases in the cancer microenvironment is implicated in oral cancer pain. PAR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed on neurons and cells in the cancer microenvironment. Sustained signaling of PAR2 from endosomes of neurons mediates sensitization and nociception. We focused on the differential contribution of PAR2 on oral cancer cells and neurons to oral cancer pain and whether encapsulation of a PAR2 inhibitor, AZ3451 in nanoparticles (NP) more effectively reverses PAR2 activation. We report that F2RL1 was overexpressed in human oral cancers and cancer cell lines. Deletion of F2RL1 on cancer cells reduced cancer-associated mechanical allodynia. A third-generation polyamidoamine dendrimer, functionalized with cholesterol was self-assembled into NPs encapsulating AZ3451. NP encapsulated AZ3451 (PAMAM-Chol-AZ NPs) more effectively reversed activation of PAR2 at the plasma membrane and early endosomes than free drug. The PAMAM-Chol-AZ NPs showed greater efficacy in reversing nociception than free drug, with respect to both level and duration, in three preclinical mouse models of oral cancer pain. The antinociceptive efficacy was confirmed with an operant orofacial assay. Genetic deletion of F2RL1 on cancer cells or F2rl1 on neurons each partially reversed mechanical cancer allodynia. The remaining nociception could be effectively reversed by PAMAM-Chol-AZ NPs. These findings suggest that PAR2 on oral cancer cells and neurons contribute to oral cancer nociception and NPs loaded with a PAR2 antagonist provide increased antinociception and improved oral function compared to free drug.",0
"Purpose:Low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer is a chronic illness commonly treated by repetitive transurethral resection of bladder tumor. We compared the efficacy and safety of intravesical chemoablation with UGN-102 (a reverse thermal gel containing mitomycin), with or without subsequent transurethral resection of bladder tumor, to transurethral resection of bladder tumor alone in patients with low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.Materials and Methods:This prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial recruited patients with new or recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer to receive initial treatment with either UGN-102 once weekly for 6 weeks or transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Patients were followed quarterly by endoscopy, cytology, and for-cause biopsy. The primary end point was disease-free survival. All patients were followed for adverse events.Results:Trial enrollment was halted by the sponsor to pursue an alternative development strategy after 282 of a planned 632 patients were randomized to UGN-102 ± subsequent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (n=142) or transurethral resection of bladder tumor monotherapy (n=140), rendering the trial underpowered to perform hypothesis testing. Patients were predominantly male and ≥65 years of age. Tumor-free complete response 3 months after initial treatment was achieved by 92 patients (65%) who received UGN-102 and 89 patients (64%) treated by transurethral resection of bladder tumor. The estimated probability of disease-free survival 15 months after randomization was 72% for UGN-102 ± transurethral resection of bladder tumor and 50% for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (hazard ratio 0.45). The most common adverse events (incidence ≥10%) in the UGN-102 group were dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and pollakiuria.Conclusions:Primary, nonsurgical chemoablation with UGN-102 for the management of low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer offers a potential therapeutic alternative to immediate transurethral resection of bladder tumor monotherapy and warrants further investigation.","Purpose:Intravesical mitomycin-C is recommended immediately after transurethral resection of bladder tumor for nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, a lack of compliance occurs due to the associated complications. Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravesical mitomycin-C before transurethral resection of bladder tumor in patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.Materials and Methods:This was a single-center, open-label, parallel-arm, randomized phase II clinical trial in patients with suspected nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer before transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2 doses of intravesical mitomycin-C (40 mg/20 mL) 1 day and 4 hours before transurethral resection of bladder tumor (n = 49) or no treatment (n = 50) with block randomization (size 2 and 4), stratified by bacillus Calmette-Guérin/intravesical mitomycin-C. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival and adverse events in the per-protocol analysis.Results:Seventy-one patients (33, intervention; 38, control) were well matched for baseline characteristics. Sixty-one had been followed without recurrence for at least 10.4 months; 3 and 8 patients showed recurrence in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The 1-year recurrence-free survival rate was 97% and 89% for the intervention and control groups, respectively. Neoadjuvant intravesical mitomycin-C resulted in a reduction (63%) in the relative recurrence risk (hazard ratio, 0.37; 80% 1-sided confidence interval, −∞-0.65, P = .11). Disease progression occurred in 3 patients in the control group (P = .051) but not in the intervention group. Neoadjuvant intravesical mitomycin-C was well tolerated, and adverse events were local and of grade 1/2.Conclusions:Two doses of neoadjuvant intravesical mitomycin-C are safe and effective in reducing nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer recurrence and progression after transurethral resection of bladder tumor.",1
"Aim: To develop and characterize doxorubicin-loaded sodium selenite nanoparticles (SSNP-DOX) and their surface attachment with cetuximab (mAb-SSNP-DOX).Methods: SSNP-DOX was formulated by gelation and then conjugated with cetuximab to form mAb-SSNP-DOX. Characterization included DLS, SEM, TEM, DSC, Raman spectroscopy and XRD. In vitro, the kinetics of doxorubicin release and cytotoxicity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells were investigated.Results: The zeta potential for SSNP-DOX and mAb-SSNP-DOX was -14.4 ± 10.1 mV and -27.5 ± 7.28 mV, with particle sizes of 181.3 nm and 227.5 nm, respectively. The formulation intensity was 89.7% for SSNP-DOX and 100% for mAb-SSNP-DOX, with PDI values of 0.419 and 0.251, respectively. SEM and TEM showed that mAb-SSNP-DOX was smooth and spherical. The DSC analysis revealed exothermic peaks at 102.44°C for SSNP-DOX and 144.21°C for mAb-SSNP-DOX, along with endothermic peaks at 269.19°C and 241.6°C, respectively. Raman spectroscopy showed a higher intensity for mAb-SSNP-DOX. The XRD study showed different peaks for each formulation. Both followed zero order kinetics for doxorubicin release. Cytotoxicity studies showed significant effects and high apoptosis in MCF-7 cells for both formulations.Conclusion: The mAb-SSNP-DOX showed promising properties, more effective doxorubicin release and higher cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells compared with SSNP-DOX.","Immune checkpoint blockade has been used to treat breast cancer, but the clinical responses remain relatively poor. We have used the CRISPR-Cas9 kinome knockout library consisting of 763 kinase genes to identify tumor-intrinsic kinases conferring resistance to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. We have identified the CDC42BPB kinase as a potential target to overcome the resistance to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. We found that CDC42BPB is highly expressed in breast cancer patients who are non-responsive to immunotherapy. Furthermore, a small-molecule pharmacological inhibitor, BDP5290, which targets CDC42BPB, synergized with anti-PD-1 and enhanced tumor cell killing by promoting T cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Moreover, anti-PD-1-resistant breast cancer cells showed higher expression of CDC42BPB, and its inhibition rendered the resistant cells more susceptible to T cell killing in the presence of anti-PD-1. We also found that CDC42BPB phosphorylated AURKA, which in turn upregulated PD-L1 through cMYC. Our results have revealed a robust link between tumor-intrinsic kinase and immunotherapy resistance and have provided a rationale for a unique combination therapy of CDC42BPB inhibition and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for breast cancer.",1
"BackgroundTrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells and many malignant tumor cells. However, data on TROP2 expression in advanced lung cancer are insufficient, and its changes have not been fully evaluated.MethodsWe assessed the prevalence and changes in TROP2 expression in patients with lung cancer who received anti-cancer treatments using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with an anti-TROP2 antibody (clone: SP295). IHC scores were graded from 0 to 3; grade ≥ 2 was considered positive for TROP2 expression. We defined a difference in IHC score, before and after anti-cancer treatments, as the change in TROP2 expression.ResultsBefore anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 89% (143/160) of the patients and was significantly more common in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma than in neuroendocrine carcinoma (P < 0.001). After anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 87% (139/160) of the patients. The distribution of TROP2 expression in post-treatment samples was analogous to that in pre-treatment samples when compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P = 0.509). However, an increase in TROP2 expression was seen in 19 (12%), and a decrease in 20 (13%) patients. Patients treated with targeted therapy showed significantly higher changes in TROP2 expression (P = 0.019) and thoracic radiotherapy was more likely to increase TROP2 expression than chemotherapy alone.ConclusionAlthough some anti-cancer treatments might alter the TROP2 expression, TROP2 was expressed in most lung cancer specimens before and after anti-cancer treatments. These results support the development of TROP2-directed therapy against advanced lung cancer in various treatment lines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03784-3.","Immunotherapy has revolutionized the systemic treatment of solid tumors, including advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC), providing durable responses with a favorable safety profile. Multiple immune checkpoint inhibitor agents have been approved in monotherapy in second-line setting, and for a selected group of chemo-naïve cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression. Despite the incorporation of immunotherapy to the systemic treatment landscape of aUC, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in frontline setting for vast majority of patients. Urothelial carcinoma is a chemosensitive disease with response rates of up to 50% to frontline chemotherapy. However, the response to chemotherapy is short lasting with vast majority of patients experiencing disease progression and death within months. In this context, maintenance therapy constitutes an attractive therapeutic strategy to maximize the time to treatment failure. Different cytotoxic and targeted agents have been investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC but have not shown an impact on survival. Avelumab has become the first and only drug to improve overall survival as maintenance therapy after frontline platinum-based therapy in aUC patients and the first drug to be approved in this setting. This article will review the rational for maintenance therapy, the different drugs investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC, and the impact of avelumab maintenance therapy as a new standard of care in the management of aUC.",1
"Natural killer (NK)-cells have potent anti-tumor effects, yet it remains unclear if they are effective for patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In a phase I clinical trial, we treated 12 patients (median age 60 years) with refractory AML (median 5 lines of prior therapy, median bone marrow blast count of 47%) with fludarabine/cytarabine followed by 6 infusions of NK-cells expanded from haploidentical donors using K562 feeder cells expressing membrane-bound IL21 and 4-1BBL. Patients received 106–107/kg/dose. No toxicity or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed and MTD was not reached. Seven patients (58.3%) responded and achieved a complete remission (CR) with/without count recovery. Median time to best response was 48 days. Five responding patients proceeded to a haploidentical transplant from the same donor. After a median follow-up of 52 months, 1-year overall survival (OS) for the entire group was 41.7%, better for patients who responded with CR/CRi (57.14%), and for patients who responded and underwent transplantation (60%). Persistence and expansion of donor-derived NK-cells were identified in patients’ blood, and serum IFNγ levels rose concurrently with NK cell infusions. A higher count-functional inhibitory KIR was associated with higher likelihood of achieving CR/CRi. In conclusion, we observed a significant response to ex vivo expanded NK-cell administration in refractory AML patients without adverse effects.","BackgroundTyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-PD-1 antibodies in combination provide survival benefits for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). However, the tool used to determine which patients likely benefit most from this treatment strategy has not been reported. We sought to develop a prognostic scoring system based on tumor burden score (TBS) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to predict the long-term prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies.MethodsData on patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies from multiple centers were collected. The prognostic accuracy of TBS, AFP, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and CTA (Combined TBS and AFP) for 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated.ResultsOverall, 278 patients with uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies were enrolled, including 48 BCLC-B and 230 BCLC-C HCC patients. CTA (AUC = 0.721 and 0.683) outperformed TBS (AUC = 0.680 and 0.621), AFP (AUC = 0.606 and 0.594), and BCLC staging (AUC = 0.551 and 0.555) in predicting PFS and OS. The 2-year PFS and OS for low CTA (low TBS/low AFP) were 65.7% and 94.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than 21.6% and 44.9% (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002), respectively, for intermediate CTA (low TBS/high AFP or high TBS/low AFP) and 8.7% and 12.1% (both p < 0.001), respectively, for high CTA (high TBS/high AFP). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that CTA grading was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS (referent: low CTA; intermediate CTA, HR 2.87 and 7.17; high CTA, HR 5.52 and 10.31, respectively).ConclusionsCTA grading is an accurate tool for stratifying the prognosis of uHCC treated with TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibodies and may help determine which patients may benefit more from this treatment strategy.",0
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the sixth most common malignancy but the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. Significant breakthroughs have been made in systemic treatment for HCC over the past two decades, which have improved treatment outcomes. In addition to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (mTKIs), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic drugs are increasingly being applied. The combination of ICI and antiangiogenic or dual ICIs has become the new standard of care due to remarkable response rates. However, currently available systemic regimens are primarily reserved for certain patients in the intermediate and advanced stages who will not benefit from locoregional treatments. Evidence supporting the use of systemic treatment as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies in patients with early-stage HCC, especially the high risk of recurrence after curative treatments, remains limited. This review identified recent developments in systemic therapy, including mTKIs and ICIs, considering results on first- and second-line treatment, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and combination with loco-regional therapy. Various ongoing clinical trials regarding the role of systemic therapies and potential novel targets in patients with early-, intermediate-, and advanced-stage HCC were also summarized and revealed that systemic therapy is no longer limited to advanced-stage HCC. Moreover, the introduction of T-cell redirecting strategies, including bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, has revolutionized the treatment landscape for HCC. Future research should focus on an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms governing the establishment of tumor barriers.","PurposeNeoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection is one of the preferred treatment option for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) factor exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutations, the use of MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed high efficiency and reduced toxicity compared with first-line standard chemotherapy. However, it is unknown whether preoperative induction targeted therapy of MET-TKIs is feasible and safe.MethodsHere, we reported 3 cases of locally advanced unresectable NSCLC with METex14 mutations receiving induction therapy of MET-TKI savolitinib as first-line therapy or second-line therapy when they experienced disease progression after preoperative chemotherapy.ResultsAll these 3 patients achieved significant tumor size shrinkage and their unresectable tumors became resectable after the treatment of savolitinib. No serious adverse events were observed during the treatment. They recovered well postoperatively, and no significant events were identified.ConclusionsPreoperative induction treatment with MET-TKI savolitinib showed its safety and effectiveness and may be an alternative option for neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC patients with METex14 mutations.",1
"BackgroundThe survival benefit of first-line epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in super-elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring active EGFR mutations remains unclear.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective evaluation of the difference in the overall survival (OS) among super-elderly (aged ≥ 85 years) NSCLC patients who had received best supportive care alone (BSC group, n = 36), cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT group, n = 11) or EGFR-TKI therapy (TKI group, n = 22).ResultsThe median age of the patients was 88 years. Among the 35 super-elderly NSCLC patients with an performance status (PS) score of 0–2, 11of 18 EGFR wild-type patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy and 15 of 17 EGFR-mutant patients received EGFR-TKI therapy with gefitinib (n = 13) or osimertinib (n = 2). The OS tended to be longer in the TKI group than in the CT or BSC group (16.9 months vs. 7.2 months or 9.8 months, p = 0.059). Among the 34 super-elderly NSCLC patients with a PS score of 3–4, 7 with EGFR-mutant received gefitinib therapy and the remaining 27 received BSC alone. The OS tended to be longer in the TKI group than in the BSC group (4.6 months vs. 2.3 months, p = 0.060). Multivariate analysis identified a good PS before the start of first-line therapy and presence of active EGFR mutations reduced a risk of death.ConclusionsGefitinib appears to be useful as a salvage therapy in super-elderly NSCLC patients with active EGFR mutation, regardless of their PS.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent a major advance in the treatment of cancer. Most studies of ICI have underestimated their cardiotoxicity; however, an increasing number of cases of cardiotoxicity are being reported. Herein we discussed a 67-year-old, male, Japanese patient who presented with cardiogenic shock accompanied by sick sinus syndrome 4 days into his second course of ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination therapy. A temporary transvenous pacemaker was subsequently placed, and a permanent pacemaker was implanted for persistent, symptomatic, intermittent bradycardia. The permanent implantation of the pacemaker improved his symptoms and allowed him to continue his ICI therapy.",0
"Primary liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the United States in 2023. Hispanic people constitute approximately 19% of the nation’s total population according to the US Census. Hispanic patients have the highest relative incidence rates of liver cancer compared to non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks, a disparity frequently overlooked in cancer research. In this study, our primary objective was to analyze the potential underrepresentation of Hispanic individuals in liver cancer research databases. We identified databases that had liver cancer-specific studies and be population-based in the United States. Our search yielded 7 cancer genomic databases, which were analyzed according to incidence percentages across ethnicity and race categories. Our study included 3104 patients; ethnic data was not reported for 13.1% (n = 406) of the patients. Samples were predominantly from individuals who identified as Not Hispanic (81.0%), Hispanic individuals represented 5.9%. Race was reported as follows: non-Hispanic Whites (61.0%), Asians (22.0%), non-Hispanic Blacks (5.4%), Other (3.1%), Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native (0.4%), Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian (0.2%) and not reported (7.9%). These findings collectively underscore significant disparities in the representation of ethnic and racial groups, particularly Hispanics. Given the present racial and ethnic demographics of the US population and the projected surge in the Hispanic population in forthcoming years, it becomes imperative to address health disparities that may worsen without efforts to enhance proper inclusion in cancer research.","Determining binding affinity (KD) is an important aspect of the characterization of radiolabeled antibodies (rAb). Typically, binding affinity is represented by the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, and can be calculated as the concentration of antibody at which half the antibody binding sites are occupied at equilibrium. This method can be generalized to any radiolabeled antibody or other protein and peptide scaffolds. In contrast to cell-based methods, the choice of immobilized antigens is particularly useful for validating binding affinities after long-term storage of antibodies, distinguishing binding affinities of fragment antigen-binding region (Fab) arms in bispecific antibody constructs, and determining if there is variability in antigen expression between different cell lines. This method involves immobilizing a fixed amount of antigen to specified wells on a breakable 96-well plate. Then, nonspecific binding was blocked in all wells with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Subsequently, the rAb was added in a concentration gradient to all wells. A range of concentrations was chosen to allow the rAb to reach saturation, that is, a concentration of antibody at which all antigens are continuously bound by the rAb. In designated wells without immobilized antigen, nonspecific binding of the rAb can be determined. By subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding in the wells with immobilized antigen, specific binding of the rAb to the antigen can be determined. The KD of the rAb was calculated from the resulting saturation binding curve. As an example, binding affinity was determined using radiolabeled amivantamab, a bispecific antibody for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytoplasmic mesenchymal-epithelial transition (cMET) proteins.",0
"PurposePolypharmacy is a common problem among older adults. However, its prevalence and impact on the clinical outcomes of anticancer treatment, such as survival and adverse events, in older patients with advanced cancer have not been well investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from Japanese patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 2016 and 2019.ResultsAmong 157 older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients, the prevalence of polypharmacy, defined as ≥ 5 medications, was 59.9% (94/157). The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use, according to the screening tool of older people’s prescription (STOPP) criteria version 2, was 38.2% (60/157). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 3.7 and 5.5 months, respectively (P = 0.0017). The median overall survival (OS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 9.5 and 28.1 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between polypharmacy and OS, but no significant associations between polypharmacy and PFS. Polypharmacy was not associated with immune-related adverse events but was associated with higher rate of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment (59.6% vs. 31.7%, P < 0.001).ConclusionPolypharmacy is an independent prognostic factor in older patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI. Also, polypharmacy could be utilized as a simple indicator of patients’ comorbidities and symptoms or as a predictive marker of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03252-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BACKGROUND:Endemic and pandemic infectious diseases take a substantial toll on human health. Advancing understanding about the determinants of protective immunity could provide avenues toward improved treatments for infections. In 1983, a small protein and presumptive antiviral “interferon,” IFN-γ, was characterized as a factor released by antigen-stimulated lymphocytes that equips macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Shortly thereafter, IFN-γ became the first cytokine used for host-directed therapy of a nonviral infectious disease in humans. The ensuing decades of research developed knowledge about the induction of IFN-γ and its downstream target genes; provided an understanding about individuals with IFN-γ–related genetic defects that render them susceptible to infections; and documented the therapeutic impact of endogenously produced and exogenously administered IFN-γ on infectious disease.ADVANCES:It is now known that IFN-γ is produced by various lymphocytes. IFN-γ released by these lymphoid populations can act on cells expressing IFN-γ receptor plus the kinases (Janus kinases 1 and 2) and transcription factor (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) needed for signaling in response to IFN-γ. Although IFN-γ was initially considered to regulate macrophages, hundreds of human cell types express the signaling machinery and may have the ability to respond to IFN-γ.The hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) elicited by IFN-γ encode a variety of proteins, including enzymes, ion channels, and pumps. These molecules promote oxidation, nitrosylation, and acidification of intracellular microbes residing in vacuoles; restrict the availability of host metabolites and metals on which pathogens depend; disrupt microbial membranes; impair microbial uptake into or exit from host cells; or promote eviction of microbial pathogens. Given the cytotoxic effects of some ISGs, numerous suppressors and antagonists regulate the action of IFN-γ. These include type I IFNs, which can reduce production of IFN-γ; transforming growth factor–β and interleukin-10, which block IFN-γ’s ability to activate macrophages; and regulatory T cells induced in part by IFN-γ itself.Although both knockout mice and people with inborn errors of IFN-γ immunity are susceptible to diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections, the nonredundant role of IFN-γ in human host defense is narrower than in artificially infected mice. Growing knowledge of “Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease” (MSMD) reveals it to be neither strictly Mendelian nor restricted to mycobacterial disease, to arise from genotypes in at least 21 loci that impair production of and/or responses to IFN-γ, and to be phenocopied by auto-antibodies that neutralize IFN-γ. Besides reinforcing the importance of IFN-γ for macrophage antimicrobial defense, MSMD studies have uncovered multiple new facets of human immunobiology, for example, that interferon-stimulated gene 15 secreted by granulocytes promotes IFN-γ secretion by natural killer cells, giving the host a way to activate macrophages without recourse to adaptive immunity. Lastly, beneficial clinical experience with administration of recombinant IFN-γ has been reported in >1100 patients for prophylaxis or treatment of diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections.OUTLOOK:We now have a wider view of what it means to be an “interferon,” the cells beyond macrophages that IFN-γ equips, and the opportunities to prevent or treat infections that IFN-γ offers. Patients deficient for IFN-γ production but who can respond to it are candidates for adjunctive IFN-γ treatment or prophylaxis. Such individuals include those with MSMD as well as those with other immunodeficiencies, for example, people with HIV/AIDS, certain cancers, advanced age, or a disease-selective defect in producing IFN-γ during infection.Clinical use of IFN-γ will benefit from a deeper knowledge of IFN-γ biology. For example, future work could help answer the following questions: How are new IFN-γ–dependent genes born and regulated? How widely do transposable elements and endogenous retroviruses serve as functional components in the promoters of IFN-γ–dependent ISGs? What are the roles and structures of many IFN-γ–induced ISGs whose biology remains mysterious? What are the contributions of ISGs that are negatively affected by IFN-γ? How do regulatory loops among different IFN responses affect the course of infections? Hopefully, we can use the answers to such questions to design novel approaches to kill or restrict microbes that cause serious disease or death in the human population. We may also help treat some infectious diseases with an exogenous source of antimicrobial molecules whose production IFN-γ normally induces in the host.",0
"PurposeThis phase II trial is designed to test whether the performance status (PS) of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients (pts) can improve with chemotherapy if their poor PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of ≥ 2) is due to disease burden rather than comorbidities.MethodsAge18–65 years, Charlson’s comorbidity index < 9, serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dl, adequate bone marrow and organ function, & ECOG PS ≥ 2 as judged by the worst score of three independent physicians were administered 3 doses of weekly paclitaxel at 60 mg/m2/dose. The primary endpoint was an improvement in ECOG PS by 1 point at 4 weeks; others: toxicity (CTCAE v 5.0), quality of life (QoL) assessment at baseline and 4 weeks by EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13. Optimal Simon’s 2-stage design was used.Results Forty-six patients were included with a median age of 56 years (interquartile range, IQR 54–59), 12 (26%) had comorbid conditions, and 87% with ECOG PS 3/4. PS improved in 11 pts at 4 weeks and in 7 beyond this time point. Grade 3/4 toxicities are seen in 20% (most common: anemia and diarrhea). At a median follow-up of 4.8 m (95% CI 3.27–14.9), the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.3 months (95% CI 2.36–5.6) and 6.8 months (95% CI 2.47–8.8), respectively. QoL improved for global QoL, role functioning, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, pain in the chest, pain in other parts, and worsened for alopecia and sore mouth.Conclusions Abbreviated chemotherapy is a useful, well-tolerated strategy in carefully selected poor PS mNSCLC patients that can improve PS and QoL.Clinical trialClinical trial information: CTRI/2020/01/022617.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04617-1.","Objectives:Patients with lung cancer have high symptom burden and diminished quality of life. Electronic patient-reported outcome (PRO) platforms deliver repeated longitudinal surveys via web or telephone to patients and alert clinicians about concerning symptoms. This study aims to determine feasibility of electronic PRO monitoring in lung cancer patients receiving treatment in community settings.Methods:Adults receiving treatment for advanced or metastatic lung cancer at 26 community sites were invited to participate in a prospective trial of weekly electronic PRO symptom monitoring for 12 months (NCT03249090). Surveys assessing patients’ satisfaction with the electronic PRO system were administered at 3 months. Descriptive statistics were generated for demographics, survey completion rates, symptom occurrence, and provider PRO alert management approaches. Pairwise relationships between symptom items were evaluated using intra-individual repeated-measures correlation coefficients.Results:Lung cancer patients (n = 118) participating in electronic PROs were older (mean 64.4 vs 61.9 years, p = 0.03), had worse performance status (p = 0.002), more comorbidities (p = 0.02), and less technology experience than patients with other cancers. Of delivered weekly PRO surveys over 12 months, 91% were completed. Nearly all (97%) patients reported concerning (that is, severe or worsening) symptoms during participation, with 33% of surveys including concerning symptoms. Pain was the most frequent and longest lasting symptom and was associated with reduced activity level. More than half of alerts to clinicians for concerning symptoms led to intervention. The majority (87%) would recommend using electronic PRO monitoring to other lung cancer patients.Conclusions:Remote longitudinal weekly monitoring of patients with lung cancer using validated electronic PRO surveys was feasible in a multicenter, community-based pragmatic study. A high symptom burden specific to lung cancer was detected and clinician outreach in response to alerts was frequent, suggesting electronic PROs may be a beneficial strategy for identifying actionable symptoms and allow opportunities to optimize well-being in this population.",1
"AbstractThe clinical approval of platinum‐based drugs has prompted the development of novel metallo‐complexes during the last several decades, while severe problems, especially for poor water solubility, drug resistance and toxicity in patients, greatly hindered the clinical trials and curative efficacy. To address these issues, the concept of metallo‐prodrugs has been proposed for oncology. Some stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs provide new insights for designing and preparing site‐specific prodrugs with maximized therapeutic efficacy and negligible unfavorable by‐effects. In this review, recent progress in stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs in the past 20 years has been overviewed, where endogenous and exogenous stimuli have been involved. Typical examples of smart stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs are discussed regarding to their molecular structure, activation mechanism, and promising biomedical applications. In the end, challenges and future perspectives in metallo‐prodrugs have been discussed.","BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.",0
"AbstractPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease for which remarkable therapeutic resistance is the norm. Conventional immunotherapies, like immune checkpoint inhibitors, show limited efficacy in PDA due to a remarkably immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and systemic inflammation. This review discusses the potential of both exogenous and in situ vaccination strategies to overcome these barriers and enhance anti-tumor immunity in PDA. Exogenous vaccines, including whole-cell, dendritic cell, peptide, and nucleic acid-based vaccines, have shown varying degrees of promise but face challenges related to antigen selection, production complexities, and patient-specific factors. In contrast, in situ vaccination strategies leverage conventional cytotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, to induce immunogenic cell death and modulate the TME with the aim to stimulate anti-tumor immunity. While preclinical studies support the use of in situ vaccination, balancing the stimulatory and inhibitory effects is likely fundamental to eliciting productive anti-tumor responses in patients. Ongoing research seeks to identify new innovative strategies that can harness the endogenous immune response and trigger in situ vaccination. Overall, while both vaccination approaches offer significant potential, further research and clinical trials will be needed to optimize these strategies for improving patient outcomes in PDA.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",1
"Background and Aims:HSCs contribute to HCC progression by regulating multiple factors. However, the entire immunoregulatory functions of HSCs are still obscure. Here, we aim to investigate whether HSCs impose CX3CR1+ macrophages to protumorigenic properties in the peritumoral area.Approach and Results:In single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of patients with HCC, a subpopulation of macrophages specifically expressed Arg1 and Cx3cr1 in the peritumoral area and were highly enriched with retinol metabolism–related genes. Flow cytometry analysis showed significantly increased frequencies of CD14+CD11b+HLA-DR− macrophages with CX3CR1 in the HCC adjacent region where α-smooth muscle actin–expressing activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) showed colocalized expression of CX3CL1. Accordingly, in tumor-bearing mice, Cx3cl1 mRNA expression was notably increased in aHSCs within the adjacent HCC, where infiltration of CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages was mostly observed with decreased CD8+ T cells. In adoptive transfer and in vitro coculture of myeloid cells, we demonstrated that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrated and highly expressed arginase-1 by interacting with retinoid-enriched aHSCs in the adjacent HCC. Direct treatment of retinoids or coculturing with retinol-storing mouse aHSCs or human LX-2 cells significantly increased arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages and human blood CD14+ cells, leading to the suppression of CD8+ T-cell proliferation. Moreover, genetic deficiency of CX3CR1 in myeloid cells or pharmacological inhibition of retinol metabolism remarkably attenuated HCC development.Conclusions:We showed that CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages migrate and interact with aHSCs in the peritumoral region where retinoids induce arginase-1 expression in CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages, subsequently depriving CD8+ T cells of arginine and promoting HCC.","Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in solid tumors. Despite Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of CTC devices in various cancers, the rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs in lung cancer make them technically challenging to isolate and analyze, hindering their clinical integration. Establishing a consensus through comparative analysis of different CTC systems is warranted. This study aimed to evaluate seven different CTC enrichment methods across five technologies using a standardized spike‐in protocol: the CellMag™ (EpCAM‐dependent enrichment), EasySep™ and RosetteSep™ (blood cell depletion), and the Parsortix® PR1 and the new design Parsortix® Prototype (PP) (size‐ and deformability‐based enrichment). The Parsortix® systems were also evaluated for any differences in recovery rates between cell harvest versus in‐cassette staining. Healthy donor blood (5 mL) was spiked with 100 fluorescently labeled EpCAMhigh H1975 cells, processed through each system, and the isolation efficiency was calculated. The CellMag™ had the highest recovery rate (70 ± 14%), followed by Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining, while the EasySep™ had the lowest recovery (18 ± 8%). Additional spike‐in experiments were performed with EpCAMmoderate A549 and EpCAMlow H1299 cells using the CellMag™ and Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining. The recovery rate of CellMag™ significantly reduced to 35 ± 14% with A549 cells and 1 ± 1% with H1299 cells. However, the Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining showed cell phenotype‐independent and consistent recovery rates among all lung cancer cell lines: H1975 (49 ± 2%), A549 (47 ± 10%), and H1299 (52 ± 10%). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining method is capable of isolating heterogeneous single CTCs and cell clusters from patient samples. The Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining, capable of isolating different phenotypes of CTCs as either single cells or cell clusters with consistent recovery rates, is considered optimal for CTC enrichment for lung cancer, albeit needing further optimization and validation.",0
"BackgroundAn increasing number of studies indicated that metabolic reprogramming of amino acid metabolism may either promote or inhibit tumor progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of a gene risk signature associated with amino acid metabolism to predict the prognosis and immune characteristics of invasive breast carcinoma.MethodsLASSO Cox regression analysis was performed to construct and validate the prognostic risk signature based on the expression of 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes. The predictive value of the signature, immune characteristics, and chemotherapeutic drugs was also predicted. Finally, 9 significant genes were examined in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, and the predicted chemotherapeutic drugs were also verified.ResultsThe prognosis of the low-risk group was better than that of the high-risk group. The areas under the curve (AUCs) at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.852, 0.790, and 0.736, respectively. In addition, the GSEA results for KEGG and GO revealed that samples with a high-risk score exhibited a variety of highly malignant manifestations. The high-risk group was characterized by an increased number of M2 macrophages, a high level of tumor purity, low levels of APC co-stimulation, cytolytic activity, HLA, para-inflammation, and type I IFN response. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed that MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells express 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes differently. In addition, cell experiments were conducted to examine the effect of cephaeline-induced on cell viability, migration ability, and protein expression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and HIF-1α.ConclusionWe established a risk signature based on 9 amino acid metabolism-related genes for invasive breast carcinoma. Further analyses revealed that this risk signature is superior to other clinical indexes in survival prediction and that the subgroups identified by the risk signature exhibit distinct immune characteristics. Cephaeline was determined to be a superior option for patients in high-risk groups.","Breast cancer has a high incidence and high heterogeneity among women worldwide, but its lack of highly consistent in vitro research models has limited the translation of experimental results into clinical applications. The emergence of tumor organoids in the new era has aroused great interest among scientists. Organoids possess multi-omics characteristics highly preserved from parental tumors and offer advantages such as long-term and stable passaging and visualization in vitro. Thus, they have overcome multiple defects of two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). However, the lack of inter-organoid homogeneity, vascular-like fluid system and complex microenvironment has affected their wider applications, making it urgent to introduce new approaches for developing a more comprehensive functionality of this model. In recent years, the combination of tumor organoids with other innovative technologies has provided some relevantly important solutions and made it an optimal high-throughput and high-fidelity in vitro model. Here, we provide an overview of the development and optimization of breast cancer organoids, discuss how they have been integrated with several emerging technologies, and further summarize their applications in functional precision oncology. We believe that the intersection of new technologies has great potential in breast cancer translational research, which may finally provide new insights into organoid-guided breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment.",0
"Heart failure and cancer remain 2 of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and the 2 disease entities are linked in a complex manner. Patients with cancer are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications related to the cancer therapies. The presence of cardiomyopathy or heart failure in a patient with new cancer diagnosis portends a high risk for adverse oncology and cardiovascular outcomes. With the rapid growth of cancer therapies, many of which interfere with cardiovascular homeostasis, heart failure practitioners need to be familiar with prevention, risk stratification, diagnosis, and management strategies in cardio-oncology.This Heart Failure Society of America statement addresses the complexities of heart failure care among patients with active cancer diagnoses and cancer survivors. Risk stratification, monitoring and management of cardiotoxicity are presented across stages A through D heart failure, with focused discussion on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and special populations, such as survivors of childhood and young-adulthood cancers. We provide an overview of the shared risk factors between cancer and heart failure, highlighting heart failure as a form of cardiotoxicity associated with many different cancer therapeutics. Finally, we discuss disparities in the care of patients with cancer and cardiac disease and present a framework for a multidisciplinary-team approach and critical collaboration among heart failure, oncology, palliative care, pharmacy, and nursing teams in the management of these complex patients.","Problem:Vaccination in pregnancy guards against infection. Maternal antibodies, however, can inhibit antibody production in neonates. We sought to determine the effects of maternal vaccination on neonatal immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.Method of Study:We hypothesized that mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNP) vaccination allows for a de novo neonatal antibody response even in the presence of vertically transmitted maternal antibodies. Female mice were vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA-LNPs. Mice were then bred, and 21-day-old pups were inoculated with the same mRNA-LNPs. Spike-specific IgG ELISAs were performed using mouse serum. A SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide library to perform peptide ELISAs characterized high affinity binding domains within the spike protein. Results were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests.Results:Compared to pups of unvaccinated dams, there were high levels of spike-specific IgG detected in the pups of vaccinated dams at 3 weeks of life (p < 0.0001). After neonatal vaccination, pups of unvaccinated dams had higher spike-specific serum IgG than pups of vaccinated dams at 12 weeks of life (p < 0.001). Antibody specificity to peptide moieties within spike RBD were similar when comparing a vaccinated dam to her pup at Week 3 of life, with different binding affinities observed in the pups by Week 15 of life.Conclusions:Pre-existing maternal antibodies may partially blunt the initial neonatal antibody response to mRNA-LNPs vaccination. This vaccine strategy, however, does not prohibit the subsequent development of a broad range of RBD antibody specificities that may be protective.",1
"AbstractThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of Romboutsia ilealis on the immune function of broilers and the underlying mechanisms. A total of 48 one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were allocated to 4 groups as follows: broilers treated daily with 1 mL live R. ilealis in general anaerobic medium broth media (0, 1 × 104, 1 × 106, and 1 × 108 CFU/mL) from days 1 to 7. Samples were collected on days 8 and 14. The results showed that R. ilealis had no negative effect on the body weight of broilers (P > 0.05). R. ilealis significantly increased the levels of lysozyme, IFN-γ, IFN-γ/IL-4, and IgG in the serum (P < 0.05). R. ilealis significantly increased the levels of IL-4, IFN-γ, sIgA, lysozyme, and iNOS in the ileal mucosa (P < 0.05). R. ilealis significantly increased the mRNA levels of TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IgA, pIgR, iNOS, and MHC-II in the ileum (P < 0.05). R. ilealis significantly increased the relative abundance of Enterococcus and Paracoccus in the jejunum and ileum, ileal Candidatus Arthromitus, and cecal Romboutsia and Intestinimonas (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that Enterococcus, Paracoccus, Romboutsia, and Intestinimonas were significantly positively correlated with humoral immune function (P < 0.05). In conclusion, R. ilealis boosted the immune system, activated the intestinal TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway, and improved the gut microbiota in broilers.","ABSTRACTEpithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a member of the small hydrophobic membrane protein subfamily. EMP1 is aberrantly expressed in various tumor tissues and governs multiple cellular behaviors (for example, proliferation, differentiation, and migration). The resultant regulation of the cancer pathway is responsible for the metastasis of cancer cells and determines the risk of malignant tumor progression. This review provides an updated overview of EMP1 as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor contingent on the cancer type and summarizes its upstream regulators and downstream target genes. This systematic review summarizes our current understanding of the role of EMP1 in malignant tumor development, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for its potential use as the biomarker and therapeutic target.",0
"Background Abnormal metabolism is the main hallmark of cancer, and cancer metabolism plays an important role in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Therefore, studying the changes of tumor metabolic pathways is beneficial to find targets for the treatment of cancer diseases. The success of metabolism-targeted chemotherapy suggests that cancer metabolism research will provide potential new targets for the treatment of malignant tumors.PurposeThe aim of this study was to systemically review recent research findings on targeted inhibitors of tumor metabolism. In addition, we summarized new insights into tumor metabolic reprogramming and discussed how to guide the exploration of new strategies for cancer-targeted therapy.Conclusion Cancer cells have shown various altered metabolic pathways, providing sufficient fuel for their survival. The combination of these pathways is considered to be a more useful method for screening multilateral pathways. Better understanding of the clinical research progress of small molecule inhibitors of potential targets of tumor metabolism will help to explore more effective cancer treatment strategies.","Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine whether MRI radiomic features of key cerebral structures differ between women and men, and whether detection of such differences depends on the image resolution.Materials and Methods:Ultrahigh resolution (UHR) 3D MP2RAGE (magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo) T1-weighted MR images (voxel size, 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm3) of the brain of 30 subjects (18 women and 12 men; mean age, 39.0 ± 14.8 years) without abnormal findings on MRI were retrospectively included. MRI was performed on a whole-body 7 T MR system. A convolutional neural network was used to segment the following structures: frontal cortex, frontal white matter, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and corpus callosum. Eighty-seven radiomic features were extracted respectively: gray-level histogram (n = 18), co-occurrence matrix (n = 24), run-length matrix (n = 16), size-zone matrix (n = 16), and dependence matrix (n = 13). Feature extraction was performed at UHR and, additionally, also after resampling to 1.4 × 1.4 × 1.4 mm3 voxel size (standard clinical resolution). Principal components (PCs) of radiomic features were calculated, and independent samples t tests with Cohen d as effect size measure were used to assess differences in PCs between women and men for the different cerebral structures.Results:At UHR, at least a single PC differed significantly between women and men in 6/7 cerebral structures: frontal cortex (d = −0.79, P = 0.042 and d = −1.01, P = 0.010), frontal white matter (d = −0.81, P = 0.039), thalamus (d = 1.43, P < 0.001), globus pallidus (d = 0.92, P = 0.020), caudate nucleus (d = −0.83, P = 0.039), and corpus callosum (d = −0.97, P = 0.039). At standard clinical resolution, only a single PC extracted from the corpus callosum differed between sexes (d = 1.05, P = 0.009).Conclusions:Nonnegligible differences in radiomic features of several key structures of the brain exist between women and men, and need to be accounted for. Very high spatial resolution may be required to uncover and further investigate the sexual dimorphism of brain structures on MRI.",0
"Objective:Recent advances in Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease (RDD), notably molecular testing, targeted therapy, and PET-CT imaging, hold promise for better recognition and improved outcomes. This study presents patients diagnosed and treated in a “real world” setting, where navigating limited resources must be considered.Methods:This retrospective single-center review includes 15 adult patients diagnosed with RDD at Vancouver General Hospital between November 2015 and October 2023.Results:The cohort comprised five males and ten females with a median age 53 years (range 19–80 years). All 15 patients had extra-nodal disease; 11 patients exclusively had extra-nodal disease, and four patients also had lymph node involvement. Seven patients had tissue next-generation sequencing, identifying MAP2K1 mutations in four cases and a KRAS p.K117N mutation in one case that was treated with targeted therapy using trametinib. PET-CT was used for disease staging in four cases. Six patients with refractory disease tolerated lenalidomide and dexamethasone without significant toxicity; three patients achieved complete response, and three had partial response.Conclusion:This study highlights RDD’s diverse extra-nodal manifestations. Lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for select patients, especially those with refractory disease. Broad utilization of NGS and PET-CT can positively influence management decisions.","PurposeTo construct a nomogram for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients base on HCC-GRIm score.MethodsClinical cases of HCC patients diagnosed at Hunan Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital were included, and these were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 219) and the validation cohort (n = 94), and those patients were divided into low GRIm-Score group (scores 0, 1, and 2) and high GRIm-Score group (scores 3, 4, and 5). In the training cohort, independent risk factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed by independent risk factors. The efficiency and the clinical applicability of nomograms were evaluated using ROC curves, calibration plot, and the decision curve (DCA), and the patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups according to total score of nomogram.ResultsCompared to low HCC-GRIm score group, high HCC-GRIm score group with BCLC stage is more advanced (P < 0.001), and fewer patients received TACE (P = 0.005) and surgical treatment (P = 0.001). There was higher rate of the presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001) and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis screened 4 independent risk factors to construct a nomogram of HCC patients, including HCC-GRIm score, BCLC stage, albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), and glutamyl trans-peptidase (GGT). The consistency index (C-index) of the nomogram of the training was 0.843 (0.832–0.854) and the validation was 0.870 (0.856–0.885). The time-dependent parameter showed the AUC values of the training cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.954 (95% CI 0.929–0.980), 0.952 (95% CI 0.919–0.985), and 925 (95% CI 0.871–0.979), while the AUC values of validation cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.974 (95% CI 0.950–0.998), 0.965 (95% CI 0.931–0.999), and 0.959 (95% CI 0.898–1.021). The calibration plot showed the nomogram fits well onto perfect curves, and the DCA curve showed the net benefit of the nomogram at a certain probability threshold is significantly higher than the net benefit of the BCLC stage at the same threshold probability. Finally, all patients were divided into high-risk, middle-risk, and low-risk groups based on the total score of nomogram, and it showed effectively to identify high-risk patients.ConclusionThe nomogram constructed by the independent risk factors can predict the prognosis of HCC patients, providing an effective tool with clinical workers to evaluate the prognosis and survival time of HCC patients.",0
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an immune-enriched subset of breast cancer that has recently demonstrated clinical responsiveness to combinatorial immunotherapy. However, the lack of targeted interventions against hormone receptors or HER2 continues to limit treatment options for these patients. To begin expanding available interventions for patients with metastatic TNBC, we previously reported a therapeutic vaccine regimen that significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastases in a pre-clinical TNBC model. This heterologous vaccine approach “primed” mice with tumor lysate antigens encapsulated within poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid microparticles (PLGA MPs) then “boosted” mice with tumor lysates plus adjuvant. The use of the PLGA MP prime as monotherapy demonstrated no efficacy, suggesting that improving this component of our therapy would achieve greater vaccine efficacy. Here, we functionally improved the PLGA MP prime by coating microparticles with biotinylated streptavidin-conjugated using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminoproplyl) carbodiimide/ N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/Sulfo-NHS) linkers. This modification enhanced the immunostimulatory potential of our PLGA MPs, as evidenced by increased phagocytosis, maturation, and stimulatory ligand expression of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Therapeutic prime/boost vaccination of TNBC-bearing mice with surfaced-coated PLGA MPs significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastases by an average of 56% relative to mice primed with unmodified PLGA MPs, and a significant 88% average reduction in spontaneous lung metastases relative to untreated control mice. These findings illustrate that relatively common biotin-streptavidin conjugation formulations can positively affect microparticle-based vaccine immunogenicity resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy against established pre-clinical mammary tumors.","PurposeSoft tissue sarcomas (STS) are diagnosed in 4–6 cases per 100 000 people a year and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Around one-third of patients will develop metastatic disease that requires palliative systemic therapy. Current therapeutic options have limited activity, and new treatments are tested, mainly in phase II trials. There is high variability and no standardization of phase II designs. We aimed to analyze the current landscape of phase II studies in STS and evaluate how its statistical design can affect the results.MethodsFull-text phase II studies published in STS patients between 2005 and 2020 were identified and analyzed.ResultsWe have identified 102 trials, of which 77.4% were single-arm trials, 16.7% were randomized comparative trials (RCT), and 5.9% were randomized noncomparative trials. Including multiple cohorts, 22 randomized and 128 single-arm cohorts were analyzed. Nearly 80% of trials reported full statistical bases of the design. Over 20 different primary endpoints were used, with PFS as the most common in RCT trials (81.8%) and ORR (36.7%) and 3-months progression-free survival (PFS) rate (21.9%) in single-arm trials. Overall, 27.3% of RCT and 37.5% of single-arm trials were positive. Among single-arm trials, studies using 3- or 6-month rates were more often positive than those based on ORR.ConclusionsThere is high heterogeneity in sarcoma trial designs, mainly in primary-endpoint and hypotheses used for size calculation. There is an unmet need for standardization that will incorporate factors associated with the rarity of the disease, outcomes detected in previous trials and real-life studies, and specific characteristics of new therapeutic agents.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04149-0.",0
"PurposeThe crucial role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy has been broadly depicted. However, the molecular phenotypic linkages between m6A modification pattern and immunological ecosystem are expected to be disentangled in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for immunotherapeutic unresponsiveness circumvention and combination with promising drug agents.MethodsModification patterns of m6A methylation were qualitatively dissected according to the large-scale HCC samples profiling. We then determined the immune phenotypic linkages by systematically evaluating their tumor microenvironment composition, immune/stromal-relevant signature, immune checkpoints correlation, and prognostic value. Individual quantification of m6A methylation pattern was achieved by m6Ascore construction, intensified by longitudinal single-cell analysis of immunotherapy cohort and validated by the transcriptomic profiles of our in-hospital GDPH-HCC cohort. Candidate therapeutic agents were also screened out.ResultsThree distinct m6A methylation patterns were determined in high accordance with inflamed-, excluded-, and desert-immunophenotype. To be precise, Immune-inflamed high-m6Ascore group was characterized by activated immunity with favorable prognosis. Stromal activation and absence of immune cell infiltration were observed in low-m6Ascore phenotype, linked to impaired outcome. Patients with low-m6Ascore demonstrated diminished responses and clinical benefits for cohorts receiving immunotherapy. The above credible linkage between m6A methylation pattern and tumor immune microenvironment was robustly validated in our GDPH-HCC cohort. Single-cell dynamic change of m6A methylation level in exhausted CD8 T cell and fibroblast was depicted in immunotherapy cohort fore and art. Derived from m6A methylation pattern, seven potential frontline drug agents were recognized as promising choice for high-m6Ascore patients.ConclusionOur work bridged the credible linkage between epigenetics and anti-tumor immunity in HCC, unraveling m6A modification pattern as immunological indicator and predictor for immunotherapy. Individualized m6Ascore facilitated strategic choices to maximize therapy-responsive possibility.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04589-2.","In recent years, as more and more lung-cancer patients have been treated with immunotherapeutic agents, their survival has been prolonged compared to before. It is well known that BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase) is predominantly found in cells of the hematopoietic system. However, there is a distinct lack of literature on BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and its effect on the immune microenvironment. Consequently, the main goal of this investigation was to analyze how BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma affects its progression, along with its prognostic significance, through the utilization of bioinformatics online resources and publicly available databases. Data on the sequencing results and clinical records of lung adenocarcinoma patients were gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the expression level of BKT, TCGA categorized lung adenocarcinoma patients into BTK high-expression and low-expression groups. We investigated the effects of BKT on clinicopathologic, genomic, and immunologic characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma patients. We analyzed BTK mRNA expression in tumors and normal tissues using two key resources: Tumor Immuno Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER 2.0) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA 2). We analyzed the prognosis of the patients using GEPIA2 and validated the results using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, we assessed BTK protein expression by Human Protein Atlas (HPA). We sought to elucidate the clinical prognostic significance of BTK in The TCGA using the online tool GEPIA 2. Furthermore, to clarify the biologic roles and pathways linked to BTK, we conducted a genomic enrichment analysis of the information. To predict the proportion of various immune cell infiltrations in the immune microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed in the TCGA database, we performed an analysis using the TIMER online tool. Using TIMER and CIBERSORT, the correlation between genes co-expressed with BTK and the corresponding tumor-infiltrating immune cells was explored; finally, the relationship between BTK expression and immune infiltration and immune checkpoints in the TMB group and the high and low groups was analyzed by R language analysis using the TCGA database. The expression of BTK provides some hints about the prognosis of the patients. The high expression of BTK is involved in immune response regulation signaling pathways, leukocyte-mediated immunity, leukocyte intercellular adhesion, graft rejection, and complement. Analysis of the GEPIA 2 database showed that BTK was co-expressed with the genes FGD2, SASH3, NCKAP1L, CD53, ARHGAP30 and LPXN. Increased expression of the above-mentioned genes resulted in increased proportions of CD8 + T cells, memory CD4 + T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and decreased proportions of Treg cells and TH2 cells. In addition, our study revealed a strong positive correlation between various key immune checkpoints (for example, PDCD1, CD274, PDCD1LG2, CTLA4, HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and SIGLEC15) and BTK expression. In conclusion, increased BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma is closely associated with prolonged survival of lung-cancer patients. Moreover, the genes classified under the BTK high-expression group exhibit significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, suggesting a potential impact on the tumor microenvironment. We investigated the potential of BTK as a tumor suppressor gene in predicting prolonged patient survival. In addition, we further investigated the possibility that BTK further affects the immunotherapeutic response of patients by influencing the microenvironment of tumor immune infiltration, but the relevant mechanisms remain to be further studied.",1
"Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) has a poor prognosis. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) significantly affects the development and progression of various human tumors. However, the significance and pathological mechanisms of CDKN2A in COAD remain to be elucidated. We assessed expression levels, clinical significance, biological function, co-expressed genes, and enrichment of related pathways of CDKN2A in COAD using various databases, including The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, Human Protein Atlas, STRING, GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, and Linked Omics. Our investigation showed that CDKN2A was highly expressed in colon adenocarcinomas (P < .001). It is weakly expressed or not expressed in normal tissues. The survival time of patients with colon adenocarcinoma with high CDKN2A expression is significantly shorter than that of patients with low expression levels (P = .011). There was a significant positive correlation between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and the infiltration of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Moreover, there was a significant negative association between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and B cell infiltration. The ten hub genes included tumor protein 53, V-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten, cyclin D1, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, catenin beta 1, and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase. Mutations in the CDKN2A genome in colon adenocarcinoma reduce survival. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in apoptotic signaling pathways and multiple pathways related to metabolic progression. Our results indicate that CDKN2A can be used as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with colon adenocarcinoma. CDKN2A may regulate the occurrence and development of colon adenocarcinomas by influencing immune cell infiltration and metabolic pathways.","AbstractIntroductionEven in the absence of inflammation, persistent symptoms in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) are prevalent and worsen quality of life. We previously demonstrated enrichment in sulfidogenic microbes in quiescent Crohn’s disease patients with (qCD + S) vs without persistent GI symptoms (qCD-S). Thus, we hypothesized that sulfur metabolic pathways would be enriched in stool while differentially abundant microbes would be associated with important sulfur metabolic pathways in qCD + S.MethodsWe performed a multicenter observational study nested within SPARC IBD. Quiescent inflammation was defined by fecal calprotectin level < 150 mcg/g. Persistent symptoms were defined by CD-PRO2. Active CD (aCD) and non-IBD diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) were included as controls.ResultsThirty-nine patients with qCD + S, 274 qCD-S, 21 aCD, and 40 IBS-D underwent paired shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic profiling. The fecal metabolome in qCD + S was significantly different relative to qCD-S and IBS-D but not aCD. Patients with qCD + S were enriched in sulfur-containing amino acid pathways, including cysteine and methionine, as well as serine, glycine, and threonine. Glutathione and nicotinate/nicotinamide pathways were also enriched in qCD + S relative to qCD-S, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction, a downstream target of H2S signaling. Multi-omic integration demonstrated that enriched microbes in qCD + S were associated with important sulfur metabolic pathways. Bacterial sulfur metabolic genes, including CTH, isfD, sarD, and asrC, were dysregulated in qCD + S. Finally, sulfur metabolites with and without sulfidogenic microbes showed good accuracy in predicting the presence of qCD + S.DiscussionMicrobial-derived sulfur pathways and downstream mitochondrial function are perturbed in qCD + S, which implicate H2S signaling in the pathogenesis of this condition. Future studies will determine whether targeting H2S pathways results in improved quality of life in qCD + S.",0
"BackgroundReal-world safety outcomes between the two flat-dose nivolumab regimens demonstrated to be similar in a study of adjuvant nivolumab recipients for melanoma. However, this study was limited by a single oncology patient population, a small sample size, and insufficient study power. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of immunotherapy-related adverse effects (irAEs) between nivolumab regimens with differing dosing patterns in various solid tumor patient populations.MethodsSingle-center retrospective cohort study of adult patients with solid tumor malignancies who received nivolumab 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W, or who were transitioned from 240 mg Q2W to 480 mg Q4W from March 1, 2018 to March 31, 2022 were selected for analysis from an electronic health record generated report. The primary endpoint evaluated was the incidence of irAEs. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of significant irAEs and reasons for treatment discontinuation. These endpoints were compared by univariate analysis between all three cohorts. A multivariate analysis was then conducted for the primary endpoint.ResultsNivolumab 240 mg Q2W was associated with a statistically significant increase in the incidence of colitis whereas the 480 mg Q4W regimen was associated with a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pruritis. The incidence of irAEs was not different between the three cohorts, while the incidence of significant irAEs was higher in the 240 mg Q2W and 240 mg Q2W to 480 mg Q4W cohorts.ConclusionClinicians ought to be aware of differences in the irAE profiles between nivolumab regimens with differing dosing patterns.","AimWe aimed to evaluate the effect of concomitant proton pump inhibitors (PPI) use with nivolumab on survival outcomes in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in second-line setting.MethodsThe study was designed as a multicenter and retrospective involving patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving second-line nivolumab therapy. One hundred and nine patients with mRCC were divided into two groups based on whether they use PPI concomitantly with nivolumab: concomitant PPI users and non-users. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between the groups with and without concurrent PPIs.ResultsOf 109 patients in our study, 59 were not using PPI concomitantly with nivolumab and 50 were using PPI concomitantly. The median PFS was 6.37 (5.2–7.5) months in the concomitant PPI group and 9.7 (4.5–15) months in the non-users (p = 0.03). The median OS was 14.6 (7.1–22.1) months in patients on PPI concurrently with nivolumab and 29.9 (17.1–42.7) months in the non-users (p = 0.01). Accordingly, PPI use for PFS (Non-use vs. Use = HR: 0.44, 95%Cl 0.28–0.96, p = 0.014) and PPI use for OS (Non-use vs. Use = HR: 0.68, 95%Cl 0.22–0.88, p = 0.01) were found to be as independent risk factors.ConclusionsConcomitant use of PPIs is associated with worse survival outcomes in patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab. Clinicians should carefully consider the concomitant use of PPIs in such patients.",1
"Nanotechnology advancements have resulted in many sensors and devices for biomedical applications. Among the various nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), due to their size, shape, biocompatibility, and unique plasmonic property, are an excellent candidate for many biomedical applications. AuNPs, known for their easy surface modifications, robust nature, and photothermal activities, find application in drug delivery and cancer treatment studies. In this review, we are highlighting the recent trends in using AuNPs as nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy not only eliminates the primary tumors but also allows for the treatment of metastasis along with the recurrence of the tumor. AuNPs possess tissue-specific delivery functions that depend on the tunability in size and surface functionalization of AuNPs. AuNPs can be used to activate the tumor’s immune defense ability, or they can be used to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the interaction of the tumor environment and nanobiomedicine is very important. In the present review, we give an idea of the mode of action of AuNPs and various combinations of therapies for cancer immunotherapy.",Key Points•Therapy–mediated BCMA expression loss after belantamab or anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor T cells underlies teclistamab failure in RRMM.•Low/undetectable peripheral blood soluble BCMA reflects loss of BCMA expression by bone marrow plasma cells.,0
"Background and ObjectivesTo assess mismatch repair (MMR) status and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix and their association with clinicopathologic parameters.Material and MethodsExpression of PD-L1 and MMR status (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2) was assessed on 50 cases of SCCs of the cervix by immunohistochemistry.Results80% of tumor cells and 84% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed PD-L1 expression. 80% of cases had a combined positive score (CPS) of > 1, whereas 20% had a CPS of < 1. 94% of cases showed pMMR proteins, while 6% showed dMMR. 94% of the SCCs were HPV associated, and 6% were HPV-independent. All HPV-independent SCCs of the cervix showed PD-L1 expression, and all HPV-associated SCCs showed MMR deficiency. Between PD-L1 expression in the tumor and the grade of the tumor, a statistically significant association was noted (p = 0.022). All MMR-deficient SCCs were HPV-independent.ConclusionThis research highlighted the HPV association in cervical SCCs in the Indian population. Most of the cervical SCCs were HPV-associated. Furthermore, most of the HPV-associated SCCs were MMR stable. This study found no significant association between MMR status and PD-L1 expression in cervical SCCs.","PurposeEsophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most lethal gastrointestinal malignancies. Immunotherapy is a promising treatment modality for this disease. However, broader implementation of EC immunotherapy has been discouraged because of insufficient understanding of tumor interactions with the immune system. As with other malignancies, the current research on EC focuses on deciphering the immune cell signatures within the tumor microenvironment. However, the disease-elicited immune cell profiles in the paratumoral compartments are largely unknown.MethodsWe examined the immune cell signatures in 62 tissue samples from 16 EC patients in different esophageal tissue compartments: tumor tissue, peritumoral tissue, healthy esophageal tissue, and adjacent lymph nodes. We analyzed the proportions and distribution patterns of NK cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as their death receptor (FasR, FasR/DR3)-expressing subpopulations. The analyzed data were then compared and correlated with the patients' clinicopathological data.ResultsWe found that the FasR+ NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrated lymph nodes at the lowest levels and that the FasR+DR3+ CD4+ T cells were enhanced in tumors. The comparisons with the clinicopathological data revealed a major impact of active smoking on the reduction in paratumoral NK cells and the upregulation of FasR in tumor-infiltrating NK and CD8+ T cells. The lymph node metastatic stage, tumor stage, and Mandard grade correlated with the compartmental proportions of the evaluated immune cells.ConclusionThe novel association of the disease state with tumoral and paratumoral immune cell signatures suggests new possibilities for personalized immunotherapy for EC patients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03258-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"PurposeNeoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection is one of the preferred treatment option for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) factor exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutations, the use of MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed high efficiency and reduced toxicity compared with first-line standard chemotherapy. However, it is unknown whether preoperative induction targeted therapy of MET-TKIs is feasible and safe.MethodsHere, we reported 3 cases of locally advanced unresectable NSCLC with METex14 mutations receiving induction therapy of MET-TKI savolitinib as first-line therapy or second-line therapy when they experienced disease progression after preoperative chemotherapy.ResultsAll these 3 patients achieved significant tumor size shrinkage and their unresectable tumors became resectable after the treatment of savolitinib. No serious adverse events were observed during the treatment. They recovered well postoperatively, and no significant events were identified.ConclusionsPreoperative induction treatment with MET-TKI savolitinib showed its safety and effectiveness and may be an alternative option for neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC patients with METex14 mutations.","Interrogation of big genomic data and integration with large-scale protein-protein interaction networks and pathways, can provide deep patterns that are rare– yet can prompt dramatic phenotypic alterations and serve as clinical signatures. Mapping cancer-specific co-occurring mutation-pair signatures, in primary and metastatic tumors, is indispensable in precision oncology. The additivity of co-occurring driver mutations in different genes (in trans) can lead to powerful proliferation signals. Co-occurring rare in trans combinations can serve as metastasis markers; excluded combinations may indicate candidates for oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a tumor-suppressive mechanism. Our statistical framework of the pan-cancer mutation profiles of ~60,000 tumor sequences from the TCGA and AACR GENIE databases, identified 3424 statistically significant different double mutations in non-redundant pathways, that is, have different downstream targets that may promote specific cancers through single or multiple pathways. Our analysis indicates that they are mostly in primary tumors. We list actionable in trans mutations for 2385 metastatic tumors and provide co-occurrence trees of metastatic breast-cancer markers. This innovative work clarifies the mechanistic conceptual basis and establishes the first of its kind tool for identifying and predicting metastasis. Crucially, when coupled with their proliferative functions and pathways, and linked with drugs, it could provide an invaluable metastasis-targeting resource.",0
"Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) has a poor prognosis. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) significantly affects the development and progression of various human tumors. However, the significance and pathological mechanisms of CDKN2A in COAD remain to be elucidated. We assessed expression levels, clinical significance, biological function, co-expressed genes, and enrichment of related pathways of CDKN2A in COAD using various databases, including The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, Human Protein Atlas, STRING, GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, and Linked Omics. Our investigation showed that CDKN2A was highly expressed in colon adenocarcinomas (P < .001). It is weakly expressed or not expressed in normal tissues. The survival time of patients with colon adenocarcinoma with high CDKN2A expression is significantly shorter than that of patients with low expression levels (P = .011). There was a significant positive correlation between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and the infiltration of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Moreover, there was a significant negative association between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and B cell infiltration. The ten hub genes included tumor protein 53, V-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten, cyclin D1, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, catenin beta 1, and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase. Mutations in the CDKN2A genome in colon adenocarcinoma reduce survival. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in apoptotic signaling pathways and multiple pathways related to metabolic progression. Our results indicate that CDKN2A can be used as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with colon adenocarcinoma. CDKN2A may regulate the occurrence and development of colon adenocarcinomas by influencing immune cell infiltration and metabolic pathways.","BackgroundAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a highly prevalent form of age-related dementia. However, the underlying mechanisms of AD are largely unexplored.Materials and MethodsIn this study, bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify the possible therapeutic targets for AD. The GEO database was used to screen the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs). Enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network, and LASSO model analyses were successfully performed. Furthermore, an ELISA assay was also conducted to determine the expression of principal genes within the AD and control samples.ResultsA total of 416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were recognized based on the GSE48350 and GSE28146 datasets. The IL-1β and CXCR4 levels were markedly elevated in the AD samples relative to the control.ConclusionThe IL-1β and CXCR4 genes were identified as principal AD-related genes that can be targeted for anti-AD therapy.",1
"CLIC5 encoded protein associates with actin-based cytoskeletal and is increasingly thought to play significant roles in human cancers. We use TCGA and GEO to explore CLIC5 expression differences, mutation and DNA methylation, TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration. We verified the mRNA expression of CLIC5 in human ovarian cancer cells by real-time PCR and detected the expression of CLIC5 as well as immune marker genes in ovarian cancer by immunohistochemistry. The pan-cancer analysis showed that CLIC5 is highly expressed in several malignant tumors. In some cancers, CLIC5 expression in tumor samples is associated with poorer overall survival. For example, patients with ovarian cancer with high expression of CLIC5 have a poor prognosis. CLIC5 mutation frequency increased in all tumor types. The CLIC5 promoter is hypomethylated in most tumors. CLIC5 was associated with tumor immunity and different immune cells of different tumor types, such as CD8 + T cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, etc. CLIC5 was positively correlated with various immune checkpoints, and TMB and MSI were correlated with dysregulation of CLIC5 in tumors. The expression of CLIC5 in ovarian cancer was detected by qPCR and IHC, and the results were consistent with the bioinformatics results. There were a strong positive correlation between CLIC5 expression and M2 macrophage (CD163) infiltration and a negative correlation with CD8 + T-cell infiltration. In conclusions, our first pan-cancer analysis offered a detailed grasp of the cancerogenic functions of CLIC5 in a variety of malignancies. CLIC5 participated in immunomodulation and performed a crucial function in the tumor microenvironment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04927-4.","BackgroundCOVID-19 has created a significant risk to worldwide public health. According to recent research, C-type lectins may be SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Layilin (LAYN), a broadly expressed integral membrane hyaluronan receptor with a C-type lectin structural domain, is a gene related to cell senescence. There are a few studies on C-type lectins in pan-cancer, and no pan-cancer analysis has been conducted for LAYN. MethodsThe genotype tissue expression (GTEx) portal and the cancer genome map (TCGA) database were used to collect samples from healthy and cancer patients. Bioinformatics methods are used to construct immune landscape, mutation landscape, and stemness landscape of LAYN. The single-cell sequencing data were used from the CancerSEA website to analyze the functions of LAYN. The prognosis potential of LAYN was discussed based on machine learning.ResultsLAYN is differentially expressed among cancers. Survival analysis indicated that LAYN was related to a poor overall survival (OS) rate in cancers, like HNSC, MESO, and OV. Mutational landscapes of LAYN in SKCM and STAD were constructed. LAYN was negatively related to Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) in THCA, PRAD, and UCEC, and with the Microsatellite Instability (MSI) in STAD, LUAD, and UCEC. The immune landscape in pan-cancer suggested that LAYN may be involved in tumor immune escape. LAYN plays a crucial role in the infiltration of immune cells in malignant tumors. LAYN participates in methylation modifications and affects tumor proliferation and metastasis by regulating stemness. Analysis of single-cell sequencing data suggests that LAYN may participate in several biological processes, like stemness, apoptosis, and DNA repair. LAYN transcript was predicted as a liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS)-related RNA. The results of KIRC were verified in the GEO and ArrayExpress databases. Furthermore, prognostic models based on machine learning of LAYN-related genes were established. Hsa-miR-153-5p and hsa-miR-505-3p may be the upstream miRNAs of LAYN and have a high value for tumor prognosis.ConclusionThis study elucidated the functional mechanisms of LAYN from a pan-cancer perspective and provided novel insights into cancer prognosis, metastasis, and immunotherapy. LAYN has the potential to become a new target of mRNA vaccines and molecular therapies in tumors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04986-7.",1
"The P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated ion channel which belongs to the P2X receptor family, plays critical roles in recognizing extracellular adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) and is widely expressed in most tumor cells as well as inflammatory cells. Previously, the P2X7 receptor has been demonstrated to modulate the progression of various malignancies, including glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. However, the biological function and prognostic values of P2X7 receptor in hepatocellular carcinoma remain to be determined. Here, we investigated the expression level of P2X7 receptor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Then MTS and EdU assays were carried out to study the role of P2X7 receptor blockade in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, the underlying mechanism was further elucidated by bulk RNAseq. Compared to the control group, the P2X7 receptor was significantly up-regulated in the hepatocellular carcinoma group. Interestingly, A740003 and A438079, two selective antagonists at P2X7 receptor, significantly blocked Ca2+ influx and decreased the proliferative rate of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the expression level of chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CHSY1), an enzyme that mediates the polymerization step of chondroitin sulfate, was reduced by both A740003 and A438079. In conclusion, inhibition of the P2X7 receptor attenuated the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and this process was largely modulated by CHSY1. Thus, our findings reveal a previously unknown role for P2X7 receptor in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and imply that the P2X7 receptor may represent a new target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11302-024-10064-5.","AbstractBackgroundCD8+ T cells are critical for the oncogenesis and progression of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor microenvironment, receiving antigen signals from antigen-presenting cells and directly contributing to antitumor responses.SummaryCD8+ T cells mediate immunogenic cell death, facilitate immune signal transmission, and play a significant role in various treatments, including surgery, transarterial chemoembolization, and immunotherapy. Extensive research on the role of CD8+ T cells within the HCC microenvironment has shown considerable progress. Immunometabolic targets on CD8+ T cells have demonstrated potential in combination with immunotherapies for HCC; however, they have not yet reached the clinical trial stage.Key MessagesThis review provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on immune and immunometabolic targets of CD8+ T cells within the HCC microenvironment.

"AbstractOvarian cancer (OC), with its high mortality rate among gynecological cancers, is often diagnosed late due to the lack of early diagnostic symptoms and biomarkers. The tumor immune microenvironment has become a focal point in cancer diagnostic and therapeutic research. Among these, B7-H4, a checkpoint protein, plays a crucial role in immune regulation and tumor suppression, contributing to immune evasion within the tumor microenvironment. This study aims to identify the concentration of soluble B7-H4(sB7-H4) in the plasma of patients with OC and to evaluate its clinical significance. Through a comprehensive analysis involving enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and multicolor immunofluorescence, we quantified sB7-H4 levels in patient plasma and ascites, correlating these findings with tissue expression and clinical outcomes. Results indicated a strong association between high sB7-H4 levels and advanced disease, surgical outcomes, lymphatic metastasis, and platinum resistance. When compared with traditional biomarkers CA125 and HE4, sB7-H4, especially in conjunction with these markers, enhances the diagnostic accuracy for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), offering insights into disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. This comprehensive analysis suggests that sB7-H4 is a promising biomarker for EOC, providing valuable insights into diagnosis, stage differentiation, treatment effectiveness, and prognosis.","The P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated ion channel which belongs to the P2X receptor family, plays critical roles in recognizing extracellular adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) and is widely expressed in most tumor cells as well as inflammatory cells.

"BackgroundThe m6A methylation modification is one of the most common mRNA modifications, and involved in a variety of biological processes, such as cell death, cancer stem cell formation and tumorigenesis. Increasing evidences have demonstrated that the expression patterns of m6A regulators are significantly correlated with PD-L1 level some solid tumors, but few study has explored the function of m6A regulators in the immune microenvironment and prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsSurvival analysis was independently conducted for 20 m6A regulators to explore their prognostic value in NSCLC, and then the prognostic risk model based on m6A regulator expression profiles is built to stratify NSCLC patients. Also, the correlation analysis between immune infiltrating cells and m6A regulators is used to reveal the impact of m6A on immune microenvironment of NSCLC. Furthermore, to explore the function of m6A as biomarker of anit-PD-L1 therapeutic effect, we explored the associations of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1 levels to 20 m6A regulator expression patterns in NSCLC.ResultsFirst, the expressions of 20 m6A regulators in NSCLC tissues were significantly increased compared to normal tissues. Survival analysis revealed that three genes, METTL3, HNRNPC and VIRMA, were markedly correlated to the prognosis of NSCLC patients. In particular, cox regression analysis verified that METTL3 could be used as an independent prognostic factor to predict the survival rate of NSCLC patients. Second, the risk prognostic model built on seven m6A regulators can effectively stratify NSCLC patients, and the low-risk subgroup had better prognosis compared to high-risk group. Finally, a few m6A regulators showed significant associations with immune microenvironment, as well as TMB and PD-L1 level, suggesting that the m6A RNA methylation is indicative of therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 treatment.ConclusionOur study identified some m6A regulatory factors as independent risk factors for the prognosis of NSCLC, and the expression patterns of m6A regulators are also correlated to the immune infiltration, as well as TMB and PD-L1 level in NSCLC. The m6A regulators could be used as biomarkers indicative of immunotherapy to NSCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04032-y.","BackgroundDisulfidptosis, as a new mode of programmed cell death, is closely associated with tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, M2 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) plays an important role in tumor progression. Here, we propose to combine these two perspectives to detect novel disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related biomarkers in bladder cancer (BCa) to identify various tumor subtypes, construct prognostic features, reveal immune and somatic mutational landscapes, and screen for drugs in BCa.MethodsWe used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to mine M2 TAM-related genes. Consensus unsupervised clustering was performed to identify potential tumor subtypes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to build the risk model. We then explored the immune cell, immune function, immune checkpoint expression patterns and somatic mutational landscape in clusters and risk groups. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis for anti-cancer drugs.ResultsWe identified 3057 M2 TAM-related genes and intersected them with disulfidptosis-related genes to obtain 95 disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related genes (DMRGs). In terms of tumor subtypes, two molecular clusters were identified. Cluster 1 showed stronger immunogenicity and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). We also predicted 50 drugs with high sensitivity in cluster 1. On the basis of risk grouping, the high-risk group had poor overall survival in the training, test, and validation groups. Ten screened anti-cancer drugs were more sensitive in the high-risk group. A nomogram predicting survival of BCa patients was also established.ConclusionBy combining two hotspot perspectives, disulfidptosis and M2 TAM, we provide a valuable risk score signature for establishing individualized treatment regimens and drug choices. The risk score may serve as an independent risk factor for BCa patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05352-3.",1
"Background and Aims:Ambiguous understanding of tumors and tumor microenvironments (TMEs) hinders accurate diagnosis and available treatment for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) covering intrahepatic metastasis (IM) and multicentric occurrence (MO). Here, we characterized the diverse TMEs of IM and MO identified by whole-exome sequencing at single-cell resolution.Approach and Results:We performed parallel whole-exome sequencing and scRNA-seq on 23 samples from 7 patients to profile their TMEs when major results were validated by immunohistochemistry in the additional cohort. Integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing found that malignant cells in IM showed higher intratumor heterogeneity, stemness, and more activated metabolism than those in MO. Tumors from IM shared similar TMEs while distinct TMEs were noticed in those from MO. Furthermore, CD20+ B cells, plasma cells, and conventional type II dendritic cells (cDC2s) were decreased in IM relative to MO while T cells in IM exhibited a more terminally exhausted capacity with a higher proportion of proliferative/exhausted T cells than that in MO. Both CD20 and CD1C correlated with better prognosis in multifocal HCC. Additionally, MMP9+ tumor-associated macrophages were enriched across IM and MO, which formed cellular niches with regulatory T cells and proliferative/exhausted T cells.Conclusions:Our findings deeply decipher the heterogeneous TMEs between IM and MO, which provide a comprehensive landscape of multifocal HCC.","Immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) can induce life-threatening immune-related adverse events, including myocarditis and myositis, which are rare but often concurrent. The molecular pathways and immune subsets underlying these toxicities remain poorly understood. To address this need, we obtained heart and skeletal muscle biopsies for single-cell RNA sequencing in living patients with cancers treated with ICTs admitted to the hospital with myocarditis and/or myositis (overlapping myocarditis plus myositis, n=10; myocarditis-only, n=1) compared to ICT-exposed patients ruled out for toxicity utilized as controls (n=9) within 96 hours of clinical presentation. Analyses of 58,523 cells revealed CD8+ T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype expressing activation/exhaustion markers in both myocarditis and myositis. Furthermore, the analyses identified a population of myeloid cells expressing tissue-resident signatures and FcγRIIIa (CD16a), which is known to bind IgG and regulate complement activation. Immunohistochemistry of affected cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues revealed protein expression of pan-IgG and complement product C4d that were associated with the presence of high-titer serum autoantibodies against muscle antigens in a subset of patients. We further identified a population of inflammatory IL-1B+TNF+ myeloid cells specifically enriched in myocarditis and associated with greater toxicity severity and poorer clinical outcomes. These results are the first to recognize these myeloid subsets in human immune-related myocarditis and myositis tissues and nominate new targets for investigation into rational treatments to overcome these high-mortality toxicities.",1
"AbstractHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality; it ranks as the second most common cause of cancer deaths in China. Most HCC patients are first diagnosed at an advanced stage. In recent years, targeted therapy combined with immunotherapy has become the preferred regimen for systemic treatment of intermediate-advanced HCC, while targeted therapy combined with immunotherapy plus local treatment could further improve the efficacy in many clinical studies. To better guide the clinical treatment for effective and safe combination therapy, our interdisciplinary panel on the treatment of intermediate-advanced HCC comprising hepatologists, hepatobiliary surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, interventional radiologists, and traditional Chinese medicine physicians have formulated this consensus based on current clinical studies and clinical medication experience for reference. The consensus contained 15 recommendations, including the applicable population and management, local treatment selection, conversion strategy, treatment strategy after tumor progression and management of common adverse reactions.","BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.",0
"Head and neck cancers (HNC) are aggressive, difficult-to-treat tumors that can be caused by genetic factors but mainly by lifestyle or infection caused by the human papillomavirus. As the sixth most common malignancy, it presents a formidable therapeutic challenge with limited therapeutic modalities. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is appearing as a promising multitarget anticancer and antimetastatic agent. Numerous studies have shown that curcumin and its derivatives have the potential to affect signaling pathways (NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and EGFR) and molecular mechanisms that are crucial for the growth and migration of head and neck tumors. Furthermore, its ability to interact with the tumor microenvironment and trigger the immune system may significantly influence the organism’s immune response to the tumor. Combining curcumin with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy may improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the side effects of treatment, thereby increasing its therapeutic potential. This review is a comprehensive overview that discusses both the benefits and limitations of curcumin and its therapeutic effects in the context of tumor biology, with an emphasis on molecular mechanisms in the context of HNC. This review also includes possibilities to improve the limiting properties of curcumin both in terms of the development of new derivatives, formulations, or combinations with conventional therapies that have potential as a new type of therapy for the treatment of HNC and subsequent use in clinical practice.","AbstractIntroductionTreatment for relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis (AL) is an unmet need. The safety and efficacy of belantamab mafodotin (BLM) in multiple myeloma are known, whereas in AL data are limited.MethodsWe report a multi-center cohort of AL patients receiving BLM, and review all previous data on BLM therapy in AL.ResultsTwelve patients with a median of 3 (range 2–9) prior lines of therapy were included. The overall hematological response rate (ORR) was 75% (9/12), including 5 complete responses. Six of the 10 evaluable patients had organ responses. The median event-free survivals/overall survivals were 22.3 and 28.8 months, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities were mostly infections and keratopathy, occurring in 7/12 (58%). Hematological toxicities were rare. No grade 4/5 toxicities occurred. The review of the previous series reveals BLM provides an ORR of 60–83% with similar rates of corneal toxicity.ConclusionBLM, being an off-the-shelf therapy, with acceptable toxicity even in frail patients, may be a valuable option in AL, with a high ORR, and a signal for durable responses and high-quality organ responses.",0
"The heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are glycoproteins that consist of a proteoglycan “core” protein and covalently attached heparan sulfate (HS) chain. HSPGs are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and secretory vesicles. Within HSPGs, the protein cores determine when and where HSPG expression takes place, and the HS chains mediate most of HSPG`s biological roles through binding various protein ligands, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and receptors, morphogens, proteases, protease inhibitors, and ECM proteins. Through these interactions, HSPGs modulate cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis to display essential functions in physiology and pathology. Under physiological conditions, the expression and localization of HSPGs are finely regulated to orchestrate their physiological functions, and this is disrupted in cancer. The HSPG dysregulation elicits multiple oncogenic signaling, including growth factor signaling, ECM and Integrin signaling, chemokine and immune signaling, cancer stem cell, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence, to prompt cell transformation, proliferation, tumor invasion and metastasis, tumor angiogenesis and inflammation, and immunotolerance. These oncogenic roles make HSPGs an attractive pharmacological target for anti-cancer therapy. Several therapeutic strategies have been under development, including anti-HSPG antibodies, peptides and HS mimetics, synthetic xylosides, and heparinase inhibitors, and shown promising anti-cancer efficacy. Therefore, much progress has been made in this line of study. However, it needs to bear in mind that the roles of HSPGs in cancer can be either oncogenic or tumor-suppressive, depending on the HSPG and the cancer cell type with the underlying mechanisms that remain obscure. Further studies need to address these to fill the knowledge gap and rationalize more efficient therapeutic targeting.","ObjectiveTo facilitate immunotherapy and prognostic assessment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we established a novel immunogenomic classification to provide valid identification criteria.MethodsThe immune enrichment scores were calculated by single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and clustered into Immunity_L and Immunity_H, and the reliability of this classification was demonstrated. Immune microenvironment score and immune cell infiltration analysis of NSCLC were also performed. Randomly divided into training group and test group, a prognosis-related immune profile was developed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and stepwise COX proportional hazards model to construct a prognostic mode.ResultsThe risk score for this immune profile was identified as an independent prognostic factor and can be used as a powerful prognostic tool to refine tumor immunotherapy. Our study identified two NSCLC classifications based on immunomic profiling, Immunity_H and Immunity_L.ConclusionIn conclusion, Immunogenomic classification can distinguish the immune status of different types of NSCLC patients and contribute to the immunotherapy of NSCLC patients.",0
"BackgroundG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to have an important role in tumor development and metastasis, and abnormal expression of GPCRs is significantly associated with poor prognosis of tumor patients. In this study, we analyzed the GPCRs-related gene (GPRGs) and tumor microenvironment (TME) in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) to construct a prognostic model to help SKCM patients obtain accurate clinical treatment strategies.MethodsSKCM expression data and clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Differential expression analysis, LASSO algorithm, and univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were used to screen prognosis-related genes (GPR19, GPR146, S1PR2, PTH1R, ADGRE5, CXCR3, GPR143, and OR2I1P) and multiple prognosis-good immune cells; the data set was analyzed according to above results and build up a GPR-TME classifier. The model was further subjected to immune infiltration, functional enrichment, tumor mutational load, immunotherapy prediction, and scRNA-seq data analysis. Finally, cellular experiments were conducted to validate the functionality of the key gene GPR19 in the model.ResultsThe findings indicate that high expression of GPRGs is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with SKCM, highlighting the significant role of GPRGs and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in SKCM development. Notably, the group characterized by low GPR expression and a high TME exhibited the most favorable prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, cellular assays demonstrated that knockdown of GPR19 significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of melanoma cells in A375 and A2058 cell lines.ConclusionThis study provides novel insights for the prognosis evaluation and treatment of melanoma, along with the identification of a new biomarker, GPR19.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05486-4.","Cervical Cancer prevention is a relatively new concept in Medicine. Since mid-twentieth century, diagnosis of Precancerous phase became possible thus outcome of invasive cervical cancer could be avoided. The dawn of this new era began with the research on HPV infection, being the causative factor. Clinical use of vaccines made it possible to start primary prevention by the year 2006. There has been a paradigm shift in this field and some of the important shifts will be discussed. The 1st paradigm is to better understand “Cancer Prevention”. Cytology or the “Pap Smear” as it is commonly known is a simple low cost, low technology test. Combining it with biomarker test gives it more validity. Angiogenesis of cervical neoplasia was based on colposcopy. Angiogenesis inhibitor was discovered on this concept which improved treatment results. Incidence and mortality of cervical cancer shows a global disparity. For this, we have to study the social determinants. Some of the causes leading to high mortality are delay in diagnosis and reaching healthcare facility. UN’s SD goal has suggested 30% reduction to be achieved. HPV is the cause of many other cancers apart from cervical cancer which may lead to suffering and mortality. The most deadly genotypes of HPV are 9 which form the NONAVALENT Vaccine. Introduction of vaccine made in India may be a game changer. A new “Ray of Hope” was the introduction of therapeutic vaccines in 2020. It will reduce human suffering and prolong life. As research advances, many more new Paradigms will evolve.",0
"Lung Cancer remains a significant health concern, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic avenues due to the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current treatments. In this study, we utilized a thorough in-silico and in-vitro methodology to develop prospective drugs for the treatment of lung cancer. The active components of Citrus latifolia were identified through the utilization of a variety of pharmacological instruments, such as Gene Ontology, GeneCards, DrugBank, the Chinese Traditional Drug Database, and GeneMANIA. Subsequent molecular docking studies using GOLD software revealed Hesperidin as the most promising candidate, exhibiting a remarkable binding affinity (GOLD score: 60.98 kcal/mol) towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a pivotal target in lung cancer therapy. Further validation through Schrodinger-Glide redocking reaffirmed the robust interaction between Hesperidin and EGFR. Pharmacokinetic profiling of top-scoring ligands indicated favorable drug-like properties, supporting their therapeutic potential. Molecular dynamics simulations employing Desmond software demonstrated the structural stability and persistence of the Hesperidin-EGFR complex over a 100-ns trajectory, corroborating its efficacy. Additionally, cytotoxicity analysis revealed a potent inhibitory effect of Hesperidin with an IC50 value of 34.25 µg/ml. Collectively, our findings underscore Hesperidin from Citrus latifolia as a promising candidate for lung cancer therapy, warranting further investigation through in-vivo studies for clinical translation.Graphical Abstract","BackgroundDespite great advances in its early diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer is still an intractable disease and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and morbidity in the world. The family of Polo-like kinases (PLKs) consists of five serine/threonine kinases, which have been reported to participate in various human diseases. However, the expression and prognostic value of each PLK in human lung cancer have not been fully understood. This study analyzed mRNA expression and prognostic value of different PLKs in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsFirst, mRNA expression of PLKs in patients with NSCLC from the Oncomine and the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database was investigated. Then, a Kaplan–Meier plotter was employed for survival analysis. The sequence alteration for PLKs was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the cBioPortal database. Additionally, we analyzed the association among different PLKs using the LinkedOmics database. Finally, the enrichment analysis of PLKs was achieved using the DAVID database.ResultsThe mRNA expression levels of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly overexpressed, while mRNA expression level of PLK3 was underexpressed in patients with NSCLC. mRNA expressions of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly and positively related to the tumor stage of NSCLC. Increased expressions of PLK1, PLK4, and PLK5 and decreased expression of PLK2 were attributed to limited overall survival time in NSCLC. PLK1 was positively correlated with PLK4 via the LinkedOmics database.ConclusionsPLKs are relevant targets for NSCLC treatment, especially PLK1 and PLK4.",1
"Introduction:Glioblastoma patients have a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and systemic immunosuppression that comprise a major barrier to immune checkpoint therapy. Based on the production of endocannabinoids by glioblastomas, we explored involvement of endocannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), encoded by the CNR2 gene, which is predominantly expressed by immune cells, in glioblastoma-related immunosuppression.Materials & Methods:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases was used to correlate enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, as well as CB2Rs, with patient overall survival. Intrastriatal administration of luciferase-expressing, murine GL261 glioblastoma cells was used to establish in in vivo glioblastoma model for characterization of tumor growth and intratumoral immune cell infiltration, as well as provide immune cells for in vitro co-culture experiments. Involvement of CB2Rs was determined by treatment with CB2R agonist (GW405833) or CB2R antagonist (AM630). ELISA, FACS, and immunocytochemistry were used to determine perforin, granzyme B, and surface marker levels.Results:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases showed high expression of CB2R and elevated endocannabinoid production correlated with poorer prognosis, and involved immune-associated pathways. AM630treatment of GL261 glioblastoma-bearing mice induced a potent antitumor response, with survival plateauing at 50% on Day 40, when all control mice (median survival 28 days) and mice treated with GW405833 (median survival 21 days) had died. Luciferase tumor imaging revealed accelerated tumor growth by GW405833 treatment, but stable or regressing tumors in AM630-treated mice. Notably, in spleens, AM630 treatment caused an 83% decrease in monocytes/macrophages, and 1.8- and 1.6-fold increases in CD8+ and CD4+ cells, respectively. Within tumors, there was a corresponding decrease in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increase in CD8+ T cells. In vitro, lymphocytes from AM630-treated mice showed greater cytotoxic function (increased percentage of perforin- and granzyme B-positive CD8+ T cells).Discussion:These results suggest that inhibition of CB2R enhances both immunosuppressive TAM infiltration and systemic T-cell suppression through CB2R activation, and that inhibition of CB2Rs can potently counter both the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, as well as systemic immunosuppression in glioblastoma.","AbstractHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most prevalent and dangerous cancers in the world, which is associated with hepatitis and fibrosis resulting from different etiologies, such as hepatitis B and C virus, alcohol and diabetes. Chronic inflammation is suggested to promote tumorigenesis and progression by producing inflammatory cytokines and free radicals, triggering malignant transformation of cells, promoting tumor cells proliferation and inducing tumor angiogenesis. Immunosuppressive microenvironment established in the liver also plays a vital role in HCC development. The mechanisms include activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts, upregulation of pattern recognition receptors, inhibition of effector T cells, recruitment of regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, activation of hepatic stellate cells and immunosuppressive M2 macrophages. In this review, we will summarize the most recent studies and discuss the advanced mechanisms of chronic inflammatory microenvironment and immunosuppressive microenvironment promoting HCC development, aiming to explore potential therapeutic targets.",1
"AbstractDespite standard-of-care therapy, pediatric brain tumors are now the leading cause of cancer-related death in children, highlighting an urgent need for the development of new treatments. Immunotherapy is actively being evaluated as a therapeutic approach to pediatric brain tumors, however, more research is needed to reveal additional antigenic targets that exist in these malignancies. In this study, our team performed a transcriptomic analysis of pediatric brain tumor RNA sequencing data within the Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) to identify intra and extracellular antigens that are highly expressed across major tumor types. Interestingly, our team observed that most tumors had high gene expression of a group of antigens that were unique to that specific tumor type. Specifically, our analysis revealed that diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) highly expressed the extracellular antigens CA9, CTCFL, and ST8SIA1, whereas atypical rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) highly expressed MUC1 and TEK. Other tumors that displayed high gene expression for a variety of antigenic targets included H3-wildtype high-grade gliomas (HGGs), and ependymomas (EPNs). Strikingly, we observed minimal difference in antigen expression in primary tumors when compared to patient-matched recurrences. Beyond antigen expression, we evaluated the expression of antigen processing machinery (APM) which includes major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Our findings revealed that DMGs had the lowest level of APM expression, however, these tumors uniquely expressed high levels of the immune checkpoints ADORA2A, CD276, and KLRC1. Contrarily, ATRTs showed a high expression of immune checkpoints CD274 (PD-L1), PVR, and CD80. Other tumors included in our analysis had unique expression patterns of antigen, as well as APM and immune checkpoints. Our findings illustrate that pediatric brain tumors have distinct expression patterns of antigens, APM, and immune checkpoints that are specific to tumor type, emphasizing diverse, rather than general, immunotherapeutic approaches must be considered for childhood brain tumors.","PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of main tumor resection on long-term survival compared with pleural biopsy alone in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were intraoperatively diagnosed with pleural metastasis.Materials and MethodsA total of 176 patients with adenocarcinoma who had unexpected pleural metastasis detected during surgery from 2002 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Each surgeon decided whether to perform main tumor resection or pleural biopsy alone.ResultsThe patients were grouped based on the surgical approaches: main tumor resection (resection group; n=83) and pleural biopsy only (O&C group; n=93). The resection group had better overall survival (OS; 10-year survival, 27.9% vs. 9.4%; median survival, 68.3 vs. 36.6 months; p < 0.01) and locoregional progression-free survival (10-year survival, 12.5% vs. 7.1%; median survival, 19.6 vs. 10.6 months; p < 0.01) than the O&C group. Similar results were found for OS in patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line therapy (10-year survival, 49.2% vs. 15.0%; median survival, 72.2 vs. 45.4 months; p=0.03), patients who did not undergo TKIs treatment (10-year survival, 29.4% vs. 9.2%; median survival, 82.4 vs. 23.8 months; p < 0.01), and patients with positive target gene mutation (10-year survival, 31.7% vs. 10.1%; median survival, 72.2 vs. 33.7 months; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, pleural biopsy only (hazard ratio, 1.73; p=0.04) was a significant predictor of OS.ConclusionMain tumor resection can improve survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who had unexpected pleural metastasis during operation.",0
"Oral cancer accounts for around 30 percent of all cancers in India. These cancers are usually managed either by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these modalities. Dental oncologists play an integral part in the multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists, nurses, physician assistants, nutritionists, psychologists and social workers to efficiently manage cancer patients. Oral complications associated with cancer therapy can range from minor mucositis or infections to severely debilitating conditions such as osteonecrosis of jaws, which can disrupt the ongoing cancer therapy and jeopardize the overall quality of life of the patient. This highlights the primary role of a dentist in the efficient identification and management of potential oral foci of infection and subsequent prevention of the onset of these complications. This necessitates accurate, evidence-based knowledge and extensive training of dental oncologists to provide state-of-the-art management strategies. This article aims to review oral management before, during and after therapy in patients undergoing treatment for cancers affecting the head and neck region.","PurposeOral cancer is a significant global health concern, with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in regions with prevalent tobacco usage such as Asia. Majority of oral cancers are detected at an advanced stage resulting in poor survival outcomes. Moreover, the treatment modalities of oral cancers have remained constant with surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy being mainstays of the treatment. This review provides a significant progress made in understanding the molecular landscape of oral cancers and the evolution of therapeutic strategies toward precision medicine.MethodsA comprehensive literature review was conducted to gather recent studies on the molecular landscape of oral cancers, genomic insights, and clinical trials.ResultsFirstly, genomic insights into oral cancers, including key driver mutations and copy number alterations, are discussed in the context of personalized medicine approaches. Subsequently, advancements in therapeutic strategies, particularly focusing on clinical trials investigating immunotherapy and targeted agents, are highlighted.ConclusionDespite promising results, challenges persist in identifying reliable biomarkers for treatment response and resistance. Continued research efforts are warranted to validate biomarkers and optimize therapeutic interventions, with the goal of enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of oral cancer.",1
"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pCRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the accepted standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The purpose of pCRT is to prevent the spread of viable tumor cells within the local area during surgical procedures. Additionally, pCRT can facilitate the resection of locally advanced tumors that are otherwise challenging to remove, thereby enabling a radical resection. Although a pathologic complete response is observed in fewer than 20% of patients, the reasons for the variability in tumor response to pCRT are not fully understood. Several techniques have been researched with the aim of improving the tumor response to pCRT. These techniques include intensifying or combining chemotherapy, either simultaneously or sequentially, increasing radiation dose, modifying radiation mode or schedule, adjusting the interval between radiation and surgery, and incorporating multiple agents to increase the efficacy of pCRT. This review discusses various strategies that may improve tumor response outcomes following pCRT.","P2 purinergic receptor expression is dysregulated in multiple cancer subtypes and is associated with worse outcomes. Studies identify roles for P2 purinergic receptors in tumor cells that drive disease aggressiveness. There is also sufficient evidence that P2 purinergic receptor expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for disease initiation and progression. Immune cells constitute a significant component of the TME and display both tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic potential. Studies pre-dating the investigation of P2 purinergic receptors in cancer identify P2 receptor expression on multiple immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, T-cells, and dendritic cells; all of which are implicated in tumor initiation, tumor promotion, or response to treatment. Herein, we discuss P2 purinergic receptor expression and function in tumor-related immune cells. We provide a rationale for further investigations of P2 purinergic receptors within the TME to better define the mechanistic pathways of inflammation-mediate tumorigenesis and explore P2 purinergic receptors as potential targets for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.",0
"Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen‐presenting cells involved in promoting and controlling immune responses. Different subsets of DC, named tolerogenic (tol)DC, play a critical role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and in fostering tolerance. These unique skills make tolDC especially attractive for strategies aimed at re‐establishing/inducing tolerance in immune‐mediated conditions. The generation of potent tolDC in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes has seen remarkable advancements. TolDC modulate T cell dynamics by favoring regulatory T cells (Tregs) and curbing effector/pathogenic T cells. Among the several methods developed for in vitro tolDC generation, IL‐10 conditioning has been proven to be the most efficient, as IL‐10‐modulated tolDC were demonstrated to promote Tregs with the strongest suppressive activities. Investigating the molecular, metabolic, and functional profiles of tolDC uncovers essential pathways that facilitate their immunoregulatory functions. This Review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of tolDC in health and disease, focusing on IL‐10 production, functional characterization of in vitro generated tolDC, molecular and metabolic changes occurring in tolDC induced by tolerogenic agents, clinical applications of tolDC‐based therapy, and finally new perspectives in the generation of effective tolDC.","Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) refers to a broad spectrum of conditions associating fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis) with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and potentially cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). The first stages of these diseases are reversible and the immune system, together with metabolic factors (obesity, insulin resistance, Western diet, etc.), can influence the disease trajectory leading to progression or regression. Dendritic cells are professional antigen‐presenting cells that constantly sense environmental stimuli and orchestrate immune responses. Herein, we discuss the existing literature on the heterogeneity of dendritic cell lineages, states, and functions, to provide a comprehensive overview of how liver dendritic cells influence the onset and evolution of MASLD.",1
"AbstractCentral to immune recognition is the glycocalyx, a glycan-rich coat on all cells that plays a crucial role in interactions that enable pathogen detection and activation of immune defenses. Pathogens and cancerous cells often display distinct glycans on their surfaces, making these saccharide antigens prime targets for vaccine development. However, carbohydrates alone generally serve as poor immunogens due to their often weak binding affinities, inability to effectively recruit T cell help, and reliance on adjuvants to iboost immune activation. The introduction of glycoconjugate vaccines, initially involving the covalent coupling of carbohydrate antigens to carrier proteins, marked a pivotal advancement by facilitating neutralizing antibody production against carbohydrate targets. Despite successes in generating glycoconjugate vaccines against certain bacterial diseases, challenges persist in creating effective vaccines against numerous intracellular pathogens and non-communicable diseases such as cancer. In this review, we highlight new developments in conjugate vaccine platforms aim to overcome these limitations by optimizing the display of glycan and T cell epitopes as well as incorporating defined carbohydrate adjuvants to direct tailored immune responses. These advancements promise to improve the effectiveness of carbohydrate-based vaccines and broaden their coverage against a wide range of diseases.",Graphical abstractThe graph was created with biorender.com (agreement number: BJ27LQOB7N).,0
"AbstractBackgroundGlutamine is an important nutrient for cancer cell growth that provides biological sources for nucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis, but the role of glutaminolysis in signal transduction and glioblastoma (GBM) progression remains little known.MethodsKnockdown and overexpression cells were obtained to explore the functional roles of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) in cell proliferation, tumor formation, and aerobic glycolysis. RNA-seq, Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase assay, and western blot were performed to verify the regulation of the EGFR-AKT pathway by the GDH1 (also known as GLUD1) and KDM6A. Metabolite-level measurements and Seahorse Assay were performed to assess the functional role of GHD1 in reprogramming glycolysis.ResultsHere, we report that GDH1 catalytic glutaminolysis is essential for GBM cell line proliferation and brain tumorigenesis even in high-glucose conditions. Glutamine is metabolized through glutaminolysis to produce α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). We demonstrate that glutamine in combination with leucine activates mammalian TORC1 by enhancing glutaminolysis and α-KG production. α-KG increases the transcription of PDPK1 by reducing the suppressive histone modification H3K27me3 and then promotes the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This transcriptional activation induced by α-KG requires histone demethylase KDM6A, which is a 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase that plays an important role in converting α-KG to succinate. Furthermore, we show that GDH1-catalytic glutaminolysis also increases the expression of HK2 and promotes glycolysis in high-glucose conditions dependent on KDM6A-mediated demethylation of H3K27.ConclusionsThese findings suggest a novel function of glutaminolysis in the regulation of signal transduction and metabolism reprogramming and provide further evidence for the unique role of glutaminolysis in GBM progression.","AbstractBackgroundGlutamine is an important nutrient for cancer cell growth that provides biological sources for nucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis, but the role of glutaminolysis in signal transduction and glioblastoma (GBM) progression remains little known.MethodsKnockdown and overexpression cells were obtained to explore the functional roles of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) in cell proliferation, tumor formation, and aerobic glycolysis.

"Although deubiquitinases (DUBs) have been well described in liver tumorigenesis, their potential roles and mechanisms have not been fully understood. In this study, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) as an oncogene with essential roles during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. USP1, with elevated expression levels and clinical significance, was identified as a hub DUB for HCC in multiple bioinformatics datasets. Functionally, USP1 overexpression significantly enhanced the malignant behaviors in HCC cell lines and spheroids in vitro, as well as the zebrafish model and the xenograft model in vivo. In contrast, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP1 dramatically impaired the phenotypes of HCC cells. Specifically, ectopic USP1 enhanced aggressive properties and metabolic reprogramming of HCC cells by modulating mitochondrial dynamics. Mechanistically, USP1 induced mitochondrial fission by enhancing phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 via deubiquitination and stabilization of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which could be degraded by the E3 ligase NEDD4L. The USP1/CDK5 modulatory axis was activated in HCC tissues, which was correlated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, Prasugrel was identified as a candidate USP1 inhibitor for targeting the phenotypes of HCC by an extensive computational study combined with experimental validations. Taken together, USP1 induced malignant phenotypes and metabolic reprogramming by modulating mitochondrial dynamics in a CDK5-mediated Drp1 phosphorylation manner, thereby deteriorating HCC progression.","The pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is an essential component of the activation of the necroptotic pathway. Emerging evidence suggests that MLKL plays a key role in liver disease. However, how MLKL contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we report that MLKL is upregulated in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced murine HCC model and is associated with human hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocyte-specific MLKL knockout suppresses the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis. Conversely, MLKL overexpression aggravates the initiation and progression of DEN-induced HCC. Mechanistic study reveals that deletion of MLKL significantly increases the activation of autophagy, thereby protecting against hepatocarcinogenesis. MLKL directly interacts with AMPKα1 and inhibits its activity independent of its necroptotic function. Mechanistically, MLKL serves as a bridging molecule between AMPKα1 and protein phosphatase 1B (PPM1B), thus enhancing the dephosphorylation of AMPKα1. Consistently, MLKL expression correlates negatively with AMPKα1 phosphorylation in HCC patients. Taken together, our findings highlight MLKL as a novel AMPK gatekeeper that plays key roles in inhibiting autophagy and driving hepatocarcinogenesis, suggesting that the MLKL-AMPKα1 axis is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.",1
"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been associated with susceptibility and protection against a number of cancers. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to evaluate the overall influence of 127 HLA Class I and II alleles on 30 types of cancer. We found a preponderance of protective alleles (negatively correlated with cancer prevalences), especially for HLA Class I. Of the 30 cancers investigated, 13 were associated with mostly protective HLA effects whereas only 2 were associated with mostly susceptibility HLA alleles. Taken together, these findings highlight the broad influence of HLA on cancer and the complexity of HLA-cancer associations.","PurposeTo describe long-term prescribed drug use after rectal cancer treatment.MethodsWe identified 12,871 rectal cancer patients without distant metastasis between 2005 and 2016 and 64,341 matched population comparators using CRCBaSe (a Swedish nationwide register linkage of colorectal cancer patients). Mean defined daily doses (DDDs) of drug dispensing during relapse-free follow-up were calculated by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical drug categories. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from negative binomial regression were used to compare drug dispensing between patients and comparators.ResultsThe overall pattern of drug dispensing was similar among cancer survivors and comparators, although patients had higher mean DDDs of drugs regulating the digestive system. Excess dispensing of drugs for constipation (IRR, 3.35; 95% CI, 3.12–3.61), diarrhea (IRR, 6.43; 95% CI, 5.72–7.22), functional gastrointestinal disorders (IRR, 3.78; 95% CI, 3.15–4.54), and vitamin and mineral supplements (IRR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.24–1.50) was observed up to 10 years after surgery. Treatment with Hartmann’s procedure was associated with higher dispensing rates of digestive drugs compared to surgery with anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection but the association was attributed to higher use of diabetic drugs. Additionally, excess digestive drug dispensing was associated with more advanced cancer stage but not with (chemo)radiotherapy treatment.ConclusionsExcess drug use after rectal cancer is primarily driven by bowel-regulating drugs and is not modified by surgical or oncological treatment.Implications for Cancer SurvivorsThe excess use of bowel-regulating drugs after rectal cancer indicated long-standing postsurgical gastrointestinal morbidity and need of prophylaxis. Reassuringly, no excess use of other drug classes was noted long term.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11764-024-01548-9.",1
"BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. The progression of numerous malignancies has been linked to abnormal vesicle-mediated transport-related gene (VMTRG) expression. The prognostic importance of VMTRGs in HCC is uncertain nonetheless.MethodsUtilizing HCC data from TCGA and ICGC, we employed univariate cox analysis, unsupervised clustering, and lasso analysis to construct molecular subtypes and prognostic signature of HCC based on the prognostic-associated VMTRGs expression levels. Subsequently, we validated the expression levels of the signature genes. We investigated the probable pathways using gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Six methods were utilized to compare immune cell infiltration between two risk groups. Moreover, the “pRRophetic” algorithm was utilized to test the drug sensitivity of both groups.ResultsWe identified two distinct subtypes with divergent biological behaviors and immune functionality through unsupervised clustering. Subtype C1 demonstrated a poorer prognosis. A prognostic signature incorporating two VMTRGs (KIF2C and RAC1) was formulated. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analyses unveiled a significant upregulation of these pivotal genes within HCC tissues. The prognosis was worse for the high-risk group, which also had a higher clinicopathological grade, higher levels of tumor mutation burden (TMB), a higher immunological infiltration of CD8 + T cells, a higher expression of immune checkpoints, and enhanced immunotherapy efficacy. These two risk groups also have varied chemotherapy drug sensitivities.ConclusionsBased on VMTRGs, we have developed a signature that assists in accurate prognosis prediction and formulating personalized treatment strategies for HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05079-1.","AbstractBackgroundGlioma, characterized by limited lymphocytic infiltration, constitutes an “immune-desert” tumor displaying insensitivity to various immunotherapies. This study aims to explore therapeutic strategies for inducing tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation within the glioma microenvironment (GME) to transition it from an immune resistant to an activated state.MethodsTLS formation in GME was successfully induced by intracranial administration of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (OK-432, TLR2/4/9 agonist) and glioma antigens (i.c. αTLR-mix). We employed staining analysis, antibody neutralization, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), and BCR/TCR sequencing to investigate the underlying mechanisms of TLS formation and its role in anti-glioma immunity. Additionally, a preliminary translational clinical study was conducted.ResultsTLS formation correlated with increased lymphocyte infiltration in GME and led to improved prognosis in glioma-bearing mice. In the study of TLS induction mechanisms, certain macrophages/microglia and Th17 displayed markers of “LTo” and “LTi” cells, respectively, interaction through LTα/β-LTβR promoted TLS induction. Post-TLS formation, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells but not CD19 + B cells contributed to anti-glioma immunity. Comparative analysis of B/T cells between brain and lymph node showed that brain B/T cells unveiled the switch from naïve to mature, some B cells highlighted an enrichment of class switch recombination (CSR)-associated genes, V gene usage, and clonotype bias were observed. In related clinical studies, i.c. αTLR-mix treatment exhibited tolerability, and chemokines/cytokines assay provided preliminary evidence supporting TLS formation in GME.ConclusionsTLS induction in GME enhanced anti-glioma immunity, improved the immune microenvironment, and controlled glioma growth, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for treating glioma in the future.",0
"Purpose The efficacy and lower neurotoxicity of normal brain-sparing radiotherapy (NBS-RT) with systemic therapy in treating multiple brain metastases from non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is underexplored. This study compares whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and NBS-RT for multiple brain metastases in NSCLC, focusing on treatment outcomes and leukoencephalopathy.Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 503 patients with NSCLC with multiple brain metastases at a single center, treated with either WBRT or NBS-RT. Post-RT treatments included chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Main outcomes measured were intracranial control, overall survival (OS), and leukoencephalopathy incidence.Results In this study, 441 patients received WBRT and 62 received NBS-RT, with median ages of 62 and 61 years, respectively. A significant portion of both groups, 77.3% in WBRT and 80.6% in NBS-RT, received post-RT systemic therapy. The median number of brain metastases was 10 for WBRT and 12 for NBS-RT, with median maximal diameters of 11.7 mm in WBRT and 14.4 mm in NBS-RT. After a median follow-up of 10.9 months for WBRT and 11.8 months for NBS-RT, there were no significant differences in intracranial progression (p=0.516) or OS (p=0.492) between the groups. However, WBRT patients had a higher incidence of leukoencephalopathy than NBS-RT patients (p=0.013).Conclusion NBS-RT combined with systemic therapy was as effective in treating multiple brain metastases as WBRT and was less toxic. NBS-RT-based strategies deserve further investigation in a prospective setting.","AbstractBackgroundMSA-2, as an oral molecule for activating STING signaling pathway to cure the tumor entering clinical trials. The toxicity of MSA-2 has aroused wide concern, especially the reproductive toxicity can not be ignored.ObjectivesWe synthesized the STING agonist (MSA-2) and its derivative manganese-MSA-2 (MSA-2-Mn) and investigated the reproductive toxicity.MethodsWe evaluated the reproductive effects of MSA-2 and MSA-2-Mn in female mice under the administration alone and on the reproductive system of male mice in the presence or absence of combined radiation.ResultsResults suggested that MSA-2 and MSA-2-Mn have negligible reproductive toxicity in healthy adults. Conclusions: This provides new ideas to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, as well as favorable evidence for future systemic dosing in patients of reproductive age and clinical trials of immunotherapy.",0
"FGFR has been considered a crucial oncogenic driver and promising target for cancer therapy. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of 3-amino-N-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-methylpyrazine-2-carboxamide derivatives as novel FGFR inhibitors. SAR exploration led to the identification of 18i as a pan-FGFR inhibitor with favorable in vitro activity against FGFR1–4. Moreover, 18i blocked the activation of FGFR and downstream signaling pathways at the submicromolar level and exhibited potent antitumor activity in multiple cancer cell lines with FGFR abnormalities. Molecular docking was performed to investigate the possible binding modes of 18i within the binding site of FGFR2. These results suggest that compound 18i is a promising candidate for further drug discovery.","Objectives.To comprehensively investigate nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment, overall survival (OS), and the influence of clinical/sociodemographic factors on outcome.Study Design.Retrospective database study.Setting.National Cancer Database.Methods.The 2004–2015 National Cancer Database was queried for all patients with NPC receiving definitive treatment. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were used for statistical analyses.Results.A total of 8260 patients with NPC were included (71.4% male; 42.5% with keratinizing histology; mean ± SD age, 52.1 ± 15.1 years), with a 5-year OS of 63.4%. Multivariate predictors of mortality included age ≥65 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81; P < .001), Charlson/Deyo score ≥1 (HR, 1.27; P = .001), American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical stage III to IV (HR, 1.85; P < .001), and government insurance or no insurance (HR, 1.53; P < .001). Predictors of survival included female sex (HR, 0.82; P = .002), Asian/Pacific Islander race (HR, 0.74; P <.001), nonkeratinizing/undifferentiated histology (HR, 0.79; P = .004), and receiving treatment at academic centers (HR, 0.87; P = .02). Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) demonstrated improved OS as compared with radiotherapy (RT) only for stage II (P = .006) and stage III (P = .005) and with RT or chemotherapy only in stage IVA NPC (P < .001). When compared with CRT alone, surgery plus CRT provided OS benefits in keratinizing (P = .013) or stage IVA (P = .030) NPC. When compared with RT, CRT provided OS benefits in keratinizing (P = .005) but not nonkeratinizing (P = .240) or undifferentiated (P = .390) NPC. Substandard radiation dosing of <60 Gy and <30 fractions were associated with inferior OS (both P <.001).Conclusions.NPC survival is dependent on a variety of clinical/sociodemographic factors. Stage-specific treatments with optimal OS include CRT or RT for stages I to II and CRT for stage III to IV. The large representation of nonendemic histology is valuable, as these cases are not well characterized.",0
"Gastric cancer is still a major cancer worldwide. The early diagnosis rate of gastric cancer in most high incidence countries is low. At present, the overall treatment effect of gastric cancer is poor, and the median overall survival remains low. Most of the patients with gastric cancer are in an advanced stage when diagnosed, and drug treatment has become the main means. Thus, new targeted drugs and therapeutic strategies are the hope of improving the therapeutic effect of gastric cancer. In this review, we summarize the new methods and advances of targeted therapy for gastric cancer, including novel molecular targeted therapeutic agents and drug delivery systems, with a major focus on the development of drug delivery systems (drug carriers and targeting peptides). Elaborating these new methods and advances will contribute to the management of gastric cancer.","Brain tumors such as glioblastomas are resistant to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, largely due to limited T cell infiltration in the tumors. Here, we show that mice bearing intracranial tumors exhibit systemic immunosuppression and T cell sequestration in bone marrow, leading to reduced T cell infiltration in brain tumors. Elevated plasma corticosterone drives the T cell sequestration via glucocorticoid receptors in tumor-bearing mice. Immunosuppression mediated by glucocorticoid-induced T cell dynamics and the subsequent tumor growth promotion can be abrogated by adrenalectomy, the administration of glucocorticoid activation inhibitors or glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, and in mice with T cell-specific deletion of glucocorticoid receptor. CCR8 expression in T cells is increased in tumor-bearing mice in a glucocorticoid receptor-dependent manner. Additionally, chemokines CCL1 and CCL8, the ligands for CCR8, are highly expressed in bone marrow immune cells in tumor-bearing mice to recruit T cells. These findings suggested that brain tumor-induced glucocorticoid surge and CCR8 upregulation in T cells lead to T cell sequestration in bone marrow, impairing the anti-tumor immune response. Targeting the glucocorticoid receptor-CCR8 axis may offer a promising immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of intracranial tumors.",0
"We describe diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in this rare entity of CD20-negative B cell lymphomas. They comprise only 1 to 2% of all B cell lymphoma with four subcategories. However, with an increasing understanding of these cases, novel entities have been recognized. Workup, treatment, and follow-up of two CD20-negative B cell lymphoma cases, including a novel entity, have been described. A novel case of triple expresser CD20-negative B cell lymphoma and plasmablastic lymphoma has been diagnosed. The absence of CD20 leads to the abolishment of the targeted drug (rituximab) from the treatment regimen. These cases render the importance of extensive immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization workup for diagnosis of this rare entity. Treatment also remains a challenge as immunotherapy with CD20-targeted drugs cannot be given.","AbstractApigenin, a potent natural flavonoid, has emerged as a key therapeutic agent due to its multifaceted medicinal properties in combating various diseases. However, apigenin's clinical utility is greatly limited by its poor water solubility, low bioavailability and stability issues. To address these challenges, this review paper explores the innovative field of nanotechnology-based delivery systems, which have shown significant promise in improving the delivery and effectiveness of apigenin. This paper also explores the synergistic potential of co-delivering apigenin with conventional therapeutic agents. Despite the advantageous properties of these nanoformulations, critical challenges such as scalable production, regulatory approvals and comprehensive long-term safety assessments remain key hurdles in their clinical adoption which must be addressed for commercialization of apigenin-based formulations.",0
"TCF1high progenitor CD8+ T cells mediate the efficacy of immunotherapy, however the mechanisms that govern their generation and maintenance are poorly understood. Here, we show that targeting glycolysis through deletion of pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2) results in elevated pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity, leading to enrichment of a TCF1high progenitor exhausted-like phenotype and increased responsiveness to PD-1 blockade in vivo. PKM2KO CD8+ T cells showed reduced glycolytic flux, accumulation of glycolytic intermediates and PPP metabolites, and increased PPP cycling as determined by 1,2 13C glucose carbon tracing. Small molecule agonism of the PPP without acute glycolytic impairment skewed CD8+ T cells towards a TCF1high population, generated a unique transcriptional landscape, and adoptive transfer of agonist-treated CD8+ T cells enhanced tumor control in mice in combination with PD-1 blockade, and promoted tumor killing in patient-derived tumor organoids. Our study demonstrates a new metabolic reprogramming that contributes to a progenitor-like T cell state promoting immunotherapy efficacy.","Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer (PC). Tryptophan oxidative catabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) cleaves the indole ring to kynurenine (Kyn), an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which activates multiple tumorigenesis pathways. The IDO1-Kyn-AhR axis is aberrantly dysregulated in mCRPC. (−)-Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid. CBD showed antitumor activities against human malignancies, including PC. CBD showed potent in vitro dose-dependent reduction of viability and clonogenicity of diverse human PC cell lines. CBD reduced the expression of IDO1 and AhR in PC cells. A daily 15 mg/kg oral dose of CBD for 30 days effectively suppressed the progression of the mCRPC CWR-R1ca-Luc cells xenografted in male nude mice. Continued CBD oral dosing for an additional 45 days suppressed the CWR-R1ca-Luc tumor locoregional and distant recurrences after the primary tumors’ surgical excision. Collected CBD-treated tumors showed a reduced level of IDO1 expression. CBD-treated mice displayed a significant systemic reduction of Kyn. CBD is a novel, nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid lead useful for the control of mCRPC via targeting the tryptophan catabolism.",0
"BackgroundDisulfidptosis, as a new mode of programmed cell death, is closely associated with tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, M2 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) plays an important role in tumor progression. Here, we propose to combine these two perspectives to detect novel disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related biomarkers in bladder cancer (BCa) to identify various tumor subtypes, construct prognostic features, reveal immune and somatic mutational landscapes, and screen for drugs in BCa.MethodsWe used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to mine M2 TAM-related genes. Consensus unsupervised clustering was performed to identify potential tumor subtypes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to build the risk model. We then explored the immune cell, immune function, immune checkpoint expression patterns and somatic mutational landscape in clusters and risk groups. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis for anti-cancer drugs.ResultsWe identified 3057 M2 TAM-related genes and intersected them with disulfidptosis-related genes to obtain 95 disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related genes (DMRGs). In terms of tumor subtypes, two molecular clusters were identified. Cluster 1 showed stronger immunogenicity and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). We also predicted 50 drugs with high sensitivity in cluster 1. On the basis of risk grouping, the high-risk group had poor overall survival in the training, test, and validation groups. Ten screened anti-cancer drugs were more sensitive in the high-risk group. A nomogram predicting survival of BCa patients was also established.ConclusionBy combining two hotspot perspectives, disulfidptosis and M2 TAM, we provide a valuable risk score signature for establishing individualized treatment regimens and drug choices. The risk score may serve as an independent risk factor for BCa patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05352-3.","PurposeThis study aimed to investigate whether N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related long non-coding RNAs (m6ARelncRNAs) could provide novel tools to predict overall survival of renal clear cell carcinoma.MethodsThe transcriptomic data and clinical information of patients with renal clear cell carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed. Distinct m6A modification patterns were systemically analysed via consensus clustering analysis. An m6ARelncRNA signature was constructed in the training cohort using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis and validated in the test cohort. Potential predictive accuracy of the signature was further assessed via Kaplan–Meier survival, univariate and multivariate Cox regression and subgroup analyses. The Tumour Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm was used to investigate the role of m6ARelncRNAs in guiding immunotherapy for patients with renal carcinoma.ResultsAn m6ARelncRNA signature based on only six lncRNAs was successfully constructed. The high-risk group derived from this signature had significantly poorer overall survival in both training and test cohorts (p < 0.001). Independent prognostic analysis further revealed that m6ARelncRNA risk (p < 0.01) was an independent risk factor for survival outcomes of renal carcinoma. TIDE algorithm revealed that immunotherapy response was poorer in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity analysis based on IC50 revealed that high-risk patients were potentially sensitive to various anti-tumour drugs, including bortezomib, cisplatin, docetaxel, etoposide and sunitinib.Conclusionm6ARelncRNAs provide novel tools that can be used to predict overall survival and examine the immune microenvironment of renal clear cell carcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04389-0.",1
"AbstractBackgroundThis investigator-initiated phase II trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (CaboNivoIpi) in previously treated patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.MethodsEligible patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who progressed on 1 prior line of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy received a 2-week run-in of cabozantinib monotherapy followed by CaboNivoIpi for 4 cycles (cycle length = 6 weeks), followed by cabozantinib plus nivolumab (cycle length = 4 weeks) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) within the first 6 months of treatment. A Simon optimal 2-stage design allowed for an interim analysis after accrual of 10 evaluable patients. At least 5 responses were needed to proceed to stage 2.ResultsAmong 11 patients enrolled, the median age was 69 years. Prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapies included lenvatinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib plus everolimus. Median follow-up was 13.4 months. Among 10 evaluable patients, ORR within the first 6 months of treatment was 10% (1 partial response). Median progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI, 3.0–not reached) and median overall survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 4.6–not reached). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were noted in 55% (6/11) and grade 5 AEs in 18% (2/11) of patients. The most common treatment-related AE was hypertension. The study did not reach its prespecified efficacy threshold.ConclusionCaboNivoIpi had low ORRs and a high rate of grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs.Clinical Trial RegistrationNCT03914300","AbstractRationale:Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare tumor with a poor prognosis and has no recommended therapy after first-line pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on peritoneal mesothelioma remains to be elucidated. We herein report the case of a 75-year-old man with peritoneal mesothelioma treated with cisplatin plus pemetrexed and subsequent nivolumab.Patient concerns:A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to lower abdominal pain.Diagnosis:Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (CT) showed the accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in an intraperitoneal mass. A histological examination of a laparoscopic biopsy specimen revealed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.Interventions:After 4 cycles of cisplatin plus pemetrexed and 13 subsequent cycles of pemetrexed maintenance therapy showed beneficial responses until CT revealed liver metastasis. Nivolumab was then administered as the second-line therapy.Outcomes:After 3 cycles of biweekly nivolumab administration, he developed severe abdominal distention. CT revealed an intraperitoneal mass growing much more rapidly than ever, indicating hyperprogressive disease after nivolumab treatment. He ultimately died 51 days after the initial nivolumab administration.Lessons:To our knowledge, this is the first report of hyperprogressive disease in a case of peritoneal mesothelioma after nivolumab treatment. While immune checkpoint inhibitors may be promising therapeutic strategies for treating malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, careful monitoring must be practiced with their application.",1
"ABSTRACTObjectivesTo evaluate the effects of CALM intervention on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), and heart rate variability (HRV) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.MethodsA total of 153 NSCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to the CALM group and usual care (UC) group. Patients in the CALM group were received 6 CALM intervention sessions over a 12-week period and evaluated using CRF, QOL and HRV at baseline (T0) and after 2, 4, and 6 intervention sessions.ResultsThe CALM group showed significant differences in total CRF, behavioral/daily life CRF, emotional/affective CRF, sensory/physical CRF, cognitive CRF and QOL before and after CALM intervention sessions (F = 643.47, F = 208.34, F = 354.52, F = 285.69, F = 334.29, F = 245.77, p < 0.001). The CALM group showed significant increases in standard deviation of normal R-R interval (SDNN) and high-frequency power (HF) (z = −4.94, p < 0.001,z = −4.30, p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were observed between CRF and SDNN, HF and QOL across all participants.ConclusionsThe CALM intervention had a positive impact on overall physical and mental health, fatigue reduction, quality of life and autonomic dysfunction in NSCLC patients. Heart rate variability may serve as an observational indicator of physical and mental health.","Epithelial ovarian cancers that are non-homologous recombination deficient, as well as those that are recurrent and in a platinum-resistant state, have limited therapeutic options. The objectives of this study were to characterize the mechanism of action and investigate the therapeutic potential of a small molecule, VDX-111, against ovarian cancer. We examined the ability of VDX-111 to inhibit the growth of a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, focusing on BRCA wild-type lines. We found that VDX-111 causes a dose-dependent loss of cell viability across ovarian cancer cell lines. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis was used to identify changes in cell signaling in response to VDX-111 treatment. An RPPA analysis performed on cells treated with VDX-111 detected changes in cell signaling related to autophagy and necroptosis. Immunoblots of OVCAR3 and SNU8 cells confirmed a dose-dependent increase in LC3A/B and RIPK1. Incucyte live cell imaging was used to measure cell proliferation and death in response to VDX-111 alone and with inhibitors of apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy. Annexin/PI assays suggested predominantly non-apoptotic cell death, while real-time kinetic imaging of cell growth indicated the necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1, attenuates VDX-111-induced loss of cell viability, suggesting a necroptosis-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, VDX-111 inhibited tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft and syngeneic murine models. In conclusion, the cytotoxic effects of VDX-111 seen in vitro and in vivo appear to occur in a necroptosis-dependent manner and may promote an anti-tumor immune response.",0
"Rank aggregation (RA) is the process of consolidating disparate rankings into a single unified ranking. It holds immense potential in the field of genomics. RA has applications in diverse research areas, such as gene expression analysis, meta-analysis, gene prioritization, and biomarker discovery. However, there are many challenges in the application of the RA approach to biological data, such as dealing with heterogeneous data sources, rankings of mixed quality, and evaluating the consolidated rankings. In this review, we present an overview of the existing RA methods with an emphasis on those that have been tailored to the complexities of genomics research. These encompass a broad range of approaches, from distributional and heuristic methods to Bayesian and stochastic optimization algorithms. By examining these techniques, we aim to equip researchers with the background knowledge needed to navigate the intricacies of RA in genomics data integration effectively. We review the practical applications to highlight the relevance and impact of RA methods in advancing genomics research. As the field continues to evolve, we identify open problems and suggest future directions to enhance the effectiveness of rank aggregation in genomics, by addressing the challenges related to data heterogeneity, single-cell omics and spatial transcriptomics data, and the development of clear and consistent evaluation methods. In summary, RA stands as a powerful tool in genomics research, which can offer deeper insights and more comprehensive data integration solutions.","This article explores the development of T cell-based therapies in Switzerland. These therapies, which elicit the immunological potential of each patient to respond to tumor development, constitute a major promise for so-called ‘precision oncology’. We document how immunological concepts, technologies, and practices are articulated given the centrality of genomics in ‘precision oncology’. We consider ‘precision immunotherapies’ to probe whether and how change ensues in these established sociotechnical regimes of biomedicine. The case of genomics and immunology in oncology offers a unique insight into the conditions of possibility for change in such regimes. How does the present new wave of cancer immunotherapies challenge, integrate, and complement the centrality of genomics in ‘precision oncology’? What are the specific processes that make possible the convergence, competition, or co-existence of distinct conceptions, infrastructures, and programs of innovative cancer medicine? Drawing from observations and interviews with researchers and clinicians, we qualify these sociotechnical processes as hybridizations. Bringing together different sociotechnical regimes of biomedical research is conditional to the articulation of core concepts, technologies, and translational practices of genomics and immunology. Pivotal to this objective are neoantigens, cell surface proteins originating from the somatic genetic mutations of tumors and which activate a patient’s immune response. While neoantigens are an unstable entity in experimentation, they offer a conceptual and material substrate to renegotiate the dominance of cancer genomics, and initiate the production of a new, hybrid regime of ‘immunogenomic precision’ in oncology.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal human malignancy with a very low overall and long-term survival rate. Poor prognostic outcomes are predominantly associated with HCC due to a huge landscape of heterogeneity found in the deadliest disease. However, molecular subtyping of HCC has significantly improved the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that contribute towards the heterogeneity and progression of the disease. In this review, we have extensively summarized the current information available about molecular classification of HCC. This review can be of great significance for providing the insight information needed for development of novel, efficient and personalized therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC patients globally.","PurposeThe aim of our study was to evaluate, under real-life conditions, survival of patients with advanced HCC (BCLC-C), either initially presenting in that stage or migrating from BCLC-A to BCLC-C within 2 years after curative LR/RFA, treated either with Atezolizumab–Bevacizumab or TKIs.MethodsSixty-four cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC, who either initially presented as BCLC-C and were treated with Atezo–Bev (group A, N = 23) or TKIs (group B, N = 15) or who migrated from BCLC-A to BCLC-C stage within 2 years after LR/RFA and were either treated with Atezo–Bev (group C, N = 12) or TKIs (group D, N = 14), were retrospectively evaluated.ResultsThe four groups were comparable for all baseline parameters (demographics/platelets/liver disease etiology/diabetes/varices/Child–Pugh stage/ALBI grade) except for CPT score and MELD-Na. Using Cox-regression analysis, we observed that survival of group C after systemic treatment onset was significantly higher compared to group A (HR 3.71, 1.20–11.46, p = 0.02) and presented a trend to statistical significance when compared to group D (HR 3.14, 0.95–10.35, p = 0.06), adjusted for liver disease severity scores. When all BCLC-C patients classified as such due to PS only were excluded from the study, a trend for the same survival benefit in group C was shown, even in the most difficult-to-treat population with extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion.ConclusionCirrhotic patients with advanced HCC initially diagnosed in BCLC-C, exhibit the worst survival irrespective of treatment schedule, whereas patients progressing to BCLC-C following disease recurrence after LR/RFA, seem to mostly benefit from Atezo–Bev, even patients with extrahepatic disease and/or macrovascular invasion. Liver disease severity seems to drive survival of these patients.",1
"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy. PTEN is a negative regulator of PI3K signaling and is deficient in > 50% of primary human endometrial cancer. Amplification of ERBB2 promotes tumorigenesis and pathogenesis of several human cancers. However, the effect of ERBB2 targeting has not been studied in endometrial cancer with PTEN mutations. The murine model Pgrcre/+Erbb2f/fPtenf/f (Erbb2d/d Ptend/d) was developed to evaluate the effect of ERBB2 targeted therapy in endometrial cancer with PTEN deficiency. Histopathological and molecular analysis was performed for Ptend/d and Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice. Histopathological analysis revealed that Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice significantly reduced development and progression of endometrial cancer compared to Ptend/d mice. Furthermore, percentages of proliferative cells in Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice revealed anti-tumorigenic effect of Erbb2 ablation compared to Ptend/d mice. Our results demonstrate that Erbb2 ablation reveals a significant suppression of tumorigenesis on endometrial cancer of Ptend/d mice. Our results suggest that Erbb2 functions as an oncogene in endometrial cancer of Ptend/d mice implying that Erbb2 targeting can be used as an effective therapeutic approach for treatment of endometrial cancer with PTEN deficiency to hinder cancer development.","AbstractBackground:Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent type of cancer with a high mortality rate in its late stages. One of the major challenges in OSCC treatment is the resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanism underlying drug resistance and develop appropriate precision therapy strategies to enhance clinical efficacy.Methods:To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) inhibitor KN93 and EGFR inhibitors, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments using two FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1)-deficient (SCC9 and SCC25) and two FAT1 wild-type (SCC47 and HN12) OSCC cell lines. We assessed the effects of EGFR inhibitors (afatinib or cetuximab), KN93, or their combination on the malignant phenotype of OSCC in vivo and in vitro. The alterations in protein expression levels of members of the EGFR signaling pathway and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) were analyzed. Changes in the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) protein were characterized. Moreover, we analyzed mitochondrial dysfunction. Besides, the effects of combination therapy on mitochondrial dynamics were also evaluated.Results:OSCC with FAT1 mutations exhibited resistance to EGFR inhibitors treatment. The combination of KN93 and EGFR inhibitors significantly inhibited the proliferation, survival, and migration of FAT1-mutated OSCC cells and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, combination therapy enhanced the therapeutic sensitivity of FAT1-mutated OSCC cells to EGFR inhibitors by modulating the EGFR pathway and downregulated tumor stemness-related proteins. Furthermore, combination therapy induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, ultimately resulting in tumor suppression.Conclusion:Combination therapy with EGFR inhibitors and KN93 could be a novel precision therapeutic strategy and a potential clinical solution for EGFR-resistant OSCC patients with FAT1 mutations.",0
"PurposeColorectal cancer, as a common malignant tumor, poses a serious threat to human life. Cordycepin, derived from Cordyceps militaris extract, which was established as a capable inhibitor of tumor growth. Nevertheless, the precise antitumor mechanism of cordycepin in colorectal cancer cells remains elusive.MethodsHerein, our initial focus was to explore the tumor-suppressive impact of cordycepin through its influence on various biological functions in murine colorectal cancer cells, conducted by an in vitro setting. First, we investigated the tumor-suppressive effect of cordycepin on the regulation of biological functions in murine colorectal cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, we evaluated the in vivo antitumor potential of cordycepin using a mouse preclinical tumor model, and further explored the antitumor mechanism.ResultsOur findings revealed that cordycepin effectively inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of murine colon cancer cells. Moreover, there is a substantial reduction in the expression of PD-L1 observed in tumor cells, in response to cordycepin treatment. Collectively, these results demonstrate the significant tumor-suppressive attributes of cordycepin against colorectal cancer. Consequently, our study lays a solid foundation for the potential clinical utilization of cordycepin in cancer therapy.ConclusionCordycepin inhibits the biological functions of colorectal cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth by reducing the expression of PD-L1.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05460-0.","BackgroundExosomes are extracellular nanometric vesicles used by cells to communicate with each other. They are responsible for many pathological conditions, including tumors by transferring regulatory biomolecules that impact target cell activity. Because of their high concentration in exosomes compared with parental cells and the rest of exosomal content, specificity to the cell of origin, and their well-organized sorting mechanism, microRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to be the most potent exosomes cargo and used by scientists to track exosomes and to detect cell activity changes and prognosis in cancer early.PurposeIn this review, the results of studies examining the role of exosomes in cancer pathophysiology and their clinical potential are discussed in detail.Summary of the FindingsTumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) mediate the dynamic changes of cancer growth and invasion, including local microenvironment remodeling, distance metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor-associated immunosuppression. They also contribute to hypoxia-induced tumor progression and cancer cell drug resistance. As a result of exosomes being present in all body fluids, it is possible to have early accessible and less-invasive diagnostic and prognostic measures by forming a table for each cancer type and its matched specific miRNAs. Under testing, available therapeutic uses of exosomes include interference of exosomes biogenesis, secretion, or uptake, and recruitment of exosomes as target-specific drug delivery vehicles, and immunostimulatory agents for both cancer patients and healthy population to avoid cancer development from the start.ConclusionThese data suggest that exosomes and exosomal microRNA are directly related to cancer progression mechanisms, and could be used in cancer early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.",0
"Increasing evidence indicates that Calumenin (CALU), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is significantly associated with tumor progression. However, the effect of CALU on patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unknown. By integrating multi-omics data and molecular biology experiments, we found that CALU expression was significantly increased in tumors compared with normal tissues, and the pathological grade and prognosis of patients were correlated with CALU expression. Next, knockdown or ectopic expression of CALU could affect the proliferative and invasive abilities of ccRCC cells. Moreover, immune landscape characterization revealed that CALU expression was positively associated with neutrophils and macrophages, whereas it was negatively associated with natural killer T cells and CD8+ T cells. Single-cell sequencing showed that the localization and binding targets of CALU mainly involved monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Sensitivity analysis of common chemotherapeutic drugs showed that high expression of CALU could sensitize chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol, AMG-706 and Cytarabine, but could lead to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as Embelin, Salubrinal and Tipifarnib. We demonstrated a significant correlation between high CALU expression and poor patient survival. Further, we demonstrated a correlation between CALU expression, tumor microenvironment, and the sensitivity of patients to common chemo- and immuno-therapy drugs. Thus, our results indicate that CALU could be a biomarker and designing personalized treatment approaches for ccRCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00169-7.","BackgroundPan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) is an easily accessible immune marker based on peripheral blood to estimate prognosis in patients with cancer.

"PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.","Given the challenges with achieving effective and durable treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer, primary prevention is highly desirable. Fortunately, decades of research have provided evidence for several strategies that can be deployed to optimize risk reduction. These include surgery, chemoprevention, and lifestyle factor modifications. These broad categories vary in terms of the magnitude of risk reduction possible, the possible short-term and long-term side effects, the degree of difficulty, and acceptability. Thus, the concept of a risk-based model to personalize preventive interventions is advocated to guide discussion between care providers and women at risk. For women with inherited major gene mutations that greatly increase risk of ovarian cancer, surgical approaches have favorable risk to benefit ratios. Chemoprevention and lifestyle factor modifications portend a lower degree of risk reduction but confer lower risk of undesirable side effects. Since complete prevention is not currently possible, better methods for early detection remain a high priority.",0
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an immune-enriched subset of breast cancer that has recently demonstrated clinical responsiveness to combinatorial immunotherapy. However, the lack of targeted interventions against hormone receptors or HER2 continues to limit treatment options for these patients. To begin expanding available interventions for patients with metastatic TNBC, we previously reported a therapeutic vaccine regimen that significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastases in a pre-clinical TNBC model. This heterologous vaccine approach “primed” mice with tumor lysate antigens encapsulated within poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid microparticles (PLGA MPs) then “boosted” mice with tumor lysates plus adjuvant. The use of the PLGA MP prime as monotherapy demonstrated no efficacy, suggesting that improving this component of our therapy would achieve greater vaccine efficacy. Here, we functionally improved the PLGA MP prime by coating microparticles with biotinylated streptavidin-conjugated using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminoproplyl) carbodiimide/ N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/Sulfo-NHS) linkers. This modification enhanced the immunostimulatory potential of our PLGA MPs, as evidenced by increased phagocytosis, maturation, and stimulatory ligand expression of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Therapeutic prime/boost vaccination of TNBC-bearing mice with surfaced-coated PLGA MPs significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastases by an average of 56% relative to mice primed with unmodified PLGA MPs, and a significant 88% average reduction in spontaneous lung metastases relative to untreated control mice. These findings illustrate that relatively common biotin-streptavidin conjugation formulations can positively affect microparticle-based vaccine immunogenicity resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy against established pre-clinical mammary tumors.","Purpose:Neoadjuvant anti-PD-(L)1 therapy improves the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in unselected triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Given the potential for long-term morbidity from immune-related adverse events (irAEs), optimizing the risk-benefit ratio for these agents in the curative neoadjuvant setting is important. Suboptimal clinical response to initial neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is associated with low rates of pCR (2–5%) and may define a patient selection strategy for neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade. We conducted a single-arm phase II study of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel as the second phase of NAT in patients with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)-resistant TNBC (NCT02530489).Methods:Patients with stage I-III, AC-resistant TNBC, defined as disease progression or a <80% reduction in tumor volume after 4 cycles of AC, were eligible. Patients received atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3weeks x4) and nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2 IV,Q1 week x12) as the second phase of NAT before undergoing surgery followed by adjuvant atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3 weeks, x4). A two-stage Gehan-type design was employed to detect an improvement in pCR/residual cancer burden class I (RCB-I) rate from 5% to 20%.Results:From 2/15/2016 through 1/29/2021, 37 patients with AC-resistant TNBC were enrolled. The pCR/RCB-I rate was 46%. No new safety signals were observed. Seven patients (19%) discontinued atezolizumab due to irAEs.Conclusion:This study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a promising signal of activity in this high-risk population (pCR/RCB-I=46% vs 5% in historical controls), suggesting that a response-adapted approach to the utilization of neoadjuvant immunotherapy should be considered for further evaluation in a randomized clinical trial.",1
"PurposeColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, and its incidence and mortality rates are increasing every year. The intestinal microbiota has been called the ""neglected organ"" and there is growing evidence that the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites can be used in combination with immunotherapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy to greatly enhance the treatment of colorectal cancer and to address some of the side effects and adverse effects of these therapies. Antibiotics have great potential to eliminate harmful microbiota, control infection, and reduce colorectal cancer side effects. However, the use of antibiotics has been a highly controversial issue, and numerous retrospective studies have shown that the use of antibiotics affects the effectiveness of treatment (especially immunotherapy). Understanding the bi-directional role of the gut microbiota and antibiotics will further enhance our research into the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.MethodsWe searched the ""PubMed"" database and selected the following keywords ""intestinal microbiota, antibiotics, treatment, prevention, colorectal cancer"". In this review, we discuss the role of the intestinal microbiota in immunotherapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, diagnosis, and prevention of CRC. We also conclude that the intestinal microbiota and antibiotics work together to promote the treatment of CRC through a bidirectional effect.ResultsWe found that the intestinal microbiota plays a key role in promoting immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, diagnosis and prevention of CRC. In addition, gut microbiota and antibiotic interactions could be a new strategy for CRC treatment.ConclusionThe bi-directional role of the intestinal microbiota and antibiotics plays a key role in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of colorectal cancer.","BackgroundNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome with a birth prevalence of approximately 1 in 2000–3000 individuals. Management of both benign and malignant tumors arising in individuals with NF1 is demanding and tumors may be difficult to treat. Both standardized and individual surveillance programs are therefore highly important to prevent morbidity and mortality in patients with NF1.MethodsThe guidelines for the clinical management of NF1 recently proposed by the European Reference Network for Genetic Tumor Risk Syndromes provide the cornerstone of the present surveillance form and were discussed through three rounds of voting and a final consensus meeting involving experts from five Austrian and one German clinical NF1 centers for adults and one patient organization representative. Subsequently, 31 items within 4 categories were integrated into the proposed surveillance form for Austria. All recommendations, unless otherwise specified, pertain to primarily asymptomatic patients in routine follow-up.RecommendationsAt healthcare transition from pediatric to adult surveillance or the initial visit in adulthood, we suggest a thorough clinical, laboratory and radiological examination to obtain a baseline for future diagnostics. To comply with the general screening recommendations in Austria, we suggest extending the frequency of clinical visits from annual to biennial at 50 years of age. In cases of clinical dynamics, early follow-up is recommended to facilitate early detection of potential complications. Particular emphasis should be placed on preventive patient education.Supplementary InformationThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00508-024-02443-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"AbstractBackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a strong risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing hospitalization for COVID-19 with VTE.MethodsAdults hospitalized at 21 sites between March 2021 and October 2022 with symptoms of acute respiratory illness were assessed for COVID-19, completion of the original monovalent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination series, and VTE. Prevalence of VTE was compared between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients with COVID-19. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was calculated using a test-negative design. The VE was also stratified by predominant circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant.ResultsAmong 18 811 patients (median age [interquartile range], 63 [50–73] years; 49% women; 59% non-Hispanic white, 20% non-Hispanic black, and 14% Hispanic; and median of 2 comorbid conditions [interquartile range, 1–3]), 9792 were admitted with COVID-19 (44% vaccinated), and 9019 were test-negative controls (73% vaccinated). Among patients with COVID-19, 601 had VTE diagnosed by hospital day 28, of whom 170 were vaccinated. VTE was more common among unvaccinated than vaccinated patients with COVID-19 (7.8% vs 4.0%; P = .001). The VE against COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was 84% overall (95% confidence interval, 80%–87%), and VE stratified by predominant circulating variant was 88% (73%–95%) for Alpha, 93% (90%–95%) for Delta, and 68% (58%–76%) for Omicron variants.ConclusionsVaccination with the original monovalent mRNA series was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE, though data detailing prior history of VTE and use of anticoagulation were not available. These findings will inform risk-benefit considerations for those considering vaccination.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting in millions of infections and deaths worldwide. Although vaccines are available, they appear to be less efficacious against newly emerging variants of the virus. Thus, therapeutic modalities are urgently needed. The coronavirus genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and envelope (E) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete viral particle. N protein is one of the most abundant structural proteins, participates in the regulation of viral replication and virion assembly, and is a major immunogen in coronavirus infection-induced disease. Sialylation is the addition of sialic acids to the terminal glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which act as key components for biological functions of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Sialidases (or neuraminidases) are glycosidases that remove sialic acid residues (desialylation) from glycan portions of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Through desialylation, sialidases modulate the functionality of sialic acid-containing molecules and are involved in both physiological and pathological pathways. This review aims to explore the current understanding of NEU1’s involvement in coronavirus infection and pathogenesis, synthesizing available research and identifying areas for future investigation.",1
"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid β (Aβ)-triggered cleavage of TrkB-FL impairs brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, thereby compromising neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic transmission and plasticity. Using cerebrospinal fluid and postmortem human brain samples, we show that TrkB-FL cleavage occurs from the early stages of the disease and increases as a function of pathology severity. To explore the therapeutic potential of this disease mechanism, we designed small TAT-fused peptides and screened their ability to prevent TrkB-FL receptor cleavage. Among these, a TAT-TrkB peptide with a lysine-lysine linker prevented TrkB-FL cleavage both in vitro and in vivo and rescued synaptic deficits induced by oligomeric Aβ in hippocampal slices. Furthermore, this TAT-TrkB peptide improved the cognitive performance, ameliorated synaptic plasticity deficits and prevented Tau pathology progression in vivo in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. No evidence of liver or kidney toxicity was found. We provide proof-of-concept evidence for the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic strategy and anticipate that this TAT-TrkB peptide has the potential to be a disease-modifying drug that can prevent and/or reverse cognitive deficits in patients with AD.","ObjectivesThe aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with recurrent and metastatic sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and evaluate the current treatment strategies to help guide future management.DesignThis is a retrospective cohort study.SettingThe study was conducted at six international tertiary treatment centers.ParticipantsPatients with documented diagnoses of recurrent or metastatic SNUC since 1983 were included in the study.Main Outcome MeasuresPatient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected. Primary outcome measures included disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), and time to recurrence (TTR) following initial treatment. Further univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess for prognostic factors.Results A total of 97 patients with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 52.4 (15.6) were identified, 15 of whom presented with metastatic SNUC and 90 of whom developed recurrence. Management in both populations was widely variable. For patients with metastatic disease, the 1-year DSS probability was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8–100%). For patients with recurrent SNUC, the 1- and 5-year DSS probabilities were 45.7% (95% CI, 31.9–65.6%) and 8.6% (95% CI, 2.9–25.3%), respectively. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) TTR was 8 months (3–18.5 months). Multivariable analyses revealed a significant association between orbital involvement on initial presentation and TTR (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.28; 95% CI, 1.45–7.42; p = 0.004). ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study addressing metastatic and recurrent SNUC based on a large patient cohort. Orbital extension of the primary SNUC may predict a higher probability of recurrence following treatment, suggesting the possible utility of a more aggressive treatment in this subgroup of patients. A heterogenous patient population and wide variability in management emphasize the challenges in standardizing care; however, dismal survival rates demonstrate the necessity for further evaluation of current approaches to improve evidence-based recommendations.",0
"BackgroundChemokines play a vital role in tumor progression, metastasis and prognosis; however, the profile and clinical significance of gamma interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and its receptor (CXCR3) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well evaluated.MethodsLiquid-phase chip technology was used to detect the serum IP-10 in 85 patients with HBV-related HCC, 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 50 liver cirrhosis subjects (CS); simultaneously, the CXCR3 and Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) were determined. Additionally, their mRNA or protein expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), liver tumor and paracancerous tissues were quantified using qRT-PCR or ELISA. Moreover, the IP-10 and CXCR3 expression was verified by the online data from Gene Expression Omnibus. Furthermore, the relationships of serum IP-10, CXCR3 and AFP levels with their overall survival rate were also analyzed.ResultsThe levels of IP-10 and CXCR3 in HCC group were significantly higher than those in CHB and CS groups, and their mRNA of PBMC is significantly positive correlation with those in their liver tissues or HBV DNA load (P < 0.0001), respectively. The serum IP-10 and CXCR3 in HCC were significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, metastases staging and distant metastasis (P < 0.05), but not related to gender, age and tumor size (P > 0.05, except IP-10 based on age).ConclusionsThe serum IP-10 (142.6 pg/mL) and CXCR3 (241.2 pg/mL) could be differential diagnostic surrogates that distinguish HCC from CS, and the lower IP-10 level may be conducive to the postoperative survival of HCC patients. Moreover, the IP-10 and CXCR3 would be related to anti-tumor immunity in HCC patients and be a potential target for treatment of HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05265-1.","The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) derived from the CD30 specific murine antibody, HRS-3, has produced promising clinical efficacy with a favorable safety profile in the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD30-positive lymphomas. However, persistence of the autologous CAR-T cells was brief, and many patients relapsed a year after treatment. The lack of persistence may be attributed to the use of a wild-type immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 spacer that can associate with Fc receptors. We first identified the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) 5 of CD30 as the primary binding epitope of HRS-3 and armed with this insight, attempted to improve the HRS-3 CAR functionality with a panel of novel spacer designs. We demonstrate that HRS-3 CARs with OX40 and 4-1BB derived spacers exhibited similar anti-tumor efficacy, circumvented interactions with Fc receptors, and secreted lower levels of cytokines in vitro than a CAR employing the IgG1 spacer. Humanization of the HRS-3 scFv coupled with the 4-1BB spacer preserved potent on-target, on-tumor efficacy, and on-target, off-tumor safety. In a lymphoma mouse model of high tumor burden, T cells expressing humanized HRS-3 CD30.CARs with the 4-1BB spacer potently killed tumors with low levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines, providing a promising candidate for future clinical development in the treatment of CD30-positive malignancies.",0
"Background and Clinical Significance: Radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) following immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has been infrequently reported. Case Presentation: We present a 47-year-old female patient who developed RRD of the breast following three doses of pembrolizumab administered as an adjuvant treatment post-nephrectomy for Stage III renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Notably, the affected breast had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy 247 weeks earlier for Stage IA invasive ductal carcinoma. She had received no prior chemotherapy at any point. RRD manifested as breast induration, erythema, and peau d’orange, and contraction of breast volume was noted following three cycles of pembrolizumab on week 17 (400 mg dose every 6 weeks). The dermatitis responded rapidly to systemic corticosteroids and no treatment interruption was needed. Conclusions: To date, this is the longest reported interval from completion of radiotherapy to RRD. A literature search underscores the variability in presentation and management of ICI-associated RRD.","AbstractRationale:Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare tumor with a poor prognosis and has no recommended therapy after first-line pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on peritoneal mesothelioma remains to be elucidated. We herein report the case of a 75-year-old man with peritoneal mesothelioma treated with cisplatin plus pemetrexed and subsequent nivolumab.Patient concerns:A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to lower abdominal pain.Diagnosis:Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (CT) showed the accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in an intraperitoneal mass. A histological examination of a laparoscopic biopsy specimen revealed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.Interventions:After 4 cycles of cisplatin plus pemetrexed and 13 subsequent cycles of pemetrexed maintenance therapy showed beneficial responses until CT revealed liver metastasis. Nivolumab was then administered as the second-line therapy.Outcomes:After 3 cycles of biweekly nivolumab administration, he developed severe abdominal distention. CT revealed an intraperitoneal mass growing much more rapidly than ever, indicating hyperprogressive disease after nivolumab treatment. He ultimately died 51 days after the initial nivolumab administration.Lessons:To our knowledge, this is the first report of hyperprogressive disease in a case of peritoneal mesothelioma after nivolumab treatment. While immune checkpoint inhibitors may be promising therapeutic strategies for treating malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, careful monitoring must be practiced with their application.",1
"Background:Metastatic melanoma of the ampulla of Vater is rare. The purpose of this study was to summarize the characteristics and outcomes of metastatic melanoma in the ampulla of Vater and highlight the impact of surgery on the prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma.Methods:Pooled data from a case encountered at our institution and from all sporadic cases published on PubMed and MEDLINE between 1996 and 2023 were analyzed.Results:Fourteen patients with metastatic melanoma in the ampulla of Vater were enrolled. Ten (73%) of primary melanomas were cutaneous and two were mucosal. Jaundice was the most common symptom (86%). The size of metastatic melanoma to the ampulla ranged from 1.5 to 8 cm, with a median of 2.75 cm. Concomitant metastasis to other organs occurred in 82% of the patients at the time of diagnosis, most commonly in the brain, lungs, and liver (36% each). Among the reported cases, pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in five patients. The overall 1-year survival rate was 27.3%, with a median survival of 4 months. Wide excision of the primary lesion and chemotherapy significantly improved survival rates (50% vs. 0%, p = 0.048).Conclusion:There may be a trend toward improved survival in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by chemotherapy. Given the availability of effective systemic therapies, metastatic melanoma of the ampulla of Vater does not necessarily preclude major surgeries.","ABSTRACTCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a powerful measure of minimal residual disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although immunotherapy has been widely established in metastatic CRC that is mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H), its role in non-metastatic CRC is rapidly evolving. In resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage II CRC, adjuvant fluoropyrimidine has no benefit and is not recommended. There is growing evidence to suggest diminished benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation in localized CRC that is dMMR/MSI-H. We present two cases of dMMR/MSI-H stage III CRC treated with definitive surgery wherein adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy led to a failure to clear postoperative plasma ctDNA levels, prompting a change to immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab and resultant ctDNA clearance. We illustrate that chemotherapy may achieve suboptimal disease control in localized colon cancer that is dMMR/MSI-H, while plasma ctDNA offers a window of opportunity to gauge the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy to clear microscopic disease in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer. These findings are important to contextualize given that relapse is inevitable with failure to clear MRD in the postoperative stage I-III CRC setting whereby chemotherapy remains the standard adjuvant therapy in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer.",0
"ABSTRACTBreast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms affecting women worldwide, and it remains a leading cause of both mortality and morbidity. While genetic predisposition plays a critical role in the development of this neoplasm, significant epigenetic dysregulations accompany existing variants. The emergence of acquired drug resistance to current chemotherapeutics poses a significant challenge in managing therapy. However, progress has been made in developing novel agents that directly target epigenetic modifications. These agents, called “epi-drugs,” can be used alone in the clinic or in combination with current treatment regimens, offering the potential to create diversified effects on the disease’s predictive process. Within the scope of this review, general information about the major epigenetic dysregulations in breast cancer will be provided, and their effects on the molecular mechanisms in the carcinogenesis process will be discussed. Furthermore, current treatment approaches for breast cancer will be explored, classifying these epi-drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), histone acetyltransferases (HATIs), and others that have been developed to target these mechanisms. Predictions regarding the future prospects of these epi-drugs are highlighted, and their contributions to the field of personalized medicine are emphasized based on the results obtained from clinical studies.","BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a poor prognosis due to its therapeutic resistance. Inactivation of vitamin D/vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling may contribute to the malignant phenotype of PDA and altered expression of oncoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1) may be involved in drug resistance of cancer cells.AimTo determine whether vitamin D/VDR signaling regulates the expression and function of MUC1 and its effect on acquired gemcitabine resistance of pancreatic cancer cells.MethodsMolecular analyses and animal models were used to determine the impact of vitamin D/VDR signaling on MUC1 expression and response to gemcitabine treatment.ResultsRPPA analysis indicated that MUC1 protein expression was significantly reduced in human PDA cells after treatment with vitamin D3 or its analog calcipotriol. VDR regulated MUC1 expression in both gain- and loss-of-function assays. Vitamin D3 or calcipotriol significantly induced VDR and inhibited MUC1 expression in acquired gemcitabine-resistant PDA cells and sensitized the resistant cells to gemcitabine treatment, while siRNA inhibition of MUC1 was associated with paricalcitol-associated sensitization of PDA cells to gemcitabine treatment in vitro. Administration of paricalcitol significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in xenograft and orthotopic mouse models and increased the intratumoral concentration of dFdCTP, the active metabolite of gemcitabine.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate a previously unidentified vitamin D/VDR-MUC1 signaling axis involved in the regulation of gemcitabine resistance in PDA and suggests that combinational therapies that include targeted activation of vitamin D/VDR signaling may improve the outcomes of patients with PDA.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundTumoral melanosis (TM) is a histological term to describe a nodular aggregation of macrophages containing melanin pigment (melanophages) that is devoid of viable melanocytes. It is most often identified in skin, where it may be appreciated clinically as a pigmented lesion; however, it can also be found in other organs such as lymph nodes. The presence of TM is usually thought to signify the presence of a regressed melanoma or other pigmented tumor. Until recently, it was a relatively uncommon finding; however, with the use of effective systemic therapies against melanoma, its occurrence in histological specimens is more frequent.MethodsWe identified and reviewed all histopathological diagnoses of TM at any organ site reported at a single institution from 2006 to 2018. TM cases were paired with non‐TM cases of cutaneous melanoma through propensity score matching at a 1:2 ratio, and their survival outcomes were compared. The clinical outcomes examined included recurrence‐free survival (RFS), distant disease‐free survival (DDFS), melanoma‐specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).ResultsTM was reported in 79 patients. Their median age was 65 years (range 22–88), with a 2:1 male predominance (51 out of 79, 65%). The most common organ involved was the skin (67%), with a third of all cases localized to a lower limb (36%). TM had a strong association with the presence of melanoma (91%) and regression at other sites of melanoma (54%), suggesting that it is part of a systemic immune response against melanoma. Most patients with TM either previously or subsequently developed histologically confirmed melanoma in the same anatomical region as the TM (89%). Thirty‐five TM patients were matched with 70 non‐TM cases. Patients with melanoma who developed TM without prior regional or systemic therapy showed improved MSS (p = 0.03), whereas no statistically significant differences were observed in terms of RFS, DDFS, and OS.ConclusionsTM usually occurs in the context of a previous or subsequent cutaneous melanoma and is associated with improved MSS. It is important that TM is recognized by pathologists and documented in pathology reports.","ABSTRACTCancer is increasingly being recognized as a global health issue with considerable unmet medical need. Despite the rapid progression of anticancer pharmaceuticals, there are still significant challenges for the effective management of cancer. In many circumstances, cancer cells are difficult to detect and treat. Combination of nanovesicles (NVs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), referred as magnetic nanovesicles (MNVs), is now well recognized as a potential theranostic option for improving cancer treatment outcomes and reducing adverse effects. MNVs can be used for monitoring the long-term fate and functional benefits of cancer therapy. Moreover, MNV-mediated hyperthermia mechanism has been explored as a potential technique for triggering cancer cell death, and/or controlled release of laden cargo. In this review, we focus on the unique characteristics of MNVs as a promising avenue for targeted drug delivery, diagnosis, and treatments of cancer or tumor. Moreover, we discuss critical considerations related to the issues raised in this area, which will guide future research toward better anti-cancer therapeutics for clinical applications.",1
"Evolving evidence indicates that tumor cells can transdifferentiate between distinct transcriptionally-determined cell states with changes in resultant phenotypes, a phenomenon known as cellular plasticity. These transitions are not driven by genetic mutations and typically in contrast to normal developmental processes, may proceed bidirectionally. Here, we review the role of cellular plasticity in the aggressive childhood solid tumor, neuroblastoma. We discuss the detection of two cell states, termed mesenchymal (MES) and adrenergic (ADRN), their properties and the transcriptional circuitries that control them, their relation to the normal embryogenesis of the sympathetic nervous system and their potential role in drug resistance, escape from therapy and development of relapse.","Purpose:We evaluate the efficacy and safety of UGN-102 chemoablation for the primary treatment of patients with recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.Materials and Methods:ENVISION is an ongoing, multinational, single-arm, phase 3 study in patients with a biopsy-proven recurrence of untreated low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients received 6 weekly intravesical instillations of UGN-102 (mitomycin; outpatient setting) and were evaluated at 3 months. Patients achieving complete response (CR; negative cystoscopic examination, cytology, and for-cause biopsy) were surveilled regularly until recurrence, progression, or death. Patients who remain disease-free will be followed up to 5 years, and further results will be reported in the future.Results:Of 240 patients enrolled, 228 (95%) received all 6 planned doses; 191 (80%; 95% CI, 73.9-84.5) achieved CR at 3 months, with an 82% (95% CI, 75.9-87.1) probability of response 12 months later. Median duration of response was not estimable over a median 13.9-month follow-up period. The most common adverse events (≥5.0% of patients) were dysuria, hematuria, UTI, pollakiuria, fatigue, and urinary retention; generally mild/moderate and resolved/resolving. Serious adverse events were observed in 29/240 (12.1%); 2 were treatment related (urinary retention/urethral stenosis), and both resolved.Conclusions:Primary chemoablation with UGN-102 in patients with recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer resulted in an 80% CR rate. Patients achieving a CR had an 82% likelihood of remaining disease-free 1 year later. The benefit-risk profile was favorable, supporting UGN-102 as a nonsurgical alternative for transurethral resection of bladder tumors in this patient population. Limitations of this study included lack of tumor sizing after the diagnostic biopsy.Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05243550",0
"AbstractBackgroundInteractions between mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells (MES GSCs) and myeloid-derived macrophages (MDMs) shape the tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME), promoting the progression of glioblastoma (GBM). N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays important roles in the tumor progression. However, the mechanism of m6A in shaping the TIME of GBM remains elusive.MethodsSingle-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA-seq datasets were employed to identify the critical role of WTAP in interactions between MES GBM and MDMs. The biological function of WTAP was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, mass spectrum, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted.ResultsHere, we identified that m6A methyltransferase Wilms’ tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), whose protein stability could be synergistically enhanced via OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation and USP7-mediated de-ubiquitination, promoted LOXL2 m6A modification to enhance its mRNA stabilization in an IGF2BP2-dependent manner, upregulating secretion of LOXL2 protein (sLOXL2). sLOXL2 then interacted with integrin α5β1 on GSCs to activate FAK-ERK signaling, inducing mesenchymal transition of GSCs in an autocrine manner. Meanwhile, sLOXL2 also activated the integrin α5β1-FAK-ERK axis in MDMs, which promoted M2-like MDM phenotypes in a paracrine pathway, thereby contributing to T-cell exhaustion to induce GBM immune escape. In translational medicine, combinations of the OGT inhibitor by targeting WTAP expression and the LOXL2 antagonist by disrupting MES GSC and MDM interactions showed favorable outcomes to the anti-PD1 immunotherapy.ConclusionsWTAP plays critical roles in mesenchymal transition of GSCs and formation of TIME, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting WTAP and its downstream effectors to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.","Metabolic adaptation serves as a significant driving force for cancer growth and poses a substantial obstacle for cancer therapies. Herein, we unraveled the role of m6A-mediated serine synthesis pathway (SSP) regulation in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrated that treatment of highly specific m6A inhibitor (STM2457) effectively inhibited HCC cell line growth and suppressed spontaneous HCC formation in mice driven by liver-specific Tp53 knockout and Myc overexpression. Using GLORI-seq, we delineated a single-base-resolution m6A landscape in human HCC cell lines. Interestingly, we identified three core enzymes in the SSP (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) as novel targets of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In these SSP genes, m6A modification recruited m6A reader IGF2BP3 to stabilize their mRNA transcripts, thereby enhancing their mRNA and protein expression in HCC cells. Most importantly, our GLORI-seq data revealed that sorafenib-resistant HCC cells elevated m6A modification in SSP genes to promote protein expression and antioxidant production. STM2457 treatment attenuated the serine synthesis pathway, induced oxidative stress, and sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib treatments. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting m6A could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.",1
"ObjectivesThe presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI) and extranodal extension (ENE) have shown adverse outcomes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study evaluated the impact of LVI, PNI and ENE, individually and in combination, on survival outcomes in OSCC.Material and MethodsA retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained oral cancer database was done from January 2017 to March 2023. All consecutive OSCC patients who underwent curative intent surgery were included. The triple-positive group was defined by the presence of all three features (LVI/PNI/ENE), while the double-positive group had the presence of two features. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) analysis was done between different study groups.ResultsA total of 255 patients were included in the analysis. The LVI, PNI and ENE positivity was 13%, 26% and 11%, respectively. There were 19 patients (7%) with double-positive and ten patients (4%) with triple-positive disease. The triple-positive group had lower DFS than non-triple-positive (0% vs 57%, p-value 0.001) and lower OS (0% vs 72%, p-value 0.003). The median DFS and OS of the triple-positive group were eight months and 24 months, respectively. Similarly, the double-positive group also had statistically significant inferior DFS (p-value 0.007) and OS (p-value 0.002) compared to the single-positive/triple-negative group.ConclusionThe triple-positive disease had poor outcomes, with no patients achieving disease-free or overall survival at the 5-year follow-up. The presence of multiple adverse factors necessitates modification of adjuvant therapy and therapeutic strategy, which may enhance survival outcomes.","BackgroundDespite great advances in its early diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer is still an intractable disease and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and morbidity in the world. The family of Polo-like kinases (PLKs) consists of five serine/threonine kinases, which have been reported to participate in various human diseases. However, the expression and prognostic value of each PLK in human lung cancer have not been fully understood. This study analyzed mRNA expression and prognostic value of different PLKs in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsFirst, mRNA expression of PLKs in patients with NSCLC from the Oncomine and the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database was investigated. Then, a Kaplan–Meier plotter was employed for survival analysis. The sequence alteration for PLKs was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the cBioPortal database. Additionally, we analyzed the association among different PLKs using the LinkedOmics database. Finally, the enrichment analysis of PLKs was achieved using the DAVID database.ResultsThe mRNA expression levels of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly overexpressed, while mRNA expression level of PLK3 was underexpressed in patients with NSCLC. mRNA expressions of PLK1 and PLK4 were significantly and positively related to the tumor stage of NSCLC. Increased expressions of PLK1, PLK4, and PLK5 and decreased expression of PLK2 were attributed to limited overall survival time in NSCLC. PLK1 was positively correlated with PLK4 via the LinkedOmics database.ConclusionsPLKs are relevant targets for NSCLC treatment, especially PLK1 and PLK4.",1
"Purpose:This study aimed to compare accuracy and efficiency of a convolutional neural network (CNN)–enhanced workflow for pancreas segmentation versus radiologists in the context of interreader reliability.Methods:Volumetric pancreas segmentations on a data set of 294 portal venous computed tomographies were performed by 3 radiologists (R1, R2, and R3) and by a CNN. Convolutional neural network segmentations were reviewed and, if needed, corrected (“corrected CNN [c-CNN]” segmentations) by radiologists. Ground truth was obtained from radiologists’ manual segmentations using simultaneous truth and performance level estimation algorithm. Interreader reliability and model’s accuracy were evaluated with Dice-Sorenson coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard coefficient (JC). Equivalence was determined using a two 1-sided test. Convolutional neural network segmentations below the 25th percentile DSC were reviewed to evaluate segmentation errors. Time for manual segmentation and c-CNN was compared.Results:Pancreas volumes from 3 sets of segmentations (manual, CNN, and c-CNN) were noninferior to simultaneous truth and performance level estimation–derived volumes [76.6 cm3 (20.2 cm3), P < 0.05]. Interreader reliability was high (mean [SD] DSC between R2-R1, 0.87 [0.04]; R3-R1, 0.90 [0.05]; R2-R3, 0.87 [0.04]). Convolutional neural network segmentations were highly accurate (DSC, 0.88 [0.05]; JC, 0.79 [0.07]) and required minimal-to-no corrections (c-CNN: DSC, 0.89 [0.04]; JC, 0.81 [0.06]; equivalence, P < 0.05). Undersegmentation (n = 47 [64%]) was common in the 73 CNN segmentations below 25th percentile DSC, but there were no major errors. Total inference time (minutes) for CNN was 1.2 (0.3). Average time (minutes) taken by radiologists for c-CNN (0.6 [0.97]) was substantially lower compared with manual segmentation (3.37 [1.47]; savings of 77.9%–87% [P < 0.0001]).Conclusions:Convolutional neural network–enhanced workflow provides high accuracy and efficiency for volumetric pancreas segmentation on computed tomography.","Key Points•Quadriparesis and paraparesis are rare toxicities seen after CART therapy in children.•The mechanism of post-CART paresis is likely complex but not clearly inflammatory based on autopsy, CSF flow cytometry, or proteomic data.",0
"Purpose:Recent studies have shown that severe depletion of the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) induced by radiation therapy (RT) has been associated with poor overall survival of patients with many solid tumors. In this paper, we aimed to predict radiation-induced lymphocyte depletion in esophageal cancer patients during the course of RT based on patient characteristics and dosimetric features.Methods:We proposed a hybrid deep learning model in a stacked structure to predict a trend toward ALC depletion based on the clinical information before or at the early stages of RT treatment. The proposed model consisted of four channels, one channel based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network and three channels based on neural networks, to process four categories of features followed by a dense layer to integrate the outputs of four channels and predict the weekly ALC values. Moreover, a discriminative kernel was developed to extract temporal features and assign different weights to each part of the input sequence that enabled the model to focus on the most relevant parts. The proposed model was trained and tested on a dataset of 860 esophageal cancer patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy.Results:The performance of the proposed model was evaluated based on several important prediction metrics and compared to other commonly used prediction models. The results showed that the proposed model outperformed off-the-shelf prediction methods with at least a 30% reduction in the mean squared error (MSE) of weekly ALC predictions based on pretreatment data. Moreover, using an extended model based on augmented first-week treatment, data reduced the MSE of predictions by 70% compared to the model based on the pretreatment data.Conclusions:In conclusion, our model performed well in predicting radiation-induced lymphocyte depletion for RT treatment planning. The ability to predict ALC will enable physicians to evaluate individual RT treatment plans for lymphopenia risk and to identify patients at high risk who would benefit from modified treatment approaches.","ObjectivesPrior researches indicate that peripheral blood CD4 levels have an inverse correlation with distant tumor metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the linear relationship between CD4 and distant metastasis lacks clarity. Hence, the objective of this study was to ascertain the linear relationship between CD4 and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients.MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed clinical and laboratory data of NSCLC patients between March 2016 and July 2022 at the Cancer Hospital of Anhui University of Technology. The study first applied a generalized summation model and smoothing curve fitting to determine if there was a linear relationship between CD4 and NSCLC metastasis. Secondarily, univariate logistic analysis and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the odds ratio (OR) of CD4 as a continuous variable, dichotomous variable, and trichotomous variable when predicting NSCLC metastasis. In addition, stratified and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the reliability of CD4 in different NSCLC patient populations.ResultsThe study included a total of 213 NSCLC patients, among which 122 had distant metastasis and 91 had no metastasis. The smoothing curve fitting analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between CD4 and NSCLC metastasis with a threshold effect. The univariate logistic analysis indicated that continuous CD4 expression was not significantly associated with NSCLC metastasis (P = 0.051); however, high levels of CD4 expression (≥ 35.06%) were found to be a protective factor against NSCLC metastasis when CD4+ T was a dichotomous variable (OR = 0.49, P = 0.010). Furthermore, multivariate linear regression models showed that low (< 32%) or high levels (> 44%) of CD4 significantly increased the risk of NSCLC metastasis compared to medium levels (32–44%) when CD4+ T was trichotomized. The significance was maintained in stratified analysis in relation to age, sex, type of pathology, smoke, PS, and T stage. CD4 levels were U-shaped in relation to different sites of distant metastases (bone, brain, liver), but not with lung metastases.ConclusionsA threshold effect is shown to exist between the peripheral blood CD4 and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients. It was revealed that the risk of distant metastasis is lower when CD4 is maintained between 32 and 44%, whereas low (< 32%) or high (> 44) levels of CD4 are associated with an increased risk of distant metastasis in NSCLC patients.",0
"ABSTRACTRegenerative therapy, a key area of tissue engineering, holds promise for restoring damaged organs, especially in bone regeneration. Bone healing is natural to the body but becomes complex under stress and disease. Large bone deformities pose significant challenges in tissue engineering. Among various methods, scaffolds are attractive as they provide structural support and essential nutrients for cell adhesion and growth. Collagen and hydroxyapatite (HA) are widely used due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Collagen and nano-scale HA enhance cell adhesion and development. Thus, nano HA/collagen scaffolds offer potential solutions for bone regeneration. This review focuses on the use and production of nano-sized HA/collagen composites in bone regeneration.","Post-translational modifications (PTMs) immensely expand the diversity of the proteome. Glycosylation, among the most ubiquitous PTMs, is a dynamic and multifarious modification of proteins and lipids that generates an omnipresent foliage on the cell surface. The resulting protein glycoconjugates can serve important functions in biology. However, their vast complexity complicates the study of their structures, interactions, and functions. There is now a growing appreciation of the need to study glycans and proteins together as complete entities, as the sum of these two components can exhibit unique functions. In this review, we discuss the growing forestry toolbox to characterize the structure, interactions, and biological functions of protein glycoconjugates, as well as the potential payouts of understanding and controlling these enigmatic biomolecules.",0
"Background and ObjectiveHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers with high mortality rate worldwide. Surgical resection, liver transplantation (LT), and thermal ablation are primary curative methods for early-stage HCC. However, the high recurrence rate following surgical intervention is the primary factor contributing to the unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, the critical aspect in improving the overall survival of HCC lies in reducing the postoperative recurrence rate. This review is aimed at summarizing the current evidence base regarding the safety and efficacy of systemic therapy administered in the neoadjuvant context for patients with resectable HCC. Furthermore, we will offer a perspective on the potential future trajectories of systemic therapy as a neoadjuvant modality in the management of HCC.MethodsWe searched PubMed with terms: hepatocellular carcinoma, neoadjuvant, preoperative, chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, targeted therapy, systemic therapy, immunotherapy. Relevant ongoing clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov are included.Key Content and FindingsIn the context of resectable solid organ cancers, neoadjuvant therapy is frequently administered to delay disease progression, ensure appropriate patient selection, reduce tumor burden and potentially eradicate micrometastases prior to surgical procedures. In recent years, the advancements in systemic therapy for advanced HCC, especially with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy combination, have significantly contributed to notable improvements in overall survival. These breakthroughs have prompted the exploration and implementation of systemic therapy in the setting of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for HCC. In this review, we aim to briefly summarize the current available evidence on the safety and efficacy of systemic therapy in neoadjuvant settings designed to improve the outcome of curative-intent liver resection or LT for patients with resectable HCC. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and issues that need to be further clarified before widespread adoption of neoadjuvant therapies, providing an outlook on future directions of systemic therapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HCC.ConclusionsNeoadjuvant therapy involving immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, seems to exhibit the most promising characteristics of preventing recurrence and improving long-term survival of HCC patients following curative hepatectomy or LT, especially when combined with anti-angiogenic therapies and locoregional therapy. Further research is needed to identify suitable candidates, predictive biomarkers, optimal regimens for neoadjuvant therapy, and ideal timing for surgery.","Background:There is a growing literature base regarding menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination among premenopausal people. However, relatively little is known about uterine bleeding in postmenopausal people following COVID-19 vaccination.Objectives:To examine trends in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses over time before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction and describe cases of new-onset postmenopausal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design:All analyses focused on members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest ages 45 and older who were diagnosed with incident postmenopausal bleeding in the electronic medical record. Members with pre-existing postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding, or who were at increased risk of bleeding due to other health conditions, were excluded. We used segmented regression analysis to estimate changes in the incidence of postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses from 2018 through 2021 in Kaiser Permanente Northwest members meeting inclusion criteria, stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status in 2021. Additionally, we identified all members with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccination between December 14, 2020, through August 14, 2021, who had an incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnosis within 60 days of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination, diagnostic procedures, and presumed bleeding etiology were assessed through chart review and described. A temporal scan statistic was run on all cases without clear bleeding etiology.Results:In a population of approximately 80,000 individuals per month there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction (p=0.59). Among 48,438 vaccinated individuals, 104 had postmenopausal bleeding first diagnosed within 60 days following COVID-19 vaccination; 76% of cases (79/104) were confirmed as post-vaccination postmenopausal bleeding after chart review. Median time from vaccination to bleeding onset was 21 days (range: 2–54 days). Among the 56 postmenopausal bleeding cases with a provider-attributed etiology, the common causes of bleeding were uterine or cervical lesions (50% [28/56]), hormone replacement therapy (13% [7/56]), and proliferative endometrium (13% [7/56]). Among the 23 cases without a clear etiology, there was no statistically significant clustering of postmenopausal bleeding onset following vaccination.Conclusions:Within this integrated health system, introduction of COVID-19 vaccines was not associated with an increase in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses. Diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding in the 60 days following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination was rare.",0
"SUMMARYDetection of the presence of infection and its etiology must be accurate and timely to facilitate appropriate antimicrobial use. Diagnostic strategies that rely solely on pathogen detection often are insufficient due to poor test characteristics, inability to differentiate colonization from infection, or protracted delay to result. Understanding the human response across different pathogens on a clinical and molecular level can provide more accurate, timely, and useful answers, especially in critical illness and diagnostic uncertainty. Improvements in understanding the human immune response including genomics, protein analysis, gene expression, and cellular morphology have led to rapid innovation of new host response-based diagnostic tests. This review describes the limitations of pathogen-focused technology and the benefits of examining the breadth of immune response to diagnose infection. It then explores biomarkers that have been studied for this purpose and scrutinizes the performance of host-based multianalyte testing. Currently cleared diagnostics and those in late-stage development are described in depth, with a focus on the purpose of testing and its utility for clinicians. Finally, it concludes by examining opportunities for further host response-derived diagnostic innovation.","Cancer metabolic reprogramming has been considered an emerging hallmark in tumorigenesis and the antitumor immune response. Like cancer cells, immune cells within the tumor microenvironment or premetastatic niche also undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming, which profoundly impacts anti-tumor immune responses. Numerous evidence has illuminated that immunosuppressive TME and the metabolites released by tumor cells, including lactic acid, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), fatty acids (FAs), cholesterol, D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), adenosine (ADO), and kynurenine (KYN) can contribute to CD8+ T cell dysfunction. Dynamic alterations of these metabolites between tumor cells and immune cells can similarly initiate metabolic competition in the TME, leading to nutrient deprivation and subsequent microenvironmental acidosis, which impedes immune response. This review summarizes the new landscape beyond the classical metabolic pathways in tumor cells, highlighting the pivotal role of metabolic disturbance in the immunosuppressive microenvironment, especially how nutrient deprivation in TME leads to metabolic reprogramming of CD8+ T cells. Likewise, it emphasizes the current therapeutic targets or strategies related to tumor metabolism and immune response, providing therapeutic benefits for tumor immunotherapy and drug development in the future.

Dynamic alterations of metabolites between tumor cells and immune cells initiate metabolic competition in the TME, leading to nutrient deprivation and subsequent microenvironmental acidosis, which impedes immune response.",1
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is incurable and prone to widespread metastasis. Therefore, identification of key targets for TNBC progression is urgently needed. Our previous study revealed that isotoosendanin (ITSN) reduced TNBC metastasis by targeting TGFβR1. ITSN is currently used as an effective chemical probe to further discover the key molecules involved in TNBC metastasis downstream of TGFβR1. The results showed that GOT2 was the gene downstream of Smad2/3 and that ITSN decreased GOT2 expression by abrogating the activation of the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling pathway through directly binding to TGFβR1. GOT2 was highly expressed in TNBC, and its knockdown decreased TNBC metastasis. However, GOT2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of ITSN on TNBC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. GOT2 interacted with MYH9 and hindered its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1, thereby reducing MYH9 ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, GOT2 also enhanced the translocation of MYH9 to mitochondria and thus induced DRP1 phosphorylation, thereby promoting mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells. ITSN-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation was associated with reduced GOT2 expression. In conclusion, ITSN prevented MYH9-regulated mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells by enhancing MYH9 protein degradation through a reduction in GOT2 expression, thus contributing to its inhibition of TNBC metastasis.","Introduction/ObjectiveThe spread of tumors (48% in men and 51% in women), as well as the protection of malignant tumors by stromal cells and complex blood vessels, pose significant challenges to drug delivery to tumors. Modern chemotherapy, on the other hand, addresses tumor growth suppression by at least 60% through versatile formulation systems and numerous modifications to drug delivery systems. The renewable and naturally occurring polymers present invariably in all living cells form the fundamental foundation for most anticancer drug development. The review aims to discuss in detail the preparations of polysaccharide, lipid, and protein-based drug-loading vehicles for the targeted delivery of prominent anticancer drugs. It also provides an explanation of drug distribution in blood (cumulative releases of nearly 80% drug) and drug accumulation at tumor sites (1–5 mg/kg) due to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR).MethodsSpecific delivery examples for treating colorectal and breast carcinomas have been presented to distinguish the varied drug administration, bioavailability, and tumor internalization mechanisms between sugar, fatty acid, and amino acid polymers. Current therapy possibilities based on cutting-edge literature are provided, along with drug delivery systems tailored to tumor location and invasive properties.ResultsThe unique combinations of the three natural polymers provide unparalleled solutions to minimize the toxicity (<20% drug release) of the chemotherapeutic drugs on normal tissues. Moreover, the development of a consolidated drug delivery system has contributed to a substantial reduction (dose reduction from 10.43 µM to 1.9 µM) in the undesirable consequences of higher dosages of chemotherapeutic drugs.ConclusionThe review extensively covers safe chemotherapeutic systems with significant advantages (tumor volume shrinkage of 4T1 cells from 1000 mm3 to 200 mm3) in clinical applications of carcinoma treatments using natural polymers.",0
"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts that play a role in numerous malignant phenotypes, including hyperproliferation, invasion, and metastasis. These phenotypes correlate with activity of the Hippo pathway oncoprotein, Yes-associated protein-1 (YAP1), and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). YAP1/TAZ are normally involved in organ growth, under the regulation of various kinases and upon phosphorylation, are retained in the cytoplasm by chaperone proteins, leading to their proteasomal degradation. In CAFs and tumor cells, however, a lack of YAP1 phosphorylation results in its translocation to the nucleus, binding to TEAD transcription factors, and activation of mitogenic pathways. In this review we summarize the literature discussing the central role of YAP1 in CAF activation, the upstream cues that promote YAP1-mediated CAF activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and how CAFs mediate tumor-stroma crosstalk to support progression, invasion and metastasis in various cancer models. We further highlight YAP1+CAFs functions in modulating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and propose evaluation of several YAP1 targets regarding their role in regulating intra-tumoral immune landscapes. Finally, we propose that co-administration of YAP1- targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with advanced tumors.","Cervical cancer elimination is a global health priority with the ambitious 90:70:90 target set by the WHO. This initiative aims for 90% of girls to be vaccinated against HPV, 70% of women to be screened with a high-performance test, and 90% of those who test positive to receive appropriate treatment by 2030. This editorial reflects on the journey from the initial declaration in 2018 to the present, highlighting the progress, challenges, and future directions in the fight against cervical cancer. With significant contributions from organizations like FIGO and FOGSI, the introduction of cost-effective vaccines and advanced screening methods, we are on a path towards achieving our targets. However, persistent efforts and global collaboration are essential to overcome the remaining hurdles.",0
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting in millions of infections and deaths worldwide. Although vaccines are available, they appear to be less efficacious against newly emerging variants of the virus. Thus, therapeutic modalities are urgently needed. The coronavirus genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and envelope (E) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete viral particle. N protein is one of the most abundant structural proteins, participates in the regulation of viral replication and virion assembly, and is a major immunogen in coronavirus infection-induced disease. Sialylation is the addition of sialic acids to the terminal glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which act as key components for biological functions of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Sialidases (or neuraminidases) are glycosidases that remove sialic acid residues (desialylation) from glycan portions of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Through desialylation, sialidases modulate the functionality of sialic acid-containing molecules and are involved in both physiological and pathological pathways. This review aims to explore the current understanding of NEU1’s involvement in coronavirus infection and pathogenesis, synthesizing available research and identifying areas for future investigation.","Problem:Vaccination in pregnancy guards against infection. Maternal antibodies, however, can inhibit antibody production in neonates. We sought to determine the effects of maternal vaccination on neonatal immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.Method of Study:We hypothesized that mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNP) vaccination allows for a de novo neonatal antibody response even in the presence of vertically transmitted maternal antibodies. Female mice were vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA-LNPs. Mice were then bred, and 21-day-old pups were inoculated with the same mRNA-LNPs. Spike-specific IgG ELISAs were performed using mouse serum. A SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide library to perform peptide ELISAs characterized high affinity binding domains within the spike protein. Results were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests.Results:Compared to pups of unvaccinated dams, there were high levels of spike-specific IgG detected in the pups of vaccinated dams at 3 weeks of life (p < 0.0001). After neonatal vaccination, pups of unvaccinated dams had higher spike-specific serum IgG than pups of vaccinated dams at 12 weeks of life (p < 0.001). Antibody specificity to peptide moieties within spike RBD were similar when comparing a vaccinated dam to her pup at Week 3 of life, with different binding affinities observed in the pups by Week 15 of life.Conclusions:Pre-existing maternal antibodies may partially blunt the initial neonatal antibody response to mRNA-LNPs vaccination. This vaccine strategy, however, does not prohibit the subsequent development of a broad range of RBD antibody specificities that may be protective.",1
"BackgroundEsophageal cancer (EC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Gynostemma pentaphyllum Thunb. Makino (GpM) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine as a treatment for tumors and hyperlipidemia. Nevertheless, the active components and underlying mechanisms of anti-EC effects of GpM remain elusive.ObjectiveThis study aims to determine the major active ingredients of GpM in the treatment of EC and to explore their molecular mechanisms by using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro experiments.MethodsFirstly, active ingredients and potential targets of GpM, as well as targets of EC, were screened in relevant databases to construct a compound-target network and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that narrowed down the pool of ingredients and targets. This was followed by gene ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Next, molecular docking, ADME and toxicity risk prediction, cell viability assays, in vitro scratch assays, Transwell cell invasion assays, and Western blotting analysis were subsequently applied to validate the results of the network analysis.ResultsThe screening produced a total of 21 active ingredients and 167 ingredient-related targets for GpM, along with 2653 targets for EC. The PPI network analysis highlighted three targets of interest, namely AKT1, TP53, and VEGFA, and the compound-target network identified three possible active ingredients: quercetin, rhamnazin, and isofucosterol. GO and EKGG indicated that the mechanism of action might be related to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as well as the regulation of cell motility and cell migration. Molecular docking and pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that quercetin and isoprostanoid sterols may have therapeutic value and safety for EC. The in vitro experiments confirmed that GpM can inhibit EC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and suppress PI3K and AKT phosphorylation.ConclusionOur findings indicate that GpM exerts its anti-tumor effect on EC by inhibiting EC cell migration and invasion via downregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Hence, we have reason to believe that GpM could be a promising candidate for the treatment of EC.","BackgroundCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a prominent cancer-related complication occurring in Prostate cancer (PCa) patients, profoundly affecting prognosis. The lack of diagnostic criteria and biomarkers hampers the management of CRF.MethodsThe CRF-related data and PCa single-cell data were retrieved from the GEO database and clinical data was downloaded from the TCGA database. The univariate logistic/Cox regression analysis were used to construct the prediction models. The predictive value of models was analyzed using the ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier survival. The hub genes were screened by an intersection analysis of DEGs. The mice model of PCa and PCa-related fatigue were established, and fatigue-like behaviors of mice were detected. The expression of selected hub genes was validated by RT-PCR and IHC analysis.ResultsThe diagnosis and risk models showed great predictive value both in the training and validation dataset. Five genes (Baiap2l2, Cacng4, Sytl2, Sec31b and Ms4a1) that enriched the CXCL signaling were identified as hub genes. Among all hub genes, the MS4A1 expression is the most significant in PCa-related fatigue mice.ConclusionsWe identified MS4A1 as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of PCa-related fatigue. Our findings would lay a foundation for revealing the pathogenesis and developing therapies for PCa-related fatigue.",0
"PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.","PurposeLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for approximately half of patients in lung cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major component in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeting CAFs is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, therapeutic targets of CAFs in LUAD remains largely unclear.MethodsSeven CAFs and nine normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from tumor and paratumor tissues of LUAD patients undergoing surgery, respectively. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis were performed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their functions in CAFs compared with NFs. DEGs of ten overlaying were obtained from RNA-seq, our previously reported lncRNA microarray and public datasets (E-MTAB-6149, E-MTAB-6653) and validated by RT-qPCR. Nik-related kinase (NRK) was further validated by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence (IF), Western Blot (WB) in vitro, and in Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database. Survival analysis was performed on Kaplan–Meier plotter.ResultsA total of 1799 DEGs were identified, including 650 upregulated DEGs and 1149 downregulated DEGs. The upregulated and downregulated DEGs were mostly enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM) functions and in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways. Interestingly, NRK was the most significantly upregulated overlaying DEGs which was rarely associated with CAFs before. NRK was predominantly expressed in CAFs, but weakly expressed in NFs, normal lung bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, LUAD cell lines A549 and H1299, as well as in the majority of 191 lung cancer cell lines including LUAD. Moreover, elevated NRK predicted poor survival in LUAD patients.ConclusionHere, we first report that NRK is significantly elevated in LUAD-associated CAFs and may function as a promising therapeutic target for cancer combination treatment. Besides, modulation of ECM and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways may be an efficient approach to alter CAFs functionality in LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-020-03489-z.",1
"AbstractThe rumen plays an essential role in the physiology and health of ruminants. The rumen undergoes substantial changes in size and function from birth to adulthood. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are not clear. This study aimed to identify the transcription factors (TFs) and signaling pathways mediating these changes in cattle. We found that the ratios of the emptied rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum to body weight in adult steers were 4.8 (P < 0.01), 3.1 (P < 0.01), 6.0 (P < 0.01), and 0.8 (P = 0.9) times those in neonatal calves, respectively. The length of rumen papillae and the thickness of rumen epithelium, tunica mucosa and submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica serosa increased 7.4-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 2.9-, and 4.6-fold (P < 0.01 for all), respectively, from neonatal calves to adult steers. However, the density of rumen papillae was lower in adult steers than in neonatal calves (P < 0.05). The size of rumen epithelial cells was not different between neonatal calves and adult steers (P = 0.57). RNA sequencing identified 2,922 genes differentially expressed in the rumen between neonatal calves and adult steers. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that organ development, blood vessel development, Ras signaling, and Wnt signaling were among the functional terms enriched in genes downregulated in adult steers vs. neonatal calves and that fatty acid metabolism, immune responses, PPAR signaling, and Rap1 signaling were among those enriched in genes upregulated in adult steers vs. neonatal calves. Serum response factor (SRF), interferon regulatory factor 4, and purine-rich single-stranded DNA-binding protein alpha were among the major candidate TFs controlling the expression of genes upregulated, while TCF4, inhibitor of DNA binding 4, and snail family transcriptional repressor 2 were among those controlling the expression of genes downregulated in adult steers vs. neonatal calves. Taken together, these results suggest that the rumen grows by increasing the number, not the size, of cells from birth to adulthood, that the absorptive, metabolic, immune, and motility functions of the rumen are acquired or significantly enhanced during the postnatal life, and that the changes in rumen size and function from birth to adulthood are mediated by many candidate TFs, including SRF and TCF4, and many candidate signaling pathways, including the PPAR and Wnt signaling pathways.","ObjectiveTo investigate the value of gemcitabine and pirarubicin in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).Methods405 patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer admitted to our hospital from January 2012 to December 2020 who underwent transurethral bladder tumor electronic resection were studied. 177 patients were treated with gemcitabine (Gemcitabine group) and 228 patients were treated with pirarubicin (Pirarubicin group) after surgery. The efficacy and adverse effects of the two groups were observed and the patients were followed up.ResultsNo differences were found when comparing age, gender, smoking, bladder mass, number of masses, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hematuria and tumor diameter between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). In the Gemcitabine group, bladder irritation signs, meatus hematuria, fever, nausea and vomiting were lower than those in the Pirarubicin group (P < 0.05). The recurrence rates were 6.21% and 12.28% at 1 year, 11.86% and 23.68% at 2 years, 15.82% and 25.88% at 3 years in the Gemcitabine and Pirarubicin groups respectively, with the Gemcitabine group having a significantly lower recurrence rate than the Pirarubicin group (P < 0.05). The tumor recurrence-free survival rate for 5 years of gemcitabine was significantly higher than that of the Pirarubicin group (P < 0.05).ConclusionGemcitabine and pirarubicin are both effective in treating patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, with gemcitabine having a lower incidence of adverse reactions, a higher safety rating, a lower recurrence rate and an improved survival outcome.",0
"The Declaration of Geneva serves as a guide to ethical medical practice. It primarily addresses the duties of the physician in relation to an individual physician–patient relationship and implicitly advocates a ‘first come, first served’ model. It assumes the availability of adequate resources to treat all patients. However, no health system can meet all the requirements of its intended beneficiaries, and resource allocation, priority-setting and triaging are inevitable. Yet the Declaration of Geneva ‘does not permit considerations of age, disease or disability, gender …, social standing or any other factor’ to be considered. Neither does it permit consideration of ‘financial toxicity of treatment’ on patients, families and struggling healthcare systems. Making resource allocation, priority-setting, and triaging decisions is ethically complex. Yet in many resource-limited settings, such difficult and ethical judgement calls are left to individual physicians to make; this applies especially in low- and middle-income countries where practitioners are often faced with overwhelming burdens of disease and simply cannot treat everyone requiring care. The Declaration of Geneva should be amended to recognise limitations of physicians to deliver care because of health system constraints and should speak not only of a physician’s duty towards the individual patient but also to broader society. It should provide ethical guidance to those practising in limited resource settings about triaging, protecting elective care, ensuring training of well-rounded physicians, ensuring financial wellness of patients and healthcare systems and ensuring accountability for health and wellness of patients and healthcare systems.","Morreton virus (MORV) is a novel oncolytic Vesiculovirus, genetically distinct from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Herein we report that MORV induced potent cytopathic effects in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro models. In preliminary safety analyses, high intranasal doses (up to 1010 TCID50 ) of MORV were not associated with significant adverse effects in immune competent, non-tumor bearing mice. MORV was shown to be efficacious in a Hep3B hepatocellular cancer xenograft model, but not in a cholangiocarcinoma xenograft HuCCT1 model. In an immune competent, syngeneic murine cholangiocarcinoma model single intra-tumoral treatments with MORV (1 × 107 TCID50) triggered a robust antitumor immune response leading to substantial tumor regression and disease control at a dose 10-fold lower compared to VSV (1 × 108 TCID50). MORV led to increased CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, without compensatory increases in tumor associated macrophages, granulocytic or monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells. Our findings indicate that wild-type MORV is safe and can induce potent tumor regression via immune-mediated and immune-independent mechanisms in HCC and CCA animal models, without dose limiting adverse events. These data warrant further development and clinical translation of MORV as a novel oncolytic virotherapy platform.",0

"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematologic malignancy. Chemotherapy resistance results in a dismal survival rate of 1–2 years in older adults with AML. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently required. In this context, microRNA (miRNA)-based treatments remain an untapped strategy in AML. Using patient-derived specimens, we found increased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of older adults with AML, and decreased miR-497-5p in CD34+ leukemic blasts. Target prediction revealed that miR-497-5p could directly target mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAP2K1) mRNA to indirectly target cytokines and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway through the p38-MAPK signaling pathway, potentially inhibiting leukemic growth and overcoming chemoresistance from venetoclax. To improve miRNA delivery and minimize off-target effects, which represent key barriers to clinical translation, we developed liposomes for co-delivery of miR-497-5p and venetoclax. We decorated our liposomes with a peptide targeting CLL1, which is present on 92% of leukemia blasts while being absent in normal hematopoietic cells. This targeted approach demonstrated high efficacy in inhibiting AML growth in mice with minimal toxicity, as well as reduced exposure to chemoresistance. Our findings suggested that anti-CLL1-decorated, miR-497-5p, and venetoclax-loaded liposomes represent a promising novel miRNA-based therapeutic, which should be investigated further as a strategy to reduce venetoclax resistance in AML.","Aim: Cu2O nanoparticles were synthesized using an extract from S. latifolium algae (SLCu2O NPs). Their effect on PANC-1 cells and the expression of two drug resistance-related lncRNAs were evaluated in comparison with Arsenic trioxide.Materials & methods: SLCu2O NPs were characterized using XRD, SEM, and TEM microscopies. The effects of SLCu2O NPs on cell cytotoxicity, cell cycle, and apoptosis, and expression of two drug resistance-related lncRNAs were examined using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR, respectively.Results: SLCu2O NPs demonstrated anti-cancer properties against PANC-1 cells comparable to Arsenic trioxide, and the expression of lncRNAs increased upon treatment with them.Conclusion: SLCu2O NPs demonstrate anti-cancer properties against PANC-1 cells; however, using gene silencing strategies along with SLCu2O NPs is suggested.",1
"PurposeThe primary objective of this study was to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks and evaluate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and key biomarkers within the ceRNA networks in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients.MethodsComprehensive bioinformatics tools were used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs (DEMs), and lncRNAs (DELs) related to COAD, leading to the creation of ceRNA networks. The CIBERSORT technique was employed to assess the significance of TIICs in COAD, and an immune-related prognosis prediction model was subsequently developed. Co-expression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between key genes in ceRNA networks and immunologically significant TIICs. The study also utilized 5 GEO datasets and web-based databases to externally validate the findings.ResultsThe study revealed a statistically significant relationship between key hub genes and immune cells, as determined through co-expression analysis. Two hub regulators (SOX12 and H19) demonstrated significant prognostic value in the ceRNA-related prognostic model, and their elevated expression levels were verified across multiple CRC cell lines. Additionally, the knockdown of SOX12 led to a suppression of proliferation, migration, and invasion in colon cancer cells.ConclusionThrough the construction of ceRNA networks and evaluation of TIICs, the study successfully established two risk score models and nomograms. These models serve as valuable tools for understanding the molecular processes and predicting the prognosis of COAD patients. Further validation of hub regulators SOX12 and H19 substantiates their potential role as key biomarkers in COAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05316-7.","BackgroundHigh tumor mutation burden (TMB) failed to serve as a favorable prognostic biomarker for immunotherapy across all tumors. This study aimed to explore TMB-sensitive tumors on a pan-cancer level and construct their immune infiltration phenotypes in TMB-high groups.MethodsPan-cancer patients were separated into TMB-high and TMB-low groups based on the median TMB values per tumor. TMB-related genes were identified using differently expressed genes (DEGs) and differently mutated genes (DMGs) between the above two TMB groups. CIBERSORT algorithm was used to estimate the abundance of 22 tumor immune infiltrating cells (TIICs). Consensus clustering analysis was applied to predict molecular subtypes. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the correlations between hub genes and TIICs and immunomodulator genes.ResultsNine TMB-sensitive tumors were identified by high-frequency of TMB-related genes. A total of 126 tumor-specific hub genes (1 in BLCA, 19 in BRCA, 4 in COAD, 4 in HNSC, 25 in LUAD, 2 in LUSC, 27 in SKCM, 37 in STAD, and 7 UCEC) were identified. In five out of nine TMB-sensitive tumors, the molecular subtypes based on hub gene expression were characterized by TMB values, prognostic values and tumor-specific TIICs levels. In TMB-high groups, hub genes associated immune infiltration phenotypes were constructed with key TIICs and immunomodulators spanning TMB-sensitive tumors.ConclusionsOur tumor-specific analysis revealed hub genes associated immune infiltration features may serve as potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers of immunotherapy, providing the potential underlying mechanism of immune infiltration in TMB-high groups across TMB-sensitive tumors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04139-2.",1
"Over the last decade, cancer diagnostics has undergone a notable transformation with increasing complexity. Minimally invasive diagnostic tests, driven by advanced imaging and early detection protocols, is redefining patient care and reducing the need for more invasive procedures. Modern cytopathologists, beyond their diagnostic role, now safeguard patient samples for vital biomarker and molecular testing. In this article, we explore ancillary testing modalities and the role of biomarkers in organ-specific contexts, underscoring the transformative impact of precision medicine. Finally, the advent of more than 80 FDA-approved predictive biomarkers signals a new era, guiding cancer care toward personalized and targeted strategies.","Conventional forms of noninvasive cardiovascular imaging that evaluate morphology, function, flow, and metabolism play a vital role in individual treatment decisions, often based on guidelines. Innovations in molecular imaging have enhanced our ability to spatially quantify the expression of a wider array of disease-related proteins, genes, or cell types, or the activity of specific pathogenic pathways. These techniques, which usually rely on design of targeted imaging probes, have already been used extensively in cancer medicine and have now become part of cardiovascular care in conditions such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis. The recognition that common cardiovascular conditions are caused by a substantial diversity of pathobiologic pathways and the diversity of therapies available for use have rekindled interest in expanding the role of molecular imaging of tissue phenotype to improve precision in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making. The intent of this article is to raise awareness and understanding of approaches to molecular or cellular imaging of phenotype with targeted probes, and their potential to promote the principles of precision medicine. Also addressed are the diverse roles of molecular imaging to improve precision and efficiency of new drug development at the stages of candidate identification, preclinical testing, and clinical trials.",1
"Approximately 50 % of poor prognosis neuroblastomas arise due to MYCN over-expression. We previously demonstrated that MYCN and PRMT5 proteins interact and PRMT5 knockdown led to apoptosis of MYCN-amplified (MNA) neuroblastoma. Here we evaluate the highly selective first-in-class PRMT5 inhibitor GSK3203591 and its in vivo analogue GSK3326593 as targeted therapeutics for MNA neuroblastoma. Cell-line analyses show MYCN-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis, with approximately 200-fold greater sensitivity of MNA neuroblastoma lines. RNA sequencing of three MNA neuroblastoma lines treated with GSK3203591 reveal deregulated MYCN transcriptional programmes and altered mRNA splicing, converging on key regulatory pathways such as DNA damage response, epitranscriptomics and cellular metabolism. Stable isotope labelling experiments in the same cell lines demonstrate that glutamine metabolism is impeded following GSK3203591 treatment, linking with disruption of the MLX/Mondo nutrient sensors via intron retention of MLX mRNA. Interestingly, glutaminase (GLS) protein decreases after GSK3203591 treatment despite unchanged transcript levels. We demonstrate that the RNA methyltransferase METTL3 and cognate reader YTHDF3 proteins are lowered following their mRNAs undergoing GSK3203591-induced splicing alterations, indicating epitranscriptomic regulation of GLS; accordingly, we observe decreases of GLS mRNA m6A methylation following GSK3203591 treatment, and decreased GLS protein following YTHDF3 knockdown. In vivo efficacy of GSK3326593 is confirmed by increased survival of Th-MYCN mice, with drug treatment triggering splicing events and protein decreases consistent with in vitro data. Together our study demonstrates the PRMT5-dependent spliceosomal vulnerability of MNA neuroblastoma and identifies the epitranscriptome and glutamine metabolism as critical determinants of this sensitivity.","ABSTRACTThe SWI/SNF complex is a chromatin remodeling complex comprised by several proteins such as SMARCA4 or SMARCB1. Mutations in its components can lead to the development of aggressive rhabdoid tumors such as epithelioid sarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor or small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type, among others. These malignancies tend to affect young patients and their prognosis is poor given the lack of effective treatments. Characteristically, these tumors are highly infiltrated by TILs, suggesting that some lymphocytes are recognizing tumor antigens. The use of those TILs as a therapeutic strategy is a promising approach worth exploring. Here, we report the clinical protocol of the TILTS study, a Phase II clinical trial assessing personalized adoptive cell therapy with TILs in patients affected by these tumor types.Clinical Trial Registration: 2023-504632-17-00 ( (ClinicalTrials.gov).",0
"BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is characterized by abnormally fibrotic mesenchyme, which notably influences on the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Low-dose arsenic trioxide (ATO, 1.0 μM) can inhibit the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and affect fibrosis, which is a potential strategy for enhancing the sensitivity to immunotherapy.MethodsExtracellular matrix (ECM) models were employed to assess the regulatory effects of ATO on ECM and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Orthotopic C57BL/6J models were utilized to evaluate the influence of ATO on CD8+T cell infiltration and immunotherapy in PC. Additionally, nanomaterials loaded with ATO designed to specifically target PSCs (scAbFAP-α-HMSNs-PAA-ATO) were produced to enhance targeting effects of ATO.ResultsLow-dose ATO (1.0 μM) suppressed PSCs activation, exhibiting potential for synergistic immunotherapy. Under low-dose ATO intervention, ECM underwent remodeling, leading to increases in CD8+T cell infiltration, thereby enhancing anti-PD-L1 therapy effect. We further demonstrated that low-dose ATO remodeled ECM by regulating the expression of LOXL3 in PSCs. scAbFAP-α-HMSNs-PAA-ATO exhibited improved targeting capabilities, and enhanced capacity to inhibit fibrosis and sensitize immunotherapy.ConclusionsOur research reveals that low-dose ATO, by regulating LOXL3, remodels the ECM and enhances CD8+T cell infiltration, thus sensitizing the efficacy of immunotherapy, which provides a novel strategy for comprehensive treatment to PC.","In recent years, new treatments have become available which have improved survival rates in lung cancer patients. One promising treatment option is the rapidly growing field of oral targeted therapies, which employs drugs that interfere with specific molecules involved in the growth, progression, and spread of cancer. However, these therapies can cause a variety of symptoms and adverse events that can impair quality of life. mHealth technologies may help individuals with lung cancer better track their side effects and manage medications on a day-to-day basis. However, understanding patients’ attitudes toward smart devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, and smart pill bottles, as well as their specific needs when using these devices, is critical before design and deployment studies of medication adherence can be carried out. In this study, we conducted interviews with 9 individuals with stage III-IV lung cancer at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to assess the feasibility of using such devices for managing medication and medication related side-effects. We evaluated patients’ attitudes towards the design and function of smart devices and how these devices fit into their daily life. Our results may help clinicians and researchers to co-develop effective mHealth system deployments for side effect and medication management in oncology populations.",0
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is incurable and prone to widespread metastasis. Therefore, identification of key targets for TNBC progression is urgently needed. Our previous study revealed that isotoosendanin (ITSN) reduced TNBC metastasis by targeting TGFβR1. ITSN is currently used as an effective chemical probe to further discover the key molecules involved in TNBC metastasis downstream of TGFβR1. The results showed that GOT2 was the gene downstream of Smad2/3 and that ITSN decreased GOT2 expression by abrogating the activation of the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling pathway through directly binding to TGFβR1. GOT2 was highly expressed in TNBC, and its knockdown decreased TNBC metastasis. However, GOT2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of ITSN on TNBC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. GOT2 interacted with MYH9 and hindered its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1, thereby reducing MYH9 ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, GOT2 also enhanced the translocation of MYH9 to mitochondria and thus induced DRP1 phosphorylation, thereby promoting mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells. ITSN-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation was associated with reduced GOT2 expression. In conclusion, ITSN prevented MYH9-regulated mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells by enhancing MYH9 protein degradation through a reduction in GOT2 expression, thus contributing to its inhibition of TNBC metastasis.","AbstractBackgroundPreclinical cancer studies ascribe promising anticancer properties to metformin. Yet, clinical findings vary, casting uncertainty on its therapeutic value for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We hypothesized that metformin could benefit obese and overweight patients with NSCLC.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 2 clinical cohorts and employed complementary mouse models to test our hypothesis. One cohort included NSCLC patients with overweight body mass index (≥25 kg/m2, n = 511) and nonoverweight body mass index (<25 kg/m2, n = 232) who underwent lobectomy, evaluating metformin’s impact on clinical outcomes. Another cohort examined metformin’s effect on progression-free survival after immune checkpoint inhibitors in overweight (n = 284) vs nonoverweight (n = 184) NSCLC patients. Metformin’s effects on tumor progression, antitumor immunity, and immune checkpoint inhibitor response in obese and normal-weight mice were assessed with lung cancer models.ResultsMetformin is associated with increased recurrence-free survival in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.94; P = .035) after lobectomy. It also corrected accelerated tumor growth in diet-induced obese mouse models in a lymphocyte-specific manner while reversing several mechanisms of immune suppression potentiated by obesity. Programmed cell death 1 blockade coupled with metformin was more effective at limiting tumor burden in obese mice and correlated with progression-free survival only in overweight patients on immunotherapy (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.93; P = .024).ConclusionsMetformin may improve lung cancer–specific clinical outcomes in obese and overweight lung cancer patients and enhance immunotherapy efficacy in this growing population. This work identifies obesity as a potential predictive biomarker of metformin’s anticancer and immunotherapy-enhancing properties in lung cancer while shedding light on the underlying immunological phenomena.",0
"BackgroundPlatelets are essential for hemostasis, and thrombosis, and play vital roles during metastatic cancer progression and infection. Hallmarks of platelet function are activation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and the degranulation of their cellular contents upon stimulation. While alpha and dense granules are the most studied platelet secretory granules, the dense tubular system (DTS) also functions as a secretory system for vascular thiol isomerases. However, how DTS cargo is packaged and transported from megakaryocytes (MKs) to platelets is poorly understood.Objectives:To underpin the mechanisms responsible for DTS cargo transport and leverage those for therapeutic protein packaging into platelets.MethodsA retroviral expression system combined with immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was employed to track protein DTS cargo protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) fused to eGFP (eGFP-PDI) during platelet production. Murine bone marrow transplantation models were used to determine the release of therapeutic proteins from platelets.Results and conclusionsWe demonstrated that the endoplasmic reticulum retrieval motif Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) located at the C-terminus of PDI was essential for the regular transport of eGFP-PDI-containing granules. eGFP-PDIΔKDEL, in which the retrieval signal was deleted, was aberrantly packaged and its expression was upregulated within clathrin-coated endosomes. Finally, we found that ectopic transgenic proteins, such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor and interleukin 2, can be packaged into MKs and proplatelets by adding a KDEL retrieval sequence. Our data corroborate the DTS as a non-canonical secretory system in platelets and demonstrate that in vitro-generated MKs and platelets may be used as a delivery system for transgenic proteins during cellular therapy.","Background and aimAccording to previous reports, GTPase of immunity-associated protein 6 (GIMAP6) is essential for autophagy. However, it is unclear how GIMAP6 affects the development and tumor immunity of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).MethodsIn the present study, the role of GIMAP6 in vivo and in vitro was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting, and Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and Transwell assays. Datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were thoroughly analyzed using R software. A nomogram was created using GIMAP6 and prognostic characteristics. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were applied to explore the potential mechanism of GIMAP6 in lung cancer. The link between GIMAP6 and the immunological landscape was studied using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0 and Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub.ResultsPatients with high GIMAP6 expression had improved overall and disease-specific survival compared with those patients with low GIMAP6 expression. According to the receiver operating characteristic and calibration curve, the nomogram based on T stage, N stage and GIMAP6 had predictive value for prognosis. According to functional enrichment analysis, GIMAP6 was primarily involved in T-cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction. GIMAP6 was shown to be favorably linked with the infiltration of immune cells and immune-related molecules, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, programmed death-ligand 1, and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, by single-cell sequencing and TIMER2.0 analysis. The role of GIMAP6 in lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and immunity was experimentally verified.ConclusionThese findings confirmed that GIMAP6 was an effective prognostic molecule that was involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment of LUAD, and may become a predictor for the efficacy of immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04980-z.",0
"The advancements in the detection and characterization of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have revolutionized precision medicine and are likely to transform standard clinical practice. The non‐invasive nature of this approach allows for molecular profiling of the entire tumor entity, while also enabling real‐time monitoring of the effectiveness of cancer therapies as well as the identification of resistance mechanisms to guide targeted therapy. Although the field of ctDNA studies offers a wide range of applications, including in early disease, in this review we mainly focus on the role of ctDNA in the dynamic molecular characterization of unresectable locally advanced and metastatic BC (mBC). Here, we provide clinical practice guidance for the rapidly evolving field of molecular profiling of mBC, outlining the current landscape of liquid biopsy applications and how to choose the right ctDNA assay. Additionally, we underline the importance of exploring the clinical relevance of novel molecular alterations that potentially represent therapeutic targets in mBC, along with mutations where targeted therapy is already approved. Finally, we present a potential roadmap for integrating ctDNA analysis into clinical practice.","Selective RNA delivery is required for the broad implementation of RNA clinical applications, including prophylactic and therapeutic vaccinations, immunotherapies for cancer, and genome editing. Current polyanion delivery relies heavily on cationic amines, while cationic guanidinium systems have received limited attention due in part to their strong polyanion association, which impedes intracellular polyanion release. Here, we disclose a general solution to this problem in which cationic guanidinium groups are used to form stable RNA complexes upon formulation but at physiological pH undergo a novel charge-neutralization process, resulting in RNA release. This new delivery system consists of guanidinylated serinol moieties incorporated into a charge-altering releasable transporter (GSer-CARTs). Significantly, systematic variations in structure and formulation resulted in GSer-CARTs that exhibit highly selective mRNA delivery to the lung (∼97%) and spleen (∼98%) without targeting ligands. Illustrative of their breadth and translational potential, GSer-CARTs deliver circRNA, providing the basis for a cancer vaccination strategy, which in a murine model resulted in antigen-specific immune responses and effective suppression of established tumors.",0
"Circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary strategy in cancer immunotherapy, facilitating novel approaches to induce robust and durable immune responses. Unlike traditional linear messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development. This review delved into the fundamental principles underlying circRNA biology, highlighting their unique structural advantages and translational potential. We examined recent advancements in circRNA vaccine design, focusing on their application in oncology. As the circRNA-based cancer vaccine is a relatively novel technology, findings from all the major studies describing its efficacy were discussed. We further investigated their combination with other immunotherapeutic modalities, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies, that ensure the maximal anticancer effects of circRNA vaccines. Large-scale manufacturing, immunogenicity optimization, delivery systems, and other challenges and future directions in this field were also discussed. This study aims to thoroughly analyze the state-of-the-art and potential future applications of circRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy, highlighting them as exciting possibilities for next-generation cancer therapies.","Antibodies targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD1) and its ligand (PDL1) have transformed current cancer therapy while little is known about the expression of anti-PD1/PDL1 autoantibodies between lung cancer (LC) patients and normal controls (NC). The expression level of anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG and IgM was detected in plasma of 325 LC and 324 NC by indirect enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) were used to verify the ELISA results. The association analysis was used to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) of LC. The expression of anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG in LC samples was significantly higher than NC (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). The positive rate of anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG in LC was significantly higher than NC and significant difference was also shown in LC samples of different clinical characteristics, such as clinical stage, nodules diameter, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Moreover, PD1/PDL1 expression in tissues showed no significant relation with that in plasma (P > 0.05). Anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG were the risk factors related to LC (OR (95% CI): 22.433 (5.426–92.745) and 5.051 (1.316–19.386)), while anti-PD1/PDL1 IgM were the risk factors for LC with ≤ 60 years (OR (95% CI): 6.122 (1.365–27.455) and 7.664 (1.715–34.251)) and anti-PD1 IgM was also the risk factor for male LC cases(OR (95% CI): 6.948 (1.076–44.868)).

"With improved systemic treatment and prolonged survival even with metastatic disease, diagnosing, treating, and monitoring brain metastases has become a central topic in the care of patients with melanoma. Patients with brain metastases from melanoma are typically excluded from pivotal clinical trials. When allowed, inclusion and exclusion criteria are rather selective and do not reflect the larger population of melanoma patients with brain metastases who frequently present with neurological symptoms and signs and require steroid medications. Moreover, the lack of consensus on reporting symptomatic brain involvement complicates the interpretation and implications of trial results for the overall population of patients with melanoma and brain metastasis. Here, we review the evidence regarding brain metastasis from melanoma and discuss the challenges of longitudinal neurological clinical assessments, including tools to capture cognition and quality of life. Finally, we propose the adoption of standardized tools to interpret neurological deficits in patients with melanoma and brain metastases and to assess the neurological status in the context of clinical trials.","PurposeTo determine whether TCF-1+PD-1+CD8+T cells are associated with the response to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.MethodsWe investigated the expression of TCF-1+PD-1+CD8+T cells and elucidated their predictive role in NSCLC patients. Pretreatment specimens from 20 advanced NSCLC patients who underwent PD-1 immunotherapy or combined with chemotherapy were analyzed. The frequencies of TCF-1+ cells in PD-1+CD8+T cells were determined in these biospecimens using multi-label immunofluorescence staining and multi-spectral acquisition technology. The clinical roles of TCF-1+PD-1+CD8+T cells were assessed via analyzing our cases and human NSCLC data collected from public databases.ResultsA high frequency of TCF-1+PD-1+CD8+T cells was identified in responders compared with non-responders (p = 0.0024), and the patients with high expression of this cell subset had durable clinical benefit of anti-PD-1 therapy. There were no significant association between the expression of TCF-1+PD-1+CD8+T cells and patients’ age, smoking history, pathologic type, and genetic status. In univariate analysis by the Cox hazard model, high frequency of TCF-1+ PD-1+ CD8+T cells was significantly correlated with patients’ benefit of PD-1 blockade (p = 0.024).ConclusionOur study indicated that TCF-1+PD-1+CD8+T cells are associated with the response to PD-1 blockade, and may be a predictor of anti-PD-1 therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03845-7.",1
"PurposeIn the complex tumor scenario, understanding the function of proteins with protumor or antitumor roles is essential to support advances in the cancer clinical area. Among them, the salvador family WW domain-containing protein 1 (SAV1) is highlighted. This protein plays a fundamental role in the tumor suppressor face of the Hippo pathway, which are responsible for controlling cell proliferation, organ size, development and tissue homeostasis. However, the functional dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. As SAV1 is a tumor suppressor scaffold protein, we explored the functions performed by SAV1 with its partners, the regulation of its expression, and its antitumor role in various types of cancer.MethodsWe selected and analyzed 80 original articles and reviews from Pubmed that focuses on the study of SAV1 in cancer.ResultsSAV1 interacts with several proteins, has different functions and acts as tumor suppressor by other mechanisms besides Hippo pathway. SAV1 expression regulation seems to occur by microRNAs and rarely by mutation or promoter methylation. It is downregulated in different types of cancer, which leads to cancer promotion and progression and is associated with poor prognosis. In vivo models have shown that the loss of SAV1 contributes to tumorigenesis.ConclusionSAV1 plays a relevant role as tumor suppressor in several types of cancer, highlighting SAV1 and the Hippo pathway's importance to cancer. Thus, encouraging further studies to include the SAV1 as a molecular key piece in cancer biology and in clinical approaches to cancer.","BackgroundThe optimal timing of transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still under debate regarding the tumor biology and locoregional control with various treatments. We designed this study to find out what kind of factors affect the post-transplantation outcome focusing on the timing of transplantation.MethodsWe analyzed HCC patients who met the Milan criteria at the initial stage and subsequently underwent liver transplantation (LT) between 2007 and 2020. We examined the number of locoregional therapies (LRTs) received, as well as data on tumor recurrence and survival. The number of LRTs was categorized into four groups: none, one or two, three or four, and five or more. Both recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed.ResultsA total of 423 patients who met the Milan criteria at the initial stage underwent LT. The median number of LRTs before transplantation was 2, with an interquartile range of 0 to 4. There were 112 patients (26.5%) who underwent LT as the initial treatment. Multivariable Cox analyses showed that the number of LRTs [hazard ratio (HR) =1.219, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.074–1.382, P=0.002] was a significant factor for recurrence. When analyzed as a categorical variable, three or four LRTs (HR =4.936, 95% CI: 1.790–13.615, P=0.002) and five or more LRTs (HR =5.129, 95% CI: 1.958–13.440, P=0.001) showed a significantly higher risk compared to the primary transplantation group.ConclusionsThis study showed that the risk of recurrence after transplantation increases with the increasing number of LRTs prior to LT. Therefore, optimal timing of LT should be cautiously decided in regards of recurrence potential of each patient.",0
"PurposeSelinexor is a novel XPO1 inhibitor which inhibits the export of tumor suppressor proteins and oncoprotein mRNAs, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. While selinexor is currently FDA approved to treat multiple myeloma, compelling preclinical and early clinical studies reveal selinexor’s efficacy in treating hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, including sarcoma, gastric, bladder, prostate, breast, ovarian, skin, lung, and brain cancers. Current reviews of selinexor primarily highlight its use in hematologic malignancies; however, this review seeks to summarize the recent evidence of selinexor treatment in solid tumors.MethodsPertinent literature searches in PubMed and the Karyopharm Therapeutics website for selinexor and non-hematologic malignancies preclinical and clinical trials.ResultsThis review provides evidence that selinexor is a promising agent used alone or in combination with other anticancer medications in non-hematologic malignancies.ConclusionFurther clinical investigation of selinexor treatment for solid malignancies is warranted.","Although significant advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer (BC) in recent years, BC remains the most common cancer in women and one of the main causes of death among women worldwide. Currently, more than half of BC patients have no known risk factors, emphasizing the significance of identifying more tumor-related factors. Therefore, we urgently need to find new therapeutic strategies to improve prognosis. Increasing evidence demonstrates that the microbiota is present in a wider range of cancers beyond colorectal cancer. BC and breast tissues also have different types of microbiotas that play a key role in carcinogenesis and in modulating the efficacy of anticancer treatment, for instance, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. In recent years, studies have confirmed that the microbiota can be an important factor directly and/or indirectly affecting the occurrence, metastasis and treatment of BC by regulating different biological processes, such as estrogen metabolism, DNA damage, and bacterial metabolite production. Here, we review the different microbiota-focused studies associated with BC and explore the mechanisms of action of the microbiota in BC initiation and metastasis and its application in various therapeutic strategies. We found that the microbiota has vital clinical value in the diagnosis and treatment of BC and could be used as a biomarker for prognosis prediction. Therefore, modulation of the gut microbiota and its metabolites might be a potential target for prevention or therapy in BC.",0
"With expansion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and broader utilization of anti-cytokine directed therapeutics for toxicity mitigation, the routine assessment of cytokines may enhance understanding of toxicity profiles, guide therapeutic interventions, and facilitate cross-trial comparisons. As specific cytokine elevations can correlate with and provide insights into CAR T cell toxicity, mitigation strategies, and response, we explored the reporting of cytokine detection methods and assessed for the correlation of cytokines to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) across clinical trials. In this analysis, we reviewed 21 clinical trials across 60 manuscripts that featured a US Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR T cell construct or one of its predecessors. We highlight substantial variability and limited reporting of cytokine measurement platforms and panels used across CAR T cell clinical trials. Specifically, across 60 publications, 28 (46.7%) did not report any cytokine data, representing 6 of 21 (28.6%) clinical trials. In the 15 trials reporting cytokine data, at least 4 different platforms were used. Furthermore, correlation of cytokines with ICANS, CRS, and CRS severity was limited. Considering the fundamental role of cytokines in CAR T cell toxicity, our manuscript supports the need to establish standardization of cytokine measurements as a key biomarker essential to improving outcomes of CAR T cell therapy.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become an indispensable part of clinical practice; however, off-label use of these agents is unknown. We aimed to define the patterns of off-label use of ICIs in a nationwide sample of patients.MethodsThe online database (Reçetem) was retrospectively searched for off-label use cases related to ICIs approved during a 6-month period. Adult patients with metastatic solid tumors were included. Ethics approval was obtained. Reasons for off-label use were recorded in eight categories and cases were assessed for adherence to current guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed with GNU PSPP version 1.5.3.ResultsFive hundred seventy-seven reasons for use were recorded for 538 cases related to 527 patients (67.5% male). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (35.9%) was the most common cancer type. Nivolumab (49%), pembrolizumab (25.5%), and atezolizumab (25%) were commonly used. The top reason for off-label use was lack of approval for the cancer type (37.1%), followed by use beyond the approved treatment line (21%). Nivolumab was more frequently used than atezolizumab and/or pembrolizumab in patients with malignant melanoma, kidney cancer, head and neck cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, p < 0.001). The guideline adherence rate was 60.5%.ConclusionOff-label use of ICIs was primarily related to (NSCLC), and most patients were treatment-naïve in contrast to the acceptance that off-label use results from exhausted treatment options. Lack of approval is a significant reason for the off-label use of ICIs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04803-1.",0
"BackgroundThe choice between immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) and chemo-/immunotherapy (CIT) in patients with NSCLC stage IV is often discussed. There are some data that the effect of CPI therapy is impaired by antimicrobial therapy (AMT). Little is known about the influence of AMT on CIT.Patients and methodsWe retrospectively analysed 114 patients (age 68 ± 8.5 years) with NSCLC stage IV. Patients were treated according to the guidelines with either CPI alone (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, cemiplimab) or CIT (Carboplatin/Pemetrexed/Pembrolizumab, Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Pembrolizumab). We registered patients’ characteristics including presence and timing of AMT. Group 1 consisted of 42 patients with AMT in the month before CPI or CIT, group 2 were 49 patients with AMT during CPI or CIT, and group 3 were 64 patients without AMT and CPI or CIT.ResultsGroup 1–3 showed comparable patients characteristics. Using cox-regression analysis, we found that AMT in the month before CPI resulted in a decreased progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients with CPI and no AMT (14 ± 1.02 vs. 4 ± 1.02 months, p = 0.002, 95% CI 1.88–9). In patients, who were treated with CIT, there was no difference in PFS in those with or without AMT in the month before therapy (10 ± 2.5 vs. 6 ± 1.2 months, p = 0.7). Interestingly, AMT during CIT or CPI therapy showed no effect on PFS.ConclusionsIn a real-life setting, we found that AMT reduces PFS when given in the month before CIT therapy. AMT before or during CIT does not seem to influence PFS. As a consequence, AMT before start of therapy might be a factor that could lead to a preference of CIT instead of CPI in NSCLC stage IV patients.","AbstractBACKGROUNDGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain malignancy in adults. Standard of care (SOC) for suspected GBM begins with maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and maintenance temozolomide. Imvax has utilized its Goldspire™ platform to create IGV-001, an autologous biologic-device combination product for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM). IGV-001 consists of autologous GBM tumor cells and an antisense oligonucleotide against IGF-1R mRNA (IMV-001), irradiated and administered via biodiffusion chambers implanted in the abdomen. Together, these components stimulate immunogenic cell death and antigen release. In a phase 1b study in patients with ndGBM, IGV-001 was well tolerated without unexpected adverse events. Multiple efficacy signals were also observed, including significant improvements in progression-free survival, overall survival, radiographic evidence of tumor response, and changes in immune response biomarkers. A phase 2b randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of IGV-001 in patients with ndGBM (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04485949) is ongoing. Here, we present the first safety data from the study.MATERIAL AND METHODSAfter surgical resection, patients are treated with IGV-001 or placebo followed by SOC. The study will enroll approximately 93 patients at 20 sites in the United States, with a 2:1 randomization favoring IGV-001. The primary outcome is progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to first progression, as determined by blinded central radiology review, or death. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause, and safety.RESULTSAs of February 2, 2024, a total of 72 patients have been randomized and 69 have been implanted with IGV-001 or placebo plus SOC. The median age was 60.0 years (range, 24-70 years). Most randomized patients (76.4%) were 51-70 years of age, and the male:female ratio was 2.27. A total of 39/45 (86.7%) patients with enough follow-up time, initiated treatment with concurrent radiation and temozolomide. A total of 9/72 (12.5%) randomized patients discontinued treatment, including 7 patients who discontinued during the SOC treatment period. No patients discontinued treatment for adverse events, protocol deviations, or death. A total of 11/72 (15.3%) randomized patients discontinued the study after randomization.CONCLUSIONTo date, the review of blinded safety data did not show any emerging risk and supports that there is no change to the benefit-risk profile of treatment with IGV-001 versus placebo. The data will be updated before presentation.",0
"AbstractObjectivesBreast sensation following autologous breast reconstruction impacts patients’ quality of life. Although spontaneous reinnervation in free flaps was documented by many authors, there are efforts to further improve restoration of breast sensation. Interestingly, animal studies indicated that trastuzumab has several beneficial effects on transected peripheral nerves. Our aim was to compare spontaneous sensory recovery after free TRAM flap breast reconstruction between patients who were and were not treated with trastuzumab.MethodsThe study included 14 subjects who underwent tactile sensation examination in 5-year period after noninnervated free muscle-sparing TRAM flap breast reconstruction at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. Small and large flap skin islands and contralateral healthy breasts were tested with Semmes-Weinstein type monofilaments. Three sensory scores were created to more accurately compare breast sensation.ResultsIn subjects receiving trastuzumab, sensory recovery earlier extended to at least four of five large skin island regions and was always present in the central flap area in comparison with subjects who were not administered trastuzumab (p=0.0476). As indicated by total sensory scores, trastuzumab-treated subjects restored sensation better resembling healthy control breasts (54 vs. 39 % in large skin islands; 95 vs. 71 % in small skin islands).ConclusionsTo the authors’ knowledge, the current study for the first time demonstrated trastuzumab’s potential to improve sensory outcomes in human. Our results support the strategy that accelerated nerve regeneration is a key to more successful reinnervation. HER2 and EGFR inhibitors emerge as new candidates for pharmacological interventions in peripheral nerve injury treatment.","PurposeEarly biochemical recurrence (eBCR) indicated a high risk for potential recurrence and metastasis in prostate cancer. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification played an important role in prostate cancer progression. This study aimed to develop a m6A lncRNA signature to accurately predict eBCR in prostate cancer.MethodsPearson correlation analysis was first conducted to explore m6A lncRNAs and univariate Cox regression analysis was further performed to identify m6A lncRNAs of prognostic roles for predicting eBCR in prostate cancer. The m6A lncRNA signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis (LASSO) in training cohort and further validated in test cohort. Furthermore, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were utilized to explore potential effective drugs for high-risk group in this study.ResultsFive hundred and thirty-eighth m6A lncRNAs were searched out through Pearson correlation analysis and 25 out of 538 m6A lncRNAs were identified to pose prediction roles for eBCR in prostate cancers. An m6A lncRNA signature including 5 lncRNAs was successfully built in training cohort. The high-risk group derived from m6A lncRNA signature could efficiently predict eBCR occurrence in both training (p < 0.001) and test cohort (p = 0.002). ROC analysis also confirmed that lncRNA signature in this study posed more accurate prediction roles for eBCR occurrence when compared with PSA, TNM stages and Gleason scores. Drug sensitivity analysis further discovered that various drugs could be potentially utilized to treat high-risk samples in this study. ConclusionsThe m6A lncRNA signature in this study could be utilized to efficiently predict eBCR occurrence, various clinical characteristic and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04040-y.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, but they can induce immune-related adverse events, including immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonia (CIP), a severe lung complication. CIP, particularly Grades 3–4, is associated with poor prognosis, indicating a critical need for research on this issue. Our study aimed to investigate the risk factors and biomarkers associated with severe CIP in lung cancer patients treated with ICIs, where OS represents overall survival and PFS denotes progression-free survival.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 106 lung cancer patients with CIP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 2019 to 2023, categorized into four severity grades.ResultsThe median time to onset of CIP was 5.17 months. Patients with Grade 3–4 CIP had a median PFS of 6.5 months and OS of 11.2 months. Univariate analysis identified phosphocreatine kinase below 61.5 U/l, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) below 1.96, and BMI below 21.26 as predictive factors for Grades 3–4 CIP. Multivariate analysis confirmed that a decreased FVC was a significant predictor.ConclusionsA decreased FVC below 1.96 emerged as a predictive factor for Grades 3–4 CIP, highlighting the importance of monitoring FVC in patients receiving ICIs.","Asthma is a descriptive label for an obstructive inflammatory disease in the lower airways manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing. From a clinician’s point of view, asthma symptoms can commence at any age, although most patients with asthma—regardless of their age of onset—seem to have had some form of airway problems during childhood. Asthma inception and related pathophysiologic processes are therefore very likely to occur early in life, further evidenced by recent lung physiologic and mechanistic research. Herein, we present state-of-the-art updates on the role of genetics and epigenetics, early viral and bacterial infections, immune response, and pathophysiology, as well as lifestyle and environmental exposures, in asthma across the life course. We conclude that early environmental insults in genetically vulnerable individuals inducing abnormal, pre-asthmatic airway responses are key events in asthma inception, and we highlight disease heterogeneity across ages and the potential shortsightedness of treating all patients with asthma using the same treatments. Although there are no interventions that, at present, can modify long-term outcomes, a precision-medicine approach should be implemented to optimize treatment and tailor follow-up for all patients with asthma.",1
"AbstractProstate cancer (PCa) has become a common disease among middle-aged and elderly men. The lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway plays a crucial role in the occurrence, development, invasion and metastasis of PCa and is therefore considered a new target for the prevention and treatment of PCa. 5-LOX and 12-LOX have a promoting effect on the occurrence, development, invasion and metastasis of PCa. 15-LOX-2 has an inhibitory effect on PCa. LOX inhibitors can effectively inhibit the metabolic activity of LOX. The research aims to review the mechanism of action and inhibitors of LOX in PCa, in order to provide relevant references for the prevention and treatment of PCa.","Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer (PC). Tryptophan oxidative catabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) cleaves the indole ring to kynurenine (Kyn), an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which activates multiple tumorigenesis pathways. The IDO1-Kyn-AhR axis is aberrantly dysregulated in mCRPC. (−)-Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid. CBD showed antitumor activities against human malignancies, including PC. CBD showed potent in vitro dose-dependent reduction of viability and clonogenicity of diverse human PC cell lines. CBD reduced the expression of IDO1 and AhR in PC cells. A daily 15 mg/kg oral dose of CBD for 30 days effectively suppressed the progression of the mCRPC CWR-R1ca-Luc cells xenografted in male nude mice. Continued CBD oral dosing for an additional 45 days suppressed the CWR-R1ca-Luc tumor locoregional and distant recurrences after the primary tumors’ surgical excision. Collected CBD-treated tumors showed a reduced level of IDO1 expression. CBD-treated mice displayed a significant systemic reduction of Kyn. CBD is a novel, nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid lead useful for the control of mCRPC via targeting the tryptophan catabolism.",1
"Cervical Cancer prevention is a relatively new concept in Medicine. Since mid-twentieth century, diagnosis of Precancerous phase became possible thus outcome of invasive cervical cancer could be avoided. The dawn of this new era began with the research on HPV infection, being the causative factor. Clinical use of vaccines made it possible to start primary prevention by the year 2006. There has been a paradigm shift in this field and some of the important shifts will be discussed. The 1st paradigm is to better understand “Cancer Prevention”. Cytology or the “Pap Smear” as it is commonly known is a simple low cost, low technology test. Combining it with biomarker test gives it more validity. Angiogenesis of cervical neoplasia was based on colposcopy. Angiogenesis inhibitor was discovered on this concept which improved treatment results. Incidence and mortality of cervical cancer shows a global disparity. For this, we have to study the social determinants. Some of the causes leading to high mortality are delay in diagnosis and reaching healthcare facility. UN’s SD goal has suggested 30% reduction to be achieved. HPV is the cause of many other cancers apart from cervical cancer which may lead to suffering and mortality. The most deadly genotypes of HPV are 9 which form the NONAVALENT Vaccine. Introduction of vaccine made in India may be a game changer. A new “Ray of Hope” was the introduction of therapeutic vaccines in 2020. It will reduce human suffering and prolong life. As research advances, many more new Paradigms will evolve.","BackgroundNecroptosis has been linked to the development of tumors. Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been identified as having a major role in numerous biological and pathological procedures. Despite this, the precise role that necroptosis-related lncRNAs (NRLs) have in cervical cancer (CC) and their potential for predicting its prognosis is still to a large extent unclear.MethodsGene expression RNA-sequencing data, mutational data, and clinical profiles for 309 CC patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The NRLs were then identified with Pearson correlation analysis followed by splitting of the patients into training and validation sets in a 3:2 ratio. Cox and LASSO regression models were performed to construct a cervical cancer prognostic signature based on NRLs. This 5-NRLs signature was then verified by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and nomogram for prognostic prediction. Further, a correlation study between the risk score (RS) and immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint molecules, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and the sensitivity of chemotherapy drug was conducted. To validate the 5-NRLs, a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was finally performed.ResultsThe 5-NRLs signature was designed to accurately predict the prognosis of CC. It consists of AC092153.1, AC007686.3, LINC01281, AC009097.2, and RUSC1-AS1 and was found to be highly predictive using ROC and Kaplan–Meier curves. Furthermore, when analyzed through stratified survival analysis, it was confirmed to be an independent risk factor for prognosis. The nomogram and calibration curves further validated its clinical utility. Moreover, distinct differences between two risk groups were observed when examining immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint molecules, somatic gene alterations and half-inhibitory concentration of anticancer drug.ConclusionsThe 5-NRLs signature is a novel and valuable tool for evaluating the prognosis of CC patients, providing clinicians with an informed decision-making framework to formulate tailored treatment plans for their patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05158-3.",1
"AbstractBackground:Neoadjuvant therapy enhances the possibility of achieving radical resection and improves the prognosis for locally advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal extent of resection for locally advanced proximal GC after neoadjuvant therapy.Methods:In this study, 330 patients underwent resection in Peking University Cancer Hospital, with curative intent after neoadjuvant therapy for histologically confirmed proximal GC from January 2009 to December 2022.Results:In this study, 45 patients underwent proximal gastrectomy (PG), while 285 underwent total gastrectomy (TG). After propensity-score matching, 110 patients (71 TG and 39 PG) were included in the analysis. No significant differences between PG and TG regarding short-term outcomes and long-term prognosis were found. Specifically, PG demonstrated comparable overall survival to TG (P = 0.47). Subgroup analysis revealed that although not statistically significant, PG showed a potential advantage over TG in overall survival for patients with tumor-long diameters less than 4 cm (P = 0.31). However, for those with a long diameter larger than 4 cm, TG had a better survival probability (P = 0.81). No substantial differences were observed in baseline characteristics, surgical safety, postoperative recovery, and postoperative complications.Conclusion:For locally advanced proximal GC with objective response to neoadjuvant therapy (long diameter <4 cm), PG is an alternative surgical procedure.","PurposeNeoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection is one of the preferred treatment option for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients with mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) factor exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutations, the use of MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed high efficiency and reduced toxicity compared with first-line standard chemotherapy. However, it is unknown whether preoperative induction targeted therapy of MET-TKIs is feasible and safe.MethodsHere, we reported 3 cases of locally advanced unresectable NSCLC with METex14 mutations receiving induction therapy of MET-TKI savolitinib as first-line therapy or second-line therapy when they experienced disease progression after preoperative chemotherapy.ResultsAll these 3 patients achieved significant tumor size shrinkage and their unresectable tumors became resectable after the treatment of savolitinib. No serious adverse events were observed during the treatment. They recovered well postoperatively, and no significant events were identified.ConclusionsPreoperative induction treatment with MET-TKI savolitinib showed its safety and effectiveness and may be an alternative option for neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC patients with METex14 mutations.",1
"BackgroundCancer metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, underscoring the importance of understanding its underlying mechanisms. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly malignant type of cancer, was selected as our research model.Material and methodsWe aimed to develop high-metastatic cell lines using in vitro and in vivo selection strategies and identify critical metastasis-related genes through microarray analyses by comparing them with parental cells.ResultsOur results showed that the high-metastatic cell lines exhibited significantly stronger invasion abilities than parental cells. Microarray analyses identified cytidine deaminase (CDA), a gene associated with systemic chemotherapy resistance, as one of the overexpressed genes in the high-metastatic cells. Data analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program revealed that while CDA is downregulated in HCC, patients with high CDA expression tend to have poorer prognoses. Cell models confirmed that CDA overexpression enhances cell migration and invasion, whereas CDA knockdown inhibits these abilities. Investigating the key molecules involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we found that CDA overexpression increases the expression of fascin, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and snail while decreasing E-cadherin expression. Conversely, CDA knockdown produced opposite results. Additionally, we discovered that CDA regulates NF-κB signaling, which controls the expression of N-cadherin, thereby promoting the invasion capability of HCC cells.ConclusionsWe isolated highly metastatic cells and identified potential HCC metastasis-related genes. CDA promotes cell invasion by regulating EMT through the NF-κB pathway. Future studies are warranted to explore the potential of CDA as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic decision-making.","PurposeRecent studies have revealed that primary tumor resection (PTR) surgery could improve prognosis in some solid tumors. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether patients with stage IVB cervical carcinoma can benefit from PTR surgery and who can benefit.MethodsWe extracted and obtained data on patients with stage IVB cervical carcinoma from the SEER database from 2010 to 2017 and classified them into two groups: the surgery and the non-surgery group. The overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of the two groups were compared before and after propensity score matching (PSM). The independent prognostic variables were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Then, the model was established to select the optimal patients to receive PTR surgery using multivariate logistic regression.ResultsAfter PSM, the study included 476 cervical carcinoma (stage IVB) patients, of whom 238 underwent PTR surgery. Compared to the non-surgery group, the surgery group’s median OS and median CSS were both longer (median OS: 27 months vs. 13 months, P < 0.001; median CSS: 52 months vs. 21 months, P < 0.001). The model showed no organ metastasis, adenocarcinoma, G1/2, and chemotherapy were more supportive of performing PTR surgery. The calibration curves and DCA showed that the model had high predictive accuracy and excellent clinical applicability. Finally, the “surgery benefit” group had the OS that was approximately four times better than “surgery non-benefit” group.ConclusionPTR surgery can potentially improve the prognosis of patients with cervical carcinoma at stage IVB. The model could probably select optimal candidates and provide a new perspective on individualized treatment.",1
"BackgroundB7-H3 is a cell surface immunomodulatory glycoprotein overexpressed in prostate cancers (PC). Understanding its longitudinal expression at emergence of castration-resistance, and association with tumour genomics, is critical to the development of and patient selection for B7-H3 targeted therapies.ObjectiveTo characterize B7-H3 expression in same-patient, castration-sensitive PC (CSPC) and castration-resistant PC (CRPC) biopsies, associating this with PC genomics, and to evaluate the antitumour activity of an anti-B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in human CRPC in vitro and in vivo.Design, setting, and participantsWe performed IHC and next generation sequencing on a cohort of 98 clinically annotated, CRPC biopsies, among which 72 patients had CSPC biopsies for analyses. We analysed two CRPC transcriptome and exome datasets. PC organoids (PDX-Os) were derived from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generated from human CRPC biopsies.Outcome measurementsWe evaluated B7-H3 mRNA expression in relation to a panel of 770 immune-related genes; compared B7-H3 protein expression between same-patient CSPC and CRPC biopsies; determined associations with PC genomic alterations; evaluated the antitumour activity of DS-7300a, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor payload anti-B7-H3 ADC, in human PC cell lines, organoids and xenografts of different histologies, B7-H3 expressions, and genomics.Results and limitationsB7-H3 was one of the most highly expressed immunomodulatory genes in CRPCs. Most CSPCs (97%) and CRPCs (93%) expressed B7-H3 and conversion from B7-H3 positive to negative, or vice versa, during progression from CSPC to CRPC was rare. B7-H3 is overexpressed in tumours with defective DNA repair (DDR) gene (ATM, BRCA1/2) alterations compared to tumours without DDR gene alteration. DS7300a had antitumour activity against B7-H3 expressing human PC models including cell lines, PDX-Os and PDXs of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine histology.ConclusionsB7-H3 is overexpressed in the majority of PCs, especially DDR defective tumours. B7-H3 positive CRPC may be targeted with an anti-B7-H3 ADC.Patient summaryB7-H3, a protein expressed on the surface of most lethal PC, and in particular those with specific mutations, can be targeted using drugs that bind B7-H3 and carry potent chemotherapies. These drugs are being evaluated in cancer patients.","AbstractIntroductionTreatment for relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis (AL) is an unmet need. The safety and efficacy of belantamab mafodotin (BLM) in multiple myeloma are known, whereas in AL data are limited.MethodsWe report a multi-center cohort of AL patients receiving BLM, and review all previous data on BLM therapy in AL.ResultsTwelve patients with a median of 3 (range 2–9) prior lines of therapy were included. The overall hematological response rate (ORR) was 75% (9/12), including 5 complete responses. Six of the 10 evaluable patients had organ responses. The median event-free survivals/overall survivals were 22.3 and 28.8 months, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities were mostly infections and keratopathy, occurring in 7/12 (58%). Hematological toxicities were rare. No grade 4/5 toxicities occurred. The review of the previous series reveals BLM provides an ORR of 60–83% with similar rates of corneal toxicity.ConclusionBLM, being an off-the-shelf therapy, with acceptable toxicity even in frail patients, may be a valuable option in AL, with a high ORR, and a signal for durable responses and high-quality organ responses.",1
"ABSTRACTCholesterol serves as a vital lipid that regulates numerous physiological processes. Nonetheless, its role in regulating cell death processes remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of cholesterol trafficking in immunogenic cell death. Through cell-based drug screening, we identified two antidepressants, sertraline and indatraline, as potent inducers of the nuclear translocation of TFEB (transcription factor EB). Activation of TFEB was mediated through the autophagy-independent lipidation of MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3). Both compounds promoted cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes, resulting in lysosomal membrane permeabilization, disruption of autophagy and cell death that could be reversed by cholesterol depletion. Molecular docking analysis indicated that sertraline and indatraline have the potential to inhibit cholesterol binding to the lysosomal cholesterol transporters, NPC1 (NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1) and NPC2. This inhibitory effect might be further enhanced by the upregulation of NPC1 and NPC2 expression by TFEB. Both antidepressants also upregulated PLA2G15 (phospholipase A2 group XV), an enzyme that elevates lysosomal cholesterol. In cancer cells, sertraline and indatraline elicited immunogenic cell death, converting dying cells into prophylactic vaccines that were able to confer protection against tumor growth in mice. In a therapeutic setting, a single dose of each compound was sufficient to significantly reduce the outgrowth of established tumors in a T-cell-dependent manner. These results identify sertraline and indatraline as immunostimulatory agents for cancer treatment. More generally, this research shed light on novel therapeutic avenues harnessing lysosomal cholesterol transport to regulate immunogenic cell death.Abbreviation: ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG13: autophagy related 13; DKO: double knockout; ICD: immunogenic cell death; KO: knockout; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; LGALS3: galectin 3; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; LMP: lysosomal membrane permeabilization; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MTX: mitoxantrone; NPC1: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1; NPC2: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2; TFE3: transcription factor E3; TFEB: transcription factor EB; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.","A larger percentage of our population is aging healthily and living on to a ripe old age. 60 years of age is taken as cut-off for identifying geriatric population for the purpose of specialized healthcare. The incidence of cancer is increasing and its expected more so in the geriatric population. At present , there are a limited cancer centres where specialized geriatric clinic is being conducted.Some of the the key unmet needs are — lack of resources and time for dedicated geriatric screening, lack of validated interventions and lack of awareness about the field of geriatric oncology. Some of the proposed solutions are increasing orientation and exposure of trainees and early career oncologists as well as carrying out country specific research to find useful interventions in this field.",1
"BackgroundGallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare malignant tumour of the bile duct. Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations in the early stage, it is basically at an advanced stage when discovered. Radical resection remains the only curative therapy for patients with GBC. The resection rate is relatively low due to tumour invasion and metastasis, and the overall prognosis is poor. For most patients with unresectable lesions, chemotherapy has been the only recommended treatment for decades. Immunotherapy combined with TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) was proven to be effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Some physicians have attempted to apply immunotherapy and TKIs combined with traditional chemotherapy in patients with advanced GBC. However, the outcomes were not clear because limited cases were reported.Case presentationWe present a case series of four elderly patients with advanced GBC who received tislelizumab and lenvatinib combined with chemotherapy. All four patients responded to this treatment approach. Tumour responses were better in Patient 1 (TMB-H, MSS), Patient 2 (low TMB, MSS), and Patient 3 (low TMB, MSI-H) than in Patient 4 (low TMB, MSS), in whom metastasis occurred during the later stage of treatment.ConclusionThe combination of tislelizumab and lenvatinib may be a promising treatment for patients with advanced GBC. The efficacy and safety need further confirmation.","ABSTRACTBackgroundThe co-occurrence of PD-L1 positivity and EGFR mutations in advanced NSCLC often limits EGFR-TKIs effectiveness, with unclear mechanisms.MethodsWe analyzed 103 treatment-naive EGFR-mutant LUAD patients from three centers, assessing PD-L1 expression and performing NGS analysis.ResultsSMO mutations and MET amplification were significantly higher in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% group versus PD-L1 < 1% group (SMO: 8% vs. 0%, p = 0.048; MET: 18% vs. 7%, p = 0.023). The DNA Damage Response and Repair (DDR) pathogenic deficiency mutations, along with biological processes and signaling pathways related to DNA recombination, cell cycle transition and abnormal phosphorylation, were more prevalent in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% group. PIK3CA and RARA clonal alterations were more common in PD-L1 < 1% group, while TP53 clonal mutations predominated in PD-L1 ≥ 1% group. Retrospective analysis showed EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy extended median PFS by 9.8 months, potentially overcoming EGFR-TKI monotherapy resistance.ConclusionThis study elucidates the genomic characteristics of PD-L1-induced resistance to EGFR-TKIs. For patients with concurrent mutations in EGFR and PD-L1 expression, a first-line treatment strategy combining EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy may offer a more effective alternative.",0
"Objective:This study aimed to assess reporting quality of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the head and neck oncology literature using the TRIPOD-AI criteria.Data Sources:A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, incorporating search terms related to “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “deep learning,” “neural network,” and various head and neck neoplasms.Review Methods:Two independent reviewers analyzed each published study for adherence to the 65-point TRIPOD-AI criteria. Items were classified as “Yes,” “No,” or “NA” for each publication. The proportion of studies satisfying each TRIPOD-AI criterion was calculated. Additionally, the evidence level for each study was evaluated independently by two reviewers using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence. Discrepancies were reconciled through discussion until consensus was reached.Results:The study highlights the need for improvements in ML algorithm reporting in head and neck oncology. This includes more comprehensive descriptions of datasets, standardization of model performance reporting, and increased sharing of ML models, data, and code with the research community. Adoption of TRIPOD-AI is necessary for achieving standardized ML research reporting in head and neck oncology.Conclusion:Current reporting of ML algorithms hinders clinical application, reproducibility, and understanding of the data used for model training. To overcome these limitations and improve patient and clinician trust, ML developers should provide open access to models, code, and source data, fostering iterative progress through community critique, thus enhancing model accuracy and mitigating biases.","AbstractThe incidence of tumors increases significantly in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly among those undergoing dialysis. This dialysis-associated condition not only impacts therapy but also influences the prognosis of oncological patients, contributing to heightened mortality rates related to both cancer and non-cancer causes. Importantly, it stands as a primary factor leading to suboptimal utilization of therapies. Dosage adjustment for many types of chemotherapy is a necessity in patients with kidney impairment. However, due to a lack of comprehensive knowledge about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs in dialysis, adjustments are often made empirically, and in many cases, chemotherapy is avoided altogether. In this review, we highlight the current challenges and gaps in knowledge, and emphasize the imperative need for dedicated research to establish evidence-based guidelines for chemotherapy management in this vulnerable patient population.Graphical abstract",0
"PurposeWe aimed to study the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) using bioinformatics.MethodsGSE39582 and GSE39084, which collectively contain 363 CRC samples, were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database as a test set. TCGA-COADREAD, with 376 CRC samples, was downloaded from the UCSC database as a validation set. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for ARGs that were significantly associated with prognosis. The top 10 ARGs were used to classify the samples into different subtypes based on unsupervised cluster analysis. The immune environments of the different subtypes were analyzed. ARGs that were significantly associated with CRC prognosis were used to construct a risk model. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen independent prognostic factors and construct a nomogram.ResultsFour anoikis-related subtypes (ARSs) with differential prognoses and immune microenvironments were identified. KRAS and epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathways were enriched in subtype B, which had the worst prognosis. Three ARGs (DLG1, AKT3, and LPAR1) were used to construct the risk model. Both the test and validation sets showed worse outcomes for patients in the high-risk group than those in the low-risk group. Risk score was found to be an independent prognostic factor for CRC. Moreover, there was a difference in drug sensitivity between the high- and low-risk groups.ConclusionThe identified ARGs and risk scores were associated with CRC prognosis and could predict the responses of patients with CRC to immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04945-2.","IntroductionMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, treatment-resistant tumor. Anoikis is a particular type of programmed apoptosis brought on by the separation of cell–cell or extracellular matrix (ECM). Anoikis has been recognized as a crucial element in the development of tumors. However, few studies have comprehensively examined the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in malignant mesothelioma.MethodsARGs were gathered from the GeneCard database and the Harmonizome portals. We obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the GEO database. Univariate Cox regression analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were utilized to select ARGs associated with the prognosis of MPM. We then developed a risk model, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves were employed to confirm the ability of the model. The patients were divided into various subgroups using consensus clustering analysis. Based on the median risk score, patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups. Functional analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were conducted to estimate molecular mechanisms and the immune infiltration landscape of patients. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis and tumor microenvironment landscape were further explored.ResultsA novel risk model was constructed based on the six ARGs. The patients were successfully divided into two subgroups by consensus clustering analysis, with a striking difference in the prognosis and landscape of immune infiltration. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that the OS rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than the high-risk group. Functional analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis showed that high- and low-risk groups had different immune statuses and drug sensitivity.ConclusionsIn summary, we developed a novel risk model to predict MPM prognosis based on six selected ARGs, which could broaden comprehension of personalized and precise therapy approaches for MPM.",1
"PurposeProgrammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) are immunosuppressive proteins known to be associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. However, their expression and clinical relevance in osteosarcoma remain unknown. In this study, the relationships of PD-L1 and IDO1 expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis were explored.MethodsThe expression of PD-L1, IDO1, CD3, CD4, and CD8 in 112 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues collected by biopsy or surgical resection from 56 osteosarcoma patients was evaluated immunohistochemically. Moreover, four osteosarcoma cell lines were evaluated for the effects of IFNγ on PD-L1 and IDO1 mRNA expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.ResultsIn pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) primary specimens, 10 cases (17%) showed PD-L1 expression and 12 (21%) showed IDO1 expression. Six of ten cases (60%) with PD-L1 positivity co-expressed IDO1. In post-NAC metastatic lesions, the frequency of immunoexpression of PD-L1 and IDO1 was increased compared with that in pre-NAC specimens. PD-L1 and/or IDO1 expression was not associated with poor prognosis. PD-L1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells; while, IDO1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T cells. In all osteosarcoma cell lines, PD-L1 and IDO1 expression was upregulated by stimulation with IFNγ.ConclusionOur results suggest that the PD-L1 and IDO1 immune checkpoint inhibitors may provide clinical benefit in osteosarcoma patients with metastatic lesions after conventional chemotherapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03242-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeAtezolizumab has been shown to be effective and safe in randomized trial in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, there are limited real-life data on atezolizumab. In this study, we aimed to determine the real-life efficacy and safety of atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.MethodsThis trial is a retrospective multicenter study of the Turkish Oncology Group, which included extensive-stage SCLC patients who received atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy in a first-line treatment. The characteristics of the patients, treatment and response rates, and PFS and OS are presented. Factors associated with PFS and OS were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis.ResultsA total of 213 patients at the 30 oncology centers were included. The median number of chemotherapy cycle was 5 (1–8) and atezolizumab cycle was 7 (1–32). After median 11.9 months of follow-up, median PFS and OS was 6.8 months (95%CI 5.7–7.8), and 11.9 months (95%CI 11–12.7), respectively. The ORR was 61.9%. ECOG-PS (p = 0.002) and number of metastatic sites (p = 0.001) were associated with PFS and pack-year of smoking (p = 0.05), while ECOG-PS (p = 0.03) and number of metastatic sites (p = 0.001) were associated with OS. Hematological side effects were common and toxicities were manageable.ConclusionThis real-life data confirm the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.",1
"ABSTRACTMetastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can present with oligometastatic disease and/or develop oligoprogression following systemic therapy. Cytoreductive and focal metastasis-directed therapy options include resection, stereotactic ablative radiation and thermal ablation. Aggressive focal therapy may allow delay in initiation of or modification to systemic therapy and improve clinical outcomes. In this narrative review we synthesize current practice guidelines and prospective data on focal therapy management options and highlight future research. Patient selection and the choice of focal treatment techniques are controversial due to limited and heterogeneous data and patients may benefit from multidisciplinary evaluation. Prospective comparative trials with clearly defined inclusion criteria and relevant end points are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of different approaches.","ABSTRACTPatients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have very poor long-term outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can potentially cure some of these patients who are able to achieve a second or greater remission with salvage chemotherapy. Unfortunately, several barriers exist to transplantation and not all patients with r/r AML are able to proceed to allo-SCT. Therefore, novel therapies to decrease the risk of relapse in these patients are urgently needed. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein has emerged as an encouraging vaccine target in AML due to its overexpression in leukemic blast cells and near absence in normal hematopoietic cells. Maintenance therapy with galinpepimut-S, a multivalent heteroclitic WT1 peptide vaccine, holds promise in early phase trials, in patients with AML by inducing a strong innate immune response against the WT1 antigen, leading to the design of this international, open-label, randomized clinical trial, named REGAL. Clinical trial registration:  The clinical trial identifier is NCT04229979.",0
"Evolving evidence indicates that tumor cells can transdifferentiate between distinct transcriptionally-determined cell states with changes in resultant phenotypes, a phenomenon known as cellular plasticity. These transitions are not driven by genetic mutations and typically in contrast to normal developmental processes, may proceed bidirectionally. Here, we review the role of cellular plasticity in the aggressive childhood solid tumor, neuroblastoma. We discuss the detection of two cell states, termed mesenchymal (MES) and adrenergic (ADRN), their properties and the transcriptional circuitries that control them, their relation to the normal embryogenesis of the sympathetic nervous system and their potential role in drug resistance, escape from therapy and development of relapse.","The mammalian gut microbiota plays diverse and essential roles in modulating host physiology. Key mediators determining the outcome of the microbiota-host interactions are the small molecule metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. The liver is a major organ exposed to gut microbial metabolites, and it serves as the nexus for maintaining healthy interactions between the gut microbiota and the host. At the same time, the liver is the primary target of potentially harmful gut microbial metabolites. In this review, we provide an up-to-date list of gut microbial metabolites that have been identified to either increase or decrease host susceptibility to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. The signaling pathways and molecular factors involved in the progression of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity are well-established, and we propose that the mouse model of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity serves as a model system for uncovering gut microbial metabolites with previously unknown functions. Furthermore, we envision that gut microbial metabolites identified to alter APAP-induced hepatotoxicity likely have broader implications in other liver diseases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis review provides an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in modulating the host susceptibility to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. It focuses on the roles of gut bacterial small molecule metabolites as mediators of the interaction between the gut microbiota and the liver. It also illustrates the utility of APAP-induced liver injury as a model to identify gut microbial metabolites with biological function.",0
"P2 purinergic receptor expression is dysregulated in multiple cancer subtypes and is associated with worse outcomes. Studies identify roles for P2 purinergic receptors in tumor cells that drive disease aggressiveness. There is also sufficient evidence that P2 purinergic receptor expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for disease initiation and progression. Immune cells constitute a significant component of the TME and display both tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic potential. Studies pre-dating the investigation of P2 purinergic receptors in cancer identify P2 receptor expression on multiple immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, T-cells, and dendritic cells; all of which are implicated in tumor initiation, tumor promotion, or response to treatment. Herein, we discuss P2 purinergic receptor expression and function in tumor-related immune cells. We provide a rationale for further investigations of P2 purinergic receptors within the TME to better define the mechanistic pathways of inflammation-mediate tumorigenesis and explore P2 purinergic receptors as potential targets for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.","AbstractThe respiratory tract with its vast surface area and very thin air-blood tissue barrier presents an extremely large interface for potential interaction with xenobiotics such as inhaled pathogens or medicaments. To protect its large and vulnerable surface, the lung is populated with several different types of immune cells. Pulmonary epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells are key players in shaping the innate and adaptive immune response. Due to their localization, they represent a frontline of cell populations that are among the first to come in contact with inhaled xenobiotics. Furthermore, depending on the lung compartment they populate, these cells show a large variety in morphology, phenotype, and function. These unique characteristics make those cell populations ideal targets for specific immunomodulators that are designed for inhalation. Depending on cell population or lung compartment targeting, a specific immune response may be triggered or modulated. The purpose of a potent carrier for pulmonary immunomodulation is, first, to efficiently target a specific immunocompetent cell and, second, to affect its role in generating an immune response. Immunomodulation may occur at different levels of immune cell-antigen interaction, that is antigen uptake, trafficking, processing and presentation. Inhalation of nanosized carriers for drugs or vaccines shows great potential for both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches in order to modulate immune responses locally or systemically, due to the specific deposition and targeting properties of nanoparticles. Immune responses triggered by nanosized particles may be either immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive and depending on the specific purpose, stimulation or suppression may either be desired or unwanted. Meticulous analysis of immunomodulatory potential, pharmacologic and toxicologic testing of inhalable nanocarriers is required in order to find novel and optimal approaches for prophylaxis and therapy of pulmonary diseases. The design and characterization of such nanoparticles requires well-coordinated interdisciplinary research among engineers, biologists and clinicians.",0
"AbstractNecroptosis, a cell death mechanism with the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. Induction of necroptosis for cancer therapy may be possible through the regulation of the expression of a key factor gene receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3 (RIPK3) via in vitro transcription (IVT) mRNA delivery. However, mRNA is susceptible to degradation and has a low delivery efficiency, which highlights the requirement of a proper delivery vehicle for intracellular delivery. Therefore, a new mRNA delivery system based on the nanostructured silica nanoparticles, termed mRNA‐protective nanocage (mPN) has been developed. High‐efficiency expression of RIPK3 and induction of necroptosis is achieved through delivery of RIPK3 IVT mRNA with mPN in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, the mPN carrying RIPK3 mRNA distributed locally in tumors upon intravascular injection, and successfully induced necroptosis and immune cell infiltration, a hallmark of necroptosis. the suppression of tumor growth in a murine cancer model, demonstrating the synergistic effect of RIPK3 mRNA‐ and immune cell‐mediated therapy is also observed. These findings suggest the potential for anticancer therapy through necroptosis induction and provide a strategy for the development of mRNA‐based nanomedicine.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematologic malignancy. Chemotherapy resistance results in a dismal survival rate of 1–2 years in older adults with AML. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently required. In this context, microRNA (miRNA)-based treatments remain an untapped strategy in AML. Using patient-derived specimens, we found increased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of older adults with AML, and decreased miR-497-5p in CD34+ leukemic blasts. Target prediction revealed that miR-497-5p could directly target mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAP2K1) mRNA to indirectly target cytokines and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway through the p38-MAPK signaling pathway, potentially inhibiting leukemic growth and overcoming chemoresistance from venetoclax. To improve miRNA delivery and minimize off-target effects, which represent key barriers to clinical translation, we developed liposomes for co-delivery of miR-497-5p and venetoclax. We decorated our liposomes with a peptide targeting CLL1, which is present on 92% of leukemia blasts while being absent in normal hematopoietic cells. This targeted approach demonstrated high efficacy in inhibiting AML growth in mice with minimal toxicity, as well as reduced exposure to chemoresistance. Our findings suggested that anti-CLL1-decorated, miR-497-5p, and venetoclax-loaded liposomes represent a promising novel miRNA-based therapeutic, which should be investigated further as a strategy to reduce venetoclax resistance in AML.",0
"PurposeTo compare the toxicity and clinical efficacy of TL (docetaxel + lobaplatin) induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy and TPF (docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Methods and patientsIn total, 128 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled between August 2016 and April 2021. They were randomly divided into trial group and control group, all using chronological dosage mode. The trial group used TL regimen induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy; the control group used TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The endpoints were adverse events and survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years.ResultsMedian follow-up was 42 months (20–71 months).  Adverse events: During induction chemotherapy, compared with TPF group, grade 3–4 leukocytes and neutrophils, diarrhea, 1–2 hyperbilirubinemia, nausea / vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, hyponatremia were significantly lower in TL group (p<0. 05): 6% vs. 35%, 14% vs. 53%, 0% vs. 6%, 15% vs. 40%, 9% vs. 56%, 0% vs. 10%, 3% vs. 13%, 2% vs. 23%, 15% vs. 74%. During chemoradiotherapy, the incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalaemia and grade 1–2 nausea was significantly lower in the TL group (p<0. 05), with 24% vs. 69%, 20% vs. 65% and 24% vs. 44%, respectively. However, more grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia were observed in the TL group (15% vs. 3%, p<0. 05).  There was no significant difference in the recent objective response rate (ORR) between patients with TL group and TPF group (p=0.961).  There was no statistical difference in 1, 3 and 5 years OS between TL group and TPF group, respectively, (71.0% vs. 67.5%, p=0.573), (56.6% vs. 56.9%, p=0.814), (52.5% vs. 52.9%, p=0.841); 1, 3 and 5 years PFS are: (63.4% vs. 64.0%, p=0.883), (51.1% vs. 54.0%, p=0.705) and (47.3% vs. 45.9%, p=0.887), None of them were significantly different. Multivariate analysis of COX regression showed that T stage (p=0.01) and surgery (p=0.046) were independent factors affecting PFS and OS, respectively. OS subgroup analysis shows that people receiving the TL regimen in postoperative and nodal stage N1 and N2 patients tended to survive longer than those receiving the TPF regimen.ConclusionPatients with postoperative, N1 or N2 stage locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may have more significant clinical benefits when treated with TL regimen. TL regimen has advantages in reducing toxic side effects and can be used as one of the first-line treatment options.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03117257).","PurposeWe aimed to assess the predictive value of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) therapy using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted at Seoul National University Hospital. Patients with EGFR/ALK-wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received ICBs between December 2013 and December 2019 were enrolled. Patients with archived blood samples collected prior to ICB treatment were assigned to the ELISA cohort. In addition, those with tissue samples from sites of recurrence or metastasis were assigned to an IHC cohort. Then, we analyzed Gal-3 expression in both cohorts.ResultsFifty-six patients in the ELISA cohort were grouped into low (N = 36) and high (N = 20) groups, using the mean Gal-3 ELISA level (13.24 pg/ml) as a cutoff. The high group demonstrated trends toward reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (0.9 vs. 3.7 months, p = 0.196) and significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (1.6 vs. 12.3 months, p = 0.018) than the low group. We categorized 94 patients in the IHC cohort into negative (N = 31) and positive (N = 63) groups based on Gal-3 IHC positivity. However, the median PFS (4.6 vs. 4.6 months for the negative vs. positive IHC group, respectively, p = 0.345) and OS (16.4 vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.137) were not significantly different.ConclusionHigh blood Gal-3 levels may predict inferior survival in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with ICBs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04275-9.",0
"Breast cancer represents the most frequently diagnosed form of cancer among women on a global scale. In recent years, there has been a notable increase in interest among researchers in exploring alternative therapeutic methods, including stem cell therapy. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned media (AD-MSCs-CM) on apoptosis induction and migration inhibition of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) in vitro. In this study, malignant breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) were cultured separately in DMEM/F12/FBS (15%) culture media under standard conditions. Subsequently, the conditioned media derived from AD-MSCs was introduced to the MDA-MB-231 cells. Following a 24- and 48-hour exposure period, the expression levels of CASP3, KRAS, and MMP9 were evaluated using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Furthermore, the proliferation and migration abilities of the cancer cells were evaluated using MTT and wound healing assays, respectively. Furthermore, the protein expression of Caspase-3, K-RAS, and MMP-9 was examined using a western blot assay. It is noteworthy that the expression levels of the MMP9 and KRAS genes were significantly reduced following treatment with AD-MSCs-CM in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the CASP3 gene expression level was found to have increased significantly in the treated groups. Additionally, the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with AD-MSCs-CM was markedly diminished by MTT and wound healing assays. Moreover, the AD-MSCs-CM was observed to induce caspase-3 activation and reduce the protein expression of K-RAS and MMP-9. The results of this study indicate that AD-MSCs-CM may exert an influence on the apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of breast cancer cells. Consequently, it could be proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for the suppression of breast cancer. However, further testing and research are required to validate these findings and to ascertain the full potential of this approach.","BackgroundAURKA, Aurora kinase A encoding gene, is an important signaling hub gene for mitosis. In recent years, AURKA has been implicated in the occurrence and development of several cancers. However, its relationship with the tumor microenvironment in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects are still unclear.MethodWe adopted a variety of bioinformatics methods to comprehensively analyze the potential carcinogenesis of AURKA in SKCM, and constructed a prognostic nomogram model. We also dentified an inhibitor targeting AURKA and verified its therapeutic effects against SKCM using the molecular docking technology.ResultsWe found that abnormally high expression of AURKA was responsible for driving the occurrence and development of SKCM, and affected various pathological factors in SKCM. In addition, AURKA was established as an independent marker of poor SKCM prognosis. We also characterized the potential mechanisms by which AURKA manifests its effects in SKCM and found that AURKA inhibits the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and promotes hypoxia by activating the TGF-β signaling pathway. At the same time, the high AURKA expression group had higher tumor stemness index and promoted cell proliferation and metastasis. Finally, the small-molecule compound ZNC97018978 targeting AURKA screened by molecular docking technology can inhibit the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of SKCM. The possible mechanism is that ZNC97018978 induces apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation.ConclusionAURKA is the core hub gene driving the occurrence and development of SKCM, and its expression is regulated by epigenetic modifications. AURKA can regulate the infiltration level of various immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and apoptosis, and hypoxia. Thus, it is a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in SKCM. ZNC97018978 is an effective and safe inhibitor of AURKA in vitro; its safety and effectiveness in vivo as a potential treatment for cutaneous melanoma should be further determined.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04164-1.",1
"This cross-sectional study examines the association between Medicaid expansion following the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and changes in insurance status, cancer stage at diagnosis, and timely treatment among patients with incident breast, colon, and non–small cell lung cancer.","BACKGROUND:Endemic and pandemic infectious diseases take a substantial toll on human health. Advancing understanding about the determinants of protective immunity could provide avenues toward improved treatments for infections. In 1983, a small protein and presumptive antiviral “interferon,” IFN-γ, was characterized as a factor released by antigen-stimulated lymphocytes that equips macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Shortly thereafter, IFN-γ became the first cytokine used for host-directed therapy of a nonviral infectious disease in humans. The ensuing decades of research developed knowledge about the induction of IFN-γ and its downstream target genes; provided an understanding about individuals with IFN-γ–related genetic defects that render them susceptible to infections; and documented the therapeutic impact of endogenously produced and exogenously administered IFN-γ on infectious disease.ADVANCES:It is now known that IFN-γ is produced by various lymphocytes. IFN-γ released by these lymphoid populations can act on cells expressing IFN-γ receptor plus the kinases (Janus kinases 1 and 2) and transcription factor (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) needed for signaling in response to IFN-γ. Although IFN-γ was initially considered to regulate macrophages, hundreds of human cell types express the signaling machinery and may have the ability to respond to IFN-γ.The hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) elicited by IFN-γ encode a variety of proteins, including enzymes, ion channels, and pumps. These molecules promote oxidation, nitrosylation, and acidification of intracellular microbes residing in vacuoles; restrict the availability of host metabolites and metals on which pathogens depend; disrupt microbial membranes; impair microbial uptake into or exit from host cells; or promote eviction of microbial pathogens. Given the cytotoxic effects of some ISGs, numerous suppressors and antagonists regulate the action of IFN-γ. These include type I IFNs, which can reduce production of IFN-γ; transforming growth factor–β and interleukin-10, which block IFN-γ’s ability to activate macrophages; and regulatory T cells induced in part by IFN-γ itself.Although both knockout mice and people with inborn errors of IFN-γ immunity are susceptible to diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections, the nonredundant role of IFN-γ in human host defense is narrower than in artificially infected mice. Growing knowledge of “Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease” (MSMD) reveals it to be neither strictly Mendelian nor restricted to mycobacterial disease, to arise from genotypes in at least 21 loci that impair production of and/or responses to IFN-γ, and to be phenocopied by auto-antibodies that neutralize IFN-γ. Besides reinforcing the importance of IFN-γ for macrophage antimicrobial defense, MSMD studies have uncovered multiple new facets of human immunobiology, for example, that interferon-stimulated gene 15 secreted by granulocytes promotes IFN-γ secretion by natural killer cells, giving the host a way to activate macrophages without recourse to adaptive immunity. Lastly, beneficial clinical experience with administration of recombinant IFN-γ has been reported in >1100 patients for prophylaxis or treatment of diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections.OUTLOOK:We now have a wider view of what it means to be an “interferon,” the cells beyond macrophages that IFN-γ equips, and the opportunities to prevent or treat infections that IFN-γ offers. Patients deficient for IFN-γ production but who can respond to it are candidates for adjunctive IFN-γ treatment or prophylaxis. Such individuals include those with MSMD as well as those with other immunodeficiencies, for example, people with HIV/AIDS, certain cancers, advanced age, or a disease-selective defect in producing IFN-γ during infection.Clinical use of IFN-γ will benefit from a deeper knowledge of IFN-γ biology. For example, future work could help answer the following questions: How are new IFN-γ–dependent genes born and regulated? How widely do transposable elements and endogenous retroviruses serve as functional components in the promoters of IFN-γ–dependent ISGs? What are the roles and structures of many IFN-γ–induced ISGs whose biology remains mysterious? What are the contributions of ISGs that are negatively affected by IFN-γ? How do regulatory loops among different IFN responses affect the course of infections? Hopefully, we can use the answers to such questions to design novel approaches to kill or restrict microbes that cause serious disease or death in the human population. We may also help treat some infectious diseases with an exogenous source of antimicrobial molecules whose production IFN-γ normally induces in the host.",0
"Imaging is a key technology in the early detection of cancers, including X-ray mammography, low dose CT for lung cancer, or optical imaging for skin, esophageal, or colorectal cancers. Historically, imaging information in early detection schema was assessed qualitatively. However, the last decade has seen increased development of computerized tools that convert images into quantitative mineable data (radiomics), and their subsequent analyses with artificial intelligence, AI. These tools are improving diagnostic accuracy of early lesions to define risk and classify malignant/aggressive from benign/indolent disease. The first section of this review will briefly describe the various imaging modalities and their use as primary or secondary screens in an early detection pipeline. The second section will describe specific use cases to illustrate the breadth of imaging modalities as well as the benefits of quantitative image analytics. These will include optical (skin cancer), X-ray CT (pancreatic and lung cancer), X-ray mammography (breast cancer), multiparametric MRI (breast and prostate cancer), PET (pancreatic cancer), and ultrasound elastography (liver cancer). Finally, we will discuss the inexorable improvements in radiomics to build more robust classifier models, and the significant limitations to this development that include access will well annotated data bases, and biological descriptors of the imaged feature data.","PurposeTo develop a radiomics nomogram based on dual-phase enhanced computed tomography (CT) for predicting the Ki-67 index status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods137 patients with NSCLC who had undergone dual-phase enhanced CT scans and Ki-67 examination within 2 weeks were retrospectively enrolled between January 2020 and December 2022. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and the patients were categorized based on low or high expression of Ki-67 index, with a cut-off value of 40%. The cohort was randomly divided into a training group (n = 95) and a testing group (n = 42) at a ratio of 7:3. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was employed to select the most valuable radiomics features from the dual-phase enhanced CT images. Subsequently, a nomogram that incorporated the radiomics score and clinical factors associated with Ki-67 index status was established through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The predictive performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsThe AUC values of the radiomics features of artery phase and vein phase CT in the testing group were 0.748 and 0.758, respectively. The AUC of the dual-phase enhanced CT was 0.785, and the AUC of the developed nomogram was 0.859, which was higher than those of the radiomics (AUC, 0.785) and clinical models (AUC, 0.736).ConclusionsThe radiomics nomogram based on dual-phase enhanced CT images provides a promising method for predicting the Ki-67 index status in patients with advanced NSCLC.",1
"Immunotherapy has revolutionized the systemic treatment of solid tumors, including advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC), providing durable responses with a favorable safety profile. Multiple immune checkpoint inhibitor agents have been approved in monotherapy in second-line setting, and for a selected group of chemo-naïve cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression. Despite the incorporation of immunotherapy to the systemic treatment landscape of aUC, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in frontline setting for vast majority of patients. Urothelial carcinoma is a chemosensitive disease with response rates of up to 50% to frontline chemotherapy. However, the response to chemotherapy is short lasting with vast majority of patients experiencing disease progression and death within months. In this context, maintenance therapy constitutes an attractive therapeutic strategy to maximize the time to treatment failure. Different cytotoxic and targeted agents have been investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC but have not shown an impact on survival. Avelumab has become the first and only drug to improve overall survival as maintenance therapy after frontline platinum-based therapy in aUC patients and the first drug to be approved in this setting. This article will review the rational for maintenance therapy, the different drugs investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC, and the impact of avelumab maintenance therapy as a new standard of care in the management of aUC.","Objective.Arthritis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies highlights the importance of immune checkpoint expression for joint homeostasis. We investigated the role of programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 in the synovium using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model.Methods.We blocked PD-L1 using blocking antibodies during CIA and assessed the arthritis severity by clinical and histologic scoring. PD-L1 expression and the origin of synovial macrophages were investigated using flow cytometry and parabiosis. We used Cre-Lox mice to ascertain the protective role of PD-L1–expressing macrophages in arthritis. The immune profile of human and murine synovial PD-L1+ macrophages was determined by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing.Results.Anti–PD-L1 antibody treatment during CIA worsened arthritis with increased immune cell infiltration compared with isotype control, supporting the regulatory role of PD-L1 in the joint. The main cells expressing PD-L1 in the synovium were macrophages. Using parabiosis, we showed that synovial PD-L1+ macrophages were both locally proliferating and partially replaced by the circulation. PD-L1+ macrophages had increased levels of MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) and interleukin (IL)-10 expression during acute CIA. Genetic depletion of PD-L1 on macrophages in LyzcrePD-L1fl/fl mice resulted in worsened CIA compared with controls. We found that human PD-L1+ macrophages in the synovium of healthy individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis express MerTK and IL-10.Conclusion.PD-L1+ macrophages with efferocytotic and anti-inflammatory characteristics protect the synovium from severe arthritis in the CIA mouse model. Tissue-protective, PD-L1–expressing macrophages are also present in the human synovium at homeostasis and during rheumatoid arthritis.",0
"AbstractBackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review synthesises all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making. It updates the previous version of the review, published in 2018.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both on overall survival, severe or life‐threatening adverse events, and quality of life in people undergoing first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.Search methodsWe searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CANCERLIT, and handsearched various sources for additional studies. The latest search dates were in March and July 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both with another intervention or best supportive care. Participants were required to have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer not amenable to curative intent treatment. Histological confirmation was required. Trials were required to report overall survival.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.Main resultsWe included 75 studies in the review and 51 in the meta‐analysis (11,333 participants). We divided the studies into seven categories: any anti‐cancer treatment versus best supportive care; various chemotherapy types versus gemcitabine; gemcitabine‐based combinations versus gemcitabine alone; various chemotherapy combinations versus gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel; fluoropyrimidine‐based studies; miscellaneous studies; and radiotherapy studies. In general, the included studies were at low risk for random sequence generation, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias, at unclear risk for allocation concealment, and high risk for performance bias.Compared to best supportive care, chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.33; absolute risk of death at 12 months of 971 per 1000 versus 962 per 1000; 4 studies, 298 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The adverse effects of chemotherapy and impacts on quality of life (QoL) were uncertain. Many of the chemotherapy regimens were outdated.Eight studies compared non‐gemcitabine‐based chemotherapy regimens to gemcitabine. These showed that 5‐fluorouracil (5FU) likely reduces OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27; risk of death at 12 months of 914 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 1 study, 126 participants; moderate certainty), and grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). Fixed dose rate gemcitabine likely improves OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; risk of death at 12 months of 683 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 644 participants; moderate certainty), and likely increase grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). FOLFIRINOX improves OS (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60; risk of death at 12 months of 524 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 652 participants; high certainty), and delays deterioration in QoL, but increases grade 3/4 adverse events.Twenty‐eight studies compared gemcitabine‐based combinations to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine plus platinum may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; risk of death at 12 months of 745 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 6 studies, 1140 participants; low certainty), may increase grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely worsens QoL. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improves OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; risk of death at 12 months of 722 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 10 studies, 2718 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely improves QoL. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitors result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; risk of death at 12 months of 770 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 3 studies, 839 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely does not alter QoL. Gemcitabine plus taxane result in a large improvement in OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; risk of death at 12 months of 644 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 986 participants; high certainty), and likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events and improves QoL.Nine studies compared chemotherapy combinations to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combination regimens improve OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; risk of death at 12 months of 542 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 6 studies, 1285 participants; high certainty). The treatment arms had distinct toxicity profiles, and there was little to no difference in QoL. Alternative schedules of gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel likely result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.47; risk of death at 12 months of 663 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 2 studies, 367 participants; moderate certainty) or QoL, but may increase grade 3/4 adverse events.Four studies compared fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations to fluoropyrimidines alone, with poor quality evidence. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations are likely to result in little to no impact on OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.15; risk of death at 12 months of 765 per 1000 versus 704 per 1000; P = 0.27; 4 studies, 491 participants; moderate certainty) versus fluoropyrimidines alone. The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in grade 3/4 adverse events or QoL between the two groups.We included only one radiotherapy (iodine‐125 brachytherapy) study with 165 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of radiotherapy on outcomes.Authors' conclusionsCombination chemotherapy remains standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus a taxane improve OS compared to gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that fluoropyrimidine‐based combination chemotherapy regimens improve OS compared to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. The effects of radiotherapy were uncertain as only one low‐quality trial was included. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individuals still remains unpersonalised, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to assist in rationalising treatment selection for patients.","AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.",1
"PurposeProstate cancer can undergo curative effects by radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy. However, the best treatment for more aggressive high-risk prostate cancer remains controversial. Insufficient infiltration capacity and dysfunction are commonly occurrences in engineered T lymphocytes expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T), characterizing cancer immunotherapy failure. We conducted this study to investigate whether the combinative application of docetaxel and PSMA-CAR-T cells could be a more effective treatment to prostate cancer.MethodsExpressions of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate cancer cells were examined by Flow cytometry. The efficaciousness of PSMA-CAR-T was evaluated in vitro using ELISA and RTCA. The effect of intermixed therapy was assessed in vivo utilizing a human prostate cancer liver metastasis mouse model and a human prostate cancer cell xenograft mouse model.ResultsThe outcome of cytokine discharge and cell killing assays demonstrated that PSMA-CAR-T cells have characteristic effector capacity against PSMA+ prostate cancer cells in vitro. Additionally, collaborative treatment of PSMA-CAR-T cells and docetaxel have cooperative efficacy in a mouse model of human prostate cancer. The merged strategy could be seen as an undeveloped avenue to augmenting adoptive CAR-T cell immunotherapy and mitigating the adverse side effects of chemotherapy.ConclusionsCooperation of PSMA-specific CAR-T cells and the chemotherapy drug docetaxel can impressively ameliorate antitumor effectiveness against an installed metastatic human prostate cancer model in NPG mice.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04248-y.","Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is a rare, biologically aggressive variant of endometrial cancer with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. HER2 overexpression (3+ positivity) by IHC and/or FISH ERBB2 gene amplification is detected in approximately one-third of patients with USC. Clinical trials incorporating trastuzumab with standard chemotherapy have recently demonstrated improved progression-free and overall survival in advanced-stage or recurrent USC that overexpresses HER2. However, a large number of patients with USC eventually developed resistance to trastuzumab. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a novel HER2-directed antibody–drug conjugate with a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for multiple tumor indications. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of T-DXd in primary USC cell lines and xenografts with different HER2 expression. T-DXd-induced cell growth suppression in HER2-overexpressing cell lines in vitro, increased early and late apoptosis as assessed by annexin and propidium iodide staining, and, similarly to trastuzumab, T-DXd-induced significant antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in the presence of peripheral blood lymphocytes. While negligible activity was detected against USC cell lines with low HER2 expression, T-DXd demonstrated significant bystander killing against USC tumors with low/negligible HER2 when such cells were admixed with HER2 3+ tumor cells in vitro. T-DXd showed tumor growth suppression in in vivo USC PDX models that overexpress HER2 at 3+ levels, prolonging survival when compared with controls, with minimal toxicity. Future clinical trials are warranted in patients with USC failing trastuzumab treatment.",0
"BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundAlthough targeted therapies and immunotherapy have achieved significant clinical benefits in patients with certain pathological types of lung cancer. However, prognosis for patients with lung adenocarcinoma still remains unsatisfactory. It is of extremely importance to find ideal prognostic indicators to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients, especially for patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the significance of Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1) and Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.MethodsIn this study, IGFR1 and VEGF-A expression on 119 specimens of patients early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed by immunohistochemistry with an H-score system.ResultsBoth high IGFR1 expression and VEGF-A expression patients were resulted in 59 (49.6%) separately. The numbers and proportions of IGFR1−&VEGF-A− subgroup, IGFR1−&VEGF-A+ subgroup, IGFR1+&VEGF-A− subgroup and IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ subgroup are 23 (19.3%), 37 (31.1%), 37 (31.1%) and 22 (18.5%) respectively. High IGFR1 expression was significantly associated with both poor PFS and OS of all patients in a univariate analysis. Multivariable analysis showed that patients with IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ expression exhibited a worst PFS and OS in the subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutation.ConclusionsThese results suggest that IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ is expected to be a disadvantageous factor for prognosis in the subgroup of EGFR mutation in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. What’s more, this study may provide the theoretical possibility to screen optimal population for a combination therapy with anti-VEGF and anti-IGFR1 in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05371-0.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer, with high incidence and mortality worldwide. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advancements, HCC remains poorly responsive to treatment, with a poor prognosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving HCC is crucial for developing effective therapies. Emerging evidence indicates that dysregulated fatty acid metabolism contributes to HCC. Acyl-CoA medium-chain synthetase 5 (ACSM5), involved in fatty acid metabolism, is down-regulated in HCC; however, its role is not well understood. This study was used to analyze ACSM5 expression in HCC patient samples and cell lines. The newly established ACSM5-overexpressing HCC cell lines, Huh7-ACSM5 and Hepa1-6–ACSM5, were used to investigate the effects and regulatory mechanisms of ACSM5. The results showed that ACSM5 was significantly down-regulated in HCC tumor tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. ACSM5 expression was regulated by DNA methylation, with a DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor effectively increasing ACSM5 expression and reducing promoter region methylation. Overexpression of ACSM5 in Huh7 cells reduced fatty acid accumulation, decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenografts. Furthermore, ACSM5 overexpression also decreased STAT3 phosphorylation, subsequently affecting downstream cytokine TGFB and FGF12 mRNA levels. These findings suggest that ACSM5 down-regulation contributes to HCC progression, providing insights into its oncogenic role and highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical health concern in Korea, ranking as the second leading cause of cancer mortality and imposing substantial economic burdens, particularly among the working-age population. This review examines recent advancements in treating advanced HCC, referencing the updated 2022 HCC guidelines and the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer system. Historically, first-line systemic therapies included sorafenib and lenvatinib, with regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab serving as second-line options. Since 2020, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown superior overall survival than sorafenib, leading to the adoption of combination therapies such as atezolizumab with bevacizumab and durvalumab with tremelimumab as first-line treatments. The IMbrave150 study demonstrated that atezolizumab–bevacizumab significantly extended median overall survival and progression-free survival, with the longest survival reported in any phase 3 trial for advanced HCC. Similarly, the HIMALAYA study indicated that durvalumab combined with tremelimumab significantly improved survival rates. Second-line therapies now include regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, nivolumab with ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab, each offering benefits for specific patient populations. Nonetheless, these therapies are associated with side effects that require careful management. Traditional targeted therapies can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular events, and hand-foot skin reactions, whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors may cause immune-related adverse events affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system. Clinicians must be well-versed in these treatments and their potential side effects to provide optimal patient care. The emergence of combination therapies targeting complex biological pathways signifies a new paradigm in HCC treatment, emphasizing the importance of continuous education and vigilant monitoring to optimize patient outcomes.",0
"AbstractCentral to immune recognition is the glycocalyx, a glycan-rich coat on all cells that plays a crucial role in interactions that enable pathogen detection and activation of immune defenses. Pathogens and cancerous cells often display distinct glycans on their surfaces, making these saccharide antigens prime targets for vaccine development. However, carbohydrates alone generally serve as poor immunogens due to their often weak binding affinities, inability to effectively recruit T cell help, and reliance on adjuvants to iboost immune activation. The introduction of glycoconjugate vaccines, initially involving the covalent coupling of carbohydrate antigens to carrier proteins, marked a pivotal advancement by facilitating neutralizing antibody production against carbohydrate targets. Despite successes in generating glycoconjugate vaccines against certain bacterial diseases, challenges persist in creating effective vaccines against numerous intracellular pathogens and non-communicable diseases such as cancer. In this review, we highlight new developments in conjugate vaccine platforms aim to overcome these limitations by optimizing the display of glycan and T cell epitopes as well as incorporating defined carbohydrate adjuvants to direct tailored immune responses. These advancements promise to improve the effectiveness of carbohydrate-based vaccines and broaden their coverage against a wide range of diseases.","The immune system is highly regulated but, when dysregulated, suboptimal protective or overly robust immune responses can lead to immune-mediated disorders. The genetic and molecular mechanisms of immune regulation are incompletely understood, impeding the development of more precise diagnostics and therapeutics for immune-mediated disorders. Recently, thousands of previously unrecognized noncanonical microprotein genes encoded by small open reading frames have been identified. Many of these microproteins perform critical functions, often in a cell- and context-specific manner. Several microproteins are now known to regulate immunity; however, the vast majority are uncharacterized. Therefore, illuminating what is often referred to as the “dark proteome,” may present opportunities to tune immune responses more precisely. Here, we review noncanonical microprotein biology, highlight recently discovered examples regulating immunity, and discuss the potential and challenges of modulating dysregulated immune responses by targeting microproteins.",1
"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Since immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have had significant benefits in SCLC, studying and overcoming the mechanisms of ICI resistance have become critical. Oncolytic virotherapy has been demonstrated to improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy by favorably changing the tumor microenvironment. This suggests the potential of oncolytic virotherapy to overcome ICI resistance in SCLC. Herein, we report a patient with extensive-stage SCLC who underwent previous chemotherapy and ICI therapy since its recurrence. Because the disease progressed despite immunotherapy, we employed exploratory oncolytic therapy, which was able to successfully overcome ICI resistance with a considerable progression-free survival benefit of 9 months. This suggests that oncolytic virotherapy can considerably improve the antitumor efficacy of ICI therapy. We also observed changes in the infiltration of CD8 + T cells; the localization of CD8 + T cells tended change from “excluded” to “inflamed,” and its abundance increased as treatment continued. This confirms favorable changes in the immune microenvironment. Our study proposed the potential benefit of adopting oncolytic virotherapy to overcome ICI resistance in patients with SCLC. We also revealed its impact on the immune microenvironment to guide future mechanistic investigations.","Aim: To develop a trivalent DNA vaccine candidate encapsulated in Chitosan-TPP nanoparticles against hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and assess its immunogenicity in mice.Materials & methods: Trivalent plasmid carrying the VP1 and VP2 genes of EV-A71, VP1 gene of CV-A16 was encapsulated in Chitosan-TPP nanoparticles through ionic gelation. In vitro characterization and in vivo immunization studies of the CS-TPP-NPs (pIRES-VP121) were performed.Results: Mice administered with CS-TPP NPs (pIRES-VP121) intramuscularly were observed to have the highest IFN-γ response.

"Chondrosarcomas, a rare form of bone sarcomas with multiple subtypes, pose a pressing clinical challenge for patients with advanced or metastatic disease. The lack of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications underscores the urgent need for further research and development in this area. Patients and their families face challenges as there are no systemic therapeutic options available with substantial effectiveness. A significant number (50–80%) of chondrosarcomas have a mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes. This review focuses on IDH-mediated pathogenesis and recent pharmacological advances with novel IDH inhibitors, explores their potential therapeutic value, and proposes potential future avenues for clinical trials combining IDH inhibitors with other systemic agents for chondrosarcomas.","AimThe aim of this study was to construct and validate a nomogram to predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) in external ear melanoma (EEM) patients in the elderly based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.MethodsThe information of patients diagnosed with EEM in the elderly between 2010 and 2014 was downloaded from the SEER database. Univariable and multivariable Cox analyses were carried out to identify the independent characteristics, and the independent factors were further included to construct a nomogram. The discriminative ability and calibration of the nomogram to predict OS were tested using C-index value, and calibration plots. Based on the risk score of the nomogram, the patients were divided into high- and low-risk subgroup. Finally, the survival differences of different subgroups were explored by Kaplan–Meier curves. All statistical analyses were performed by R 4.2.0.ResultsA total of 710 elderly EMM patients were included and randomly divided into training cohort and validation cohort. Univariable Cox regression were used to identify age, race, sex, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), T, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tumor size as independent risk factors. Then, multivariable Cox model to determine significant risk factors was used to establish the selected factors. A nomogram for predicting the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was constructed using the independent variables including age, AJCC, T, surgery and chemotherapy. The C-index values were 0.78 (95% CI 0.75–0.81) in training set and 0.72 (95% CI 0.66–0.78) in validation set. The calibration curves were closer to ideal curves indicated the accurate predictive ability of this nomogram. The elderly patients with EEM in the low-risk group showed a longer OS than patients in the high-risk group in both training and validation cohorts.ConclusionsOur study established and validated a novel model to predict 1-, 3- and 5-year OS for EEM. The individualized nomogram has a good prognostic ability and can be used as a new survival prediction tool for the elderly patients with EMM.",0
"Ewing’s sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour is a malignant small round blue cell tumour of neuroectodermal origin that affects bones and soft tissue in children and young adults. These are aggressive malignant tumours, and long-term survival rates following diagnosis remain poor. Occurrence of primitive neuroectodermal tumours in the head and neck region is uncommon. It is extremely rare in the larynx with only 12 cases reported in the literature. We report a case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the larynx in a 28-year-old female. She presented with hoarseness of voice, and her computed tomography and laryngoscopy revealed a mass at the laryngeal inlet. A biopsy followed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of a primitive neuroectodermal tumour. She initially defaulted from treatment and subsequently presented with stridor for which an emergency tracheostomy was done. Her metastatic workup did not reveal any lesion elsewhere. So, a diagnosis of a primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the larynx was made, and the patient was started on treatment.","Cadmium is a well-known toxic heavy metal that poses significant health risks, particularly through inhalation, smoking, and the consumption of contaminated food. Exposure to cadmium is linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the systemic effects of intratracheal cadmium chloride (0.5 mg/kg) instillation in C57BL/6 mice. All parameters, including inflammation assessment, lung function evaluation (using Flexi-vent), and immunophenotyping of T-cells in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes), were analyzed 14 days after Cd exposure. The results demonstrated that cadmium exposure led to significant immune cell infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, altered pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and was associated with impaired lung function, characterized by increased lung resistance and Newtonian resistance. Analysis of T-cell populations revealed no significant changes in total T-cells in mediastinal lymph nodes and spleen, but a decrease in CD4+ T-cells and an increase in CD8+ T-cells were observed. These findings suggest that cadmium disrupts T-cell homeostasis in secondary lymphoid organs. Further research is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced lung injury and immune dysregulation, essential for developing effective therapeutic interventions against chronic lung diseases caused by cadmium exposure.",0
"AbstractAIMSThe QUARTZ trial  reported that corticosteroid therapy was non-inferior to whole brain radiotherapy(WBRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with regards overall survival(OS). This is a single centre experience of WBRT for NSCLC in the post-QUARTZ era and in the context of the changes in clinical practice over the past 8 years.METHODSingle centre retrospective observational study. Patients included with NSCLC treated with WBRT for radiologically conﬁrmed intracranial (IC) metastatic disease January 2018 to December 2022. OS, baseline tumour/patient characteristics and lines of treatment were recorded from medical records. Data compiled using Excel and statistical analysis using the R language for statistical programming.RESULTS62 patients were included, median age 64 (37 -82). 29(46.8%) were Performance status 0-1. 50(80.6%) received 20Gy in 5 fractions, 12(19.4%) received 30Gy in 10 fractions. PDL1 >50% in 14(22.6%), EGFR mutation positive in 10(16.1%), 0(0%) ALK/ROS mutations. 9(14.5%) had received prior radiotherapy(RT) for IC disease (SRS:8, partial brain VMAT:1). 20(32.3%) had IC disease at presentation. Median OS 68 days (95%CI:58-111;range12-777) in keeping with QUARTZ results (median OS 65 days, 95%CI:50- 78). Univariate analyses demonstrated: subsequent systemic therapy (p=0.0022), receiving immunotherapy (p=0.002) and baseline performance status (p=0.0017) associated with improved OS. PDL1 >50%, EGFR mutation positive, RT dose, prior systemic therapy, histological subtype, presence of a targetable mutation, ﬁrst or subsequent IC treatment did not predict survival. The chi-squared test was used to compare differences in the groups with OS>100days(n=22) and OS<100days(n=40). Systemic therapy after WBRT(p=0.0011) and immunotherapy treatment(p=0.0092) were signiﬁcant differences between the cohorts and associated with improved survival.CONCLUSIONThis data supports conclusions of QUARTZ study and it remains diﬃcult to deﬁne a role for WBRT in the management of IC disease in NSCLC. There is a cohort who have better OS, though we believe this may be related to systemic therapy (particularly immunotherapy) exposure.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a significant challenge in clinical oncology due to its aggressive nature and limited targeted therapeutic options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has emerged as a promising strategy in the management of early-stage TNBC. This literature review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the role of NACT in TNBC, focusing on its impact on early-stage disease and associated outcomes. The review synthesizes evidence from recent studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses to present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of NACT in early-stage TNBC.",0
"Aim: Cu2O nanoparticles were synthesized using an extract from S. latifolium algae (SLCu2O NPs). Their effect on PANC-1 cells and the expression of two drug resistance-related lncRNAs were evaluated in comparison with Arsenic trioxide.Materials & methods: SLCu2O NPs were characterized using XRD, SEM, and TEM microscopies. The effects of SLCu2O NPs on cell cytotoxicity, cell cycle, and apoptosis, and expression of two drug resistance-related lncRNAs were examined using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR, respectively.Results: SLCu2O NPs demonstrated anti-cancer properties against PANC-1 cells comparable to Arsenic trioxide, and the expression of lncRNAs increased upon treatment with them.Conclusion: SLCu2O NPs demonstrate anti-cancer properties against PANC-1 cells; however, using gene silencing strategies along with SLCu2O NPs is suggested.","IntroductionTyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been used as the first-line treatment for many patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the seventh most common cancer in the United Kingdom. However, suboptimal adherence to TKIs can result in poor clinical prognosis. This study quantified RCC patients’ adherence to TKIs and explored factors associated with suboptimal adherence.MethodThis retrospective cohort study was conducted at a specialist oncology tertiary hospital in Northwest England, using pharmacy dispensing records between November 2021 and March 2022. TKI prescriptions dispensed to patients with RCC were extracted to calculate the persistency gaps (≥7 or ≥14 days) and medication possession ratio (MPR). Multilevel regression analysis was conducted to associate MPR and persistency gaps with specific patient-related and TKI-related factors. This study did not require ethics approval.ResultsOf the 2225 prescriptions dispensed to 109 patients, 469 (23.4%) and 274 (13.7%) persistency gaps of ≥7 and ≥14 days were identified. About 75% and 92% of patients had a persistency gap of ≥7 days within the first 90 days and 180 days. The length of time since the first TKI prescription (p < 0.001) and the use of sunitinib(p = 0.003) were significantly associated with the number of prescription gaps of ≥7 days. Moreover, the median MPR was 95.6% (interquartile range: 90.7%, 100.1%). Similarly, the length of time since the first TKI prescription was dispensed (p < 0.001) and the use of sunitinib (p = 0.034) were significantly associated with MPR.Discussion and conclusionThis single-centre study found that patients with RCC generally adhere to TKIs (MPR > 90%), but many patients experienced a persistency gap. The crucial window to mitigate TKI utilisation is within 180 days after the initial dispensing of TKIs. Further large-scale studies are required to comprehensively investigate other factors associated with adherence to TKIs and develop interventions to improve adherence and medication use problems.",0
"PurposeTo investigate the prognostic indicators, develop and verify nomograms for predicting overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in elderly patients with uterine serous carcinoma (USC).MethodsData of eligible USC patients aged ≥ 65 years from 2004 to 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database were collected for retrospective analysis. X-tile software was used to assess the optimal cut-off values. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to explore the prognostic factors. Nomograms were developed to predict the probability of 1-, 3- and 5-year OS and CSS. Concordance indexes (c-index), receiver operating characteristic analysis and calibration curves were used to evaluate the model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was introduced to examine the clinical value of the models.ResultsAge, Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, N stage, tumor size, number of lymph nodes resected, and adjuvant therapy were independent prognostic factors for OS and CSS. The C-indexes were 0.736 (OS), 0.754 (CSS) in the training set and 0.731 (OS), 0.759 (CSS) in the validation set. The area under the curve (AUCs) of OS and CSS for 1-, 3-, and 5-years all exceeded 0.75. The calibration plots for the probability of survival were in good agreement. As shown in DCA curves, the nomograms showed better discrimination power and higher net benefits than the 6th American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.ConclusionsThe nomograms constructed based on prognostic risk factors could individually predict the prognosis of elderly USC patients and provide a reference for clinical decision-making.","PurposeFluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel (FLOT) regimen has shown strong efficacy as perioperative therapy for patients with locally advanced gastric (GC) and gastroesophageal (AEG) carcinoma. In the palliative situation, FLOT is recommended only for young fit patients. Data of efficacy and tolerability of FLOT in elderly patients are scarce and controversial. Thus, this study aimed to provide real-life experience of elderly patients with GC and AEG treated with FLOT as first-line palliative chemotherapy.MethodsPatients with advanced or metastatic GC or AEG and treated with FLOT as first-line palliative therapy between 2010 and 2021 were analyzed. Patients were grouped into < 65 years old (n = 35) and ≥ 65 years old (n = 22) groups. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), feasibility and toxicity were analyzed.ResultsThe median OS was 10.4 months with no significant difference between both groups (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.48, 1.57; p = 0.632). The ECOG performance status showed powerful influence on OS in the subgroup analysis with median OS of 12.3 months for ECOG = 0 compared to 5.0 months for ECOG ≥ 1 (p = 0.015) as well as in multivariate analysis (HR 2.62; 95% CI 1.36, 5.04; p = 0.004).ConclusionIn the present study the ECOG performance status showed a stronger prognostic value than patient age in FLOT as first- line therapy in a real-life cohort with advanced and metastatic GC and AEG. The performance status should therefore be considered in the therapeutic decision making of elderly patients with GC and AEG.",1
"The tumor-associated antigen MUC1 is an attractive target for immunotherapy, however, its weak immunogenicity limits the induction of antitumor immune responses. To overcome this limitation, in this study, MUC1 glycopeptide was covalently linked with a diphtheria toxin-derived T-helper epitope (DT331–345). Subsequently, the resulting DT-MUC1 glycopeptide was physically mixed with natural killer T cell agonist αGalCer to explore their immunomodulatory synergy. Biological results demonstrated that compared to MUC1+αGalCer and DT-MUC1 groups, the specific IgG antibody titer of DT-MUC1+αGalCer group increased by 189- and 3-fold, respectively, indicating that the diphtheria toxin-derived T-helper epitope synergistically enhanced MUC1 immunogenicity with αGalCer. Moreover, the DT-MUC1+αGalCer vaccine induced potent cellular immune responses and significantly inhibited the growth of B16-MUC1 tumors in vivo. Furthermore, it was found that the anti-MUC1 IgG antibody titer induced by DT-MUC1+αGalCer was equivalent to that induced by palmitoylated DT-MUC1+αGalCer (P1-DT-MUC1+αGalCer) and significantly higher than that induced by doubly palmitoylated DT-MUC1+αGalCer (P2-DT-MUC1+αGalCer), suggesting that the easily synthesized DT-MUC1 may not require lipid chain modification and already possess good amphiphilicity. This is the first time that a diphtheria toxin-derived helper T-helper epitope was covalently linked to a glycopeptide antigen to enhance its immunogenicity, and this study may provide an effective vaccine design strategy for MUC1-targeted antitumor vaccines and offer novel insights into the design of fully synthetic peptide vaccines.","Adjuvants for vaccines with characteristics of improving adaptive immunity particularly via leverage of antigen presenting cells (APCs) are currently lacking. In a previous work we obtained a new soluble 300 kDa homogeneous β-glucan named GFPBW1 from the fruit bodies of Granola frondosa. GFPBW1 could activate macrophages by targeting dendritic cell associated C-type lectin 1 (Dectin-1)/Syk/NF-κB signaling to achieve antitumour effects. In this study the adjuvant effects of GFPBW1 were explored with OVA-antigen and B16-OVA tumor model. We showed that GFPBW1 (5, 50, 500 μg/mL) dose-dependently promoted activation and maturation of APCs in vitro by increasing CD80, CD86 and MHC II expression. We immunized female mice with OVA in combination with GFPBW1 (50 or 300 μg) twice with an interval of two weeks. GFPBW1 markedly and dose-dependently increased OVA-specific antibody titers of different subtypes including IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, suggesting that it could serve as an adjuvant for both Th1 and Th2 type immune responses. Furthermore, GFPBW1 in combination with aluminum significantly increased the titers of OVA-specific IgG2a and IgG2b, but not those of IgG1, suggesting that GFPBW1 could be used as a co-adjuvant of aluminum to compensate for Th1 deficiency. For mice immunized with OVA plus GFPBW1, no obvious pathological injury was observed in either major organs or injection sites, and no abnormalities were noted for any of the hematological parameters. When GFPBW1 served as an adjuvant in the B16-OVA cancer vaccine models, it could accomplish entire tumor suppression with preventive vaccines, and enhance antitumour efficacy with therapeutic vaccines. Differentially expressed genes were found to be enriched in antigen processing process, specifically increased tumor infiltration of DCs, B1 cells and plasma cells in the OVA plus GFPBW1 group, in accordance with its activation and maturation function of APCs. Collectively, this study systematically describes the properties of GFPBW1 as a novel potent and safe adjuvant and highlights its great potential in vaccine development.",1
"PurposeTumor spread through air space (STAS) is a novel pattern of invasion related to poor prognosis in non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, little is known about the role of STAS in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We sought to determine whether STAS has a significant effect on recurrence among SCLC patients.MethodsWe collected clinical and follow-up information from 181 resected stage I–III SCLC patients and compared overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the patients with or without STAS using the Kaplan‒Meier method. To explore the effect of STAS on recurrence, a competing-risk analysis was conducted.ResultsAmong 181 SCLC patients, STAS was observed in 56 (30.94%) patients, and 125 (69.06%) patients did not have STAS. Furthermore, 33 (18.23%) patients had recurrence, including 12 patients with brain metastases. Patients with STAS had worse DFS. The cumulative incidence of any recurrence was higher in patients with STAS than in those without STAS. Univariate and multivariate competing-risk regression analyses revealed that sublobar resection and STAS were independent risk factors for SCLC recurrence (p = 0.009 and p = 0.029 for multivariate analysis, respectively).ConclusionSCLC patients with STAS have worse DFS than SCLC patients without STAS. STAS is an independent prognostic factor in SCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04462-8.","PurposeThis study aimed to assess the cumulative incidences of Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)-specific mortality (NMSC-SM) and develop a competing risk nomogram for NMSC-SM.MethodsData on patients diagnosed with NMSC between 2010 and 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. To identify the independent prognostic factors, univariate and multivariate competing risk models were used, and a competing risk model was constructed. Based on the model, we developed a competing risk nomogram to predict the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year cumulative probabilities of NMSC-SM. The precision and ability to discriminate of the nomogram were evaluated through the utilization of metrics, such as receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), concordance index (C-index), and a calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to assess the clinical usefulness of the nomogram.ResultsRace, age, the primary site of the tumor, tumor grade, size, histological type, summary stage, stage group, order of radiation and surgery, and bone metastases were identified as independent risk factors. The prediction nomogram was constructed using the variables mentioned above. The ROC curves implied the good discrimination ability of the predictive model. The nomogram's C-index was 0.840 and 0.843 in the training and validation sets, respectively, and the calibration plots were well fitted. In addition, the competing risk nomogram demonstrated good clinical usefulness. ConclusionThe competing risk nomogram displayed excellent discrimination and calibration for predicting NMSC-SM, which can be used in clinical contexts to help guide treatment decisions.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04826-8.",1
"BackgroundPatients with glioma have limited treatment options and experience poor prognoses. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the relevance of WSC domain-containing 2 (WSCD2) expression to glioma, clinicopathological characteristics, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TILs), and patient prognosis.MethodsWe analyzed WSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues and patient survival using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. Furthermore, the relationship between the expressions of WSCD2 mRNA and TILs in gliomas was evaluated utilizing the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Lastly, we employed multiplex immunohistochemistry to detect the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues.ResultsWSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues was lower than that in tissues of benign brain disease. High WSCD2 mRNA expression was also significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, WSCD2 mRNA expression was correlated with TIL expression in glioma; however, no such relationship was detected between the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues. Cox regression multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that WSCD2 expression in glioma tissues could be an independent prognostic factor.ConclusionThis study highlights the correlation between WSCD2 expression and TILs and demonstrates the prognostic significance of WSCD2 in glioma. Furthermore, our results suggest that WSCD2 may be a potential immunotherapy target in glioma.","Aim: To investigate the prognostic value of inflammatory markers in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).Materials & methods: The infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in tissue microarrays from 180 patients who underwent radical esophagectomy was detected using immunohistochemistry. A separate cohort of 351 patients with metastatic/recurrent or unresectable ESCC treated with ICIs was enrolled for further investigation. The overall survival difference among groups was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to investigate the prognostic impact of the inflammatory markers, along with other factors.Results: Decreased inflammation was found to be associated with increased CD3+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration and a better prognosis. Then, the value of inflammatory markers in predicting survival in 351 ESCC patients receiving immunotherapy was validated. Ultimately, the systemic immune-inflammation index was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Additionally, the patients with no distant organ metastasis, or treated by first-line immunotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy can considerably prolong survival.Conclusion: Inflammation is associated with the level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and that the systemic immune-inflammation index is an effective prognostic predictor for ESCC patients treated with ICIs.",1
"AbstractBackgroundWe examined the relationship between neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cognition in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at baseline and longitudinally.MethodsPlasma and clinical data were available from virally suppressed people with HIV (PWH) aged ≥45 years in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group HAILO study. Four neuropsychological assessments standardized and averaged (NPZ-4) represented cognition. Plasma collection date marked baseline; slope summarized longitudinal NPZ-4 changes. Linear regressions examined biomarkers associations with baseline NPZ-4 and longitudinal change.ResultsThe study included 503 participants with a median age of 52 (interquartile range [IQR, 48–57]) years and observation of 6 (IQR, 5–7) years, and 26% had baseline cognitive impairment defined by HAILO. Cross-sectionally, higher NfL (β = −.76, P < .01) and GFAP (β = −.44, P = .02) were associated with worse NPZ-4. Longitudinally, the median NPZ-4 slope was 0.003 (IQR, −0.06 to 0.06) units/year with 48% demonstrating cognitive decline. Higher NfL (β = −.08, P < .01), but not GFAP (β = −.03, P = .08), was associated with cognitive decline.ConclusionsNfL and GFAP were associated with worse cognition cross-sectionally; only NfL was associated with cognitive decline. Their clinical utility remains uncertain given small effect sizes and should be studied in populations with more rapid decline.","A larger percentage of our population is aging healthily and living on to a ripe old age. 60 years of age is taken as cut-off for identifying geriatric population for the purpose of specialized healthcare. The incidence of cancer is increasing and its expected more so in the geriatric population. At present , there are a limited cancer centres where specialized geriatric clinic is being conducted.Some of the the key unmet needs are — lack of resources and time for dedicated geriatric screening, lack of validated interventions and lack of awareness about the field of geriatric oncology. Some of the proposed solutions are increasing orientation and exposure of trainees and early career oncologists as well as carrying out country specific research to find useful interventions in this field.",1
"ABSTRACTMillions of people worldwide suffer from cancer, facing challenges such as treatments affecting healthy cells, suboptimal responses, adverse effects, recurrence risk, drug resistance, and nonspecific targeting. Chemoresistance leads to fatalities, but phytoactives show promise in cancer management despite limitations such as high metabolism, poor absorption, and high dosage requirements. Challenges in the large-scale isolation of phytoactive compounds, solubility, bioavailability, and targeting limit their development. Recent developments, including carbohydrate, lipid, and protein-based nanoparticles, have enhanced cancer treatment by improving the bioavailability and targeted delivery of phytoactives such as polyphenols, alkaloids, sulfur-containing compounds, flavonoids, and terpenes. Despite advancements, clinical application faces hurdles such as poor bioavailability and inconsistent immune responses. This article discusses the promise of phytoactive-loaded nanoformulations in cancer management, highlighting targeted drug delivery, unmet needs, and challenges. Further research is needed to overcome these challenges and fully understand the potential of phytoactives in cancer management.","ABSTRACTBackgroundRecently, we developed AT101, an IgM-class mouse monoclonal antibody directed against glypican-1 (GPC1), a proteoglycan that can be considered as useful target for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment being specifically and highly expressed on GBM cell surface. Here, we proposed the use of AT101 as targeting agent in a drug delivery nanoplatfom to effectively deliver chitosan nanobubbles (NBs) for GBM treatment.MethodsChitosan NBs were prepared and conjugated with AT101 or left unconjugated as control.ResultsThe ability of AT101 to bind the GPC1 protein was demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis in the “GBM-like” GPC1-expressing cell lines U-87 MG and T98G. AT101 was shown to bind GPC1-expressing GBM tumor samples by immunofluorescence. In-vivo experiments in the U-87 MG xenograft model showed that AT101 was able to bind GPC1 on cell surface and accumulate in U-87 MG tumor masses (p = 0.0002 respect to control). Moreover, in-vivo experiments showed that AT101 is able to target GPC1 when conjugated to chitosan NBs, thus increasing their specific deliver to GPC1-expressing cells of U-87 MG tumor, as compared to chitosan NBs not conjugated to AT101 (p = 0.02).ConclusionsAT101 is an useful targeting agent for the development of drug delivery nanoplatforms for GBM treatment.",1
"AbstractRationale:Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare tumor with a poor prognosis and has no recommended therapy after first-line pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on peritoneal mesothelioma remains to be elucidated. We herein report the case of a 75-year-old man with peritoneal mesothelioma treated with cisplatin plus pemetrexed and subsequent nivolumab.Patient concerns:A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to lower abdominal pain.Diagnosis:Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (CT) showed the accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in an intraperitoneal mass. A histological examination of a laparoscopic biopsy specimen revealed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.Interventions:After 4 cycles of cisplatin plus pemetrexed and 13 subsequent cycles of pemetrexed maintenance therapy showed beneficial responses until CT revealed liver metastasis. Nivolumab was then administered as the second-line therapy.Outcomes:After 3 cycles of biweekly nivolumab administration, he developed severe abdominal distention. CT revealed an intraperitoneal mass growing much more rapidly than ever, indicating hyperprogressive disease after nivolumab treatment. He ultimately died 51 days after the initial nivolumab administration.Lessons:To our knowledge, this is the first report of hyperprogressive disease in a case of peritoneal mesothelioma after nivolumab treatment. While immune checkpoint inhibitors may be promising therapeutic strategies for treating malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, careful monitoring must be practiced with their application.","A 69-year-old woman with left-sided breast cancer developed elevated creatine kinase levels and muscle weakness in her extremities after treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient was diagnosed with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related myositis. Although the patient had no symptoms of dysphagia, we evaluated her swallowing function because esophageal dysfunction is a known complication of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study detected barium residues in the lower esophagus. Furthermore, high-resolution manometry showed impaired upper esophageal sphincter opening and absence of esophageal peristalsis, which improved partially after immunotherapy. These findings suggest that esophageal dysfunction may be an unrecognized complication of ICI-related myositis.",1
"In the tumor microenvironment, adipocytes function as an alternate fuel source for cancer cells. However, whether adipocytes influence macromolecular biosynthesis in cancer cells is unknown. Here we systematically characterized the bidirectional interaction between primary human adipocytes and ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells using multi-platform metabolomics, imaging mass spectrometry, isotope tracing and gene expression analysis. We report that, in OvCa cells co-cultured with adipocytes and in metastatic tumors, a part of the glucose from glycolysis is utilized for the biosynthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). Normoxic HIF1α protein regulates the altered flow of glucose-derived carbons in cancer cells, resulting in increased glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerol synthesis. The knockdown of HIF1α or G3P acyltransferase 3 (a regulatory enzyme of glycerophospholipid synthesis) reduced metastasis in xenograft models of OvCa. In summary, we show that, in an adipose-rich tumor microenvironment, cancer cells generate G3P as a precursor for critical membrane and signaling components, thereby promoting metastasis. Targeting biosynthetic processes specific to adipose-rich tumor microenvironments might be an effective strategy against metastasis.","AbstractPurposeHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is a critical biomarker in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). While the role of HER2-positive tumors in guiding targeted therapies is well-established, the clinical implications of HER2-low expression, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization-negative (ISH-negative), remain undetermined. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance and clinicopathological features of HER2-low AGC.Patients and methodsThis retrospective analysis involved patients with AGC treated with first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy from 2011 to 2020. Patients were categorized into HER2-zero (HER2 IHC 0), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-negative), and HER2-positive (IHC 2+/ISH-positive or 3+) groups.ResultsAmong 548 patients analyzed, 33.0%, 45.1%, and 21.8% were classified as HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive, respectively. The proportions of male patients, intestinal-type histology, esophagogastric junction/cardia involvement, metastatic disease status, ≥2 metastatic sites, liver metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and high serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels were gradually elevated in the HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive groups. Overall survival (median) was 13.8, 13.6, and 23.0 months, respectively, with a non-significant trend favoring HER2-positive over HER2-low (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.80; P = .0672). A delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival between the HER2-zero and HER2-low groups was observed, without reaching statistical significance (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.12; P = .2568).ConclusionPatients with HER2-low status exhibited intermediate and specific clinicopathological features within the HER2-negative category. In terms of prognosis, HER2-low patients showed a worsening trend compared with HER2-positive patients. This evidence implies that HER2-low status represents a distinct clinical subset, bridging the gap between the HER2-zero and HER2-positive profiles.",0
"Antibody inhibitors pose an ongoing challenge to the treatment of subjects with inherited protein deficiency disorders, limiting the efficacy of both protein replacement therapy and corrective gene therapy. Beyond their central role as producers of serum antibody, B cells also exhibit many unique properties that could be exploited in cell therapy applications, notably including antigen-specific recognition and the linked capacity for antigen presentation. Here we employed CRISPR-Cas9 to demonstrate that ex vivo antigen-primed Blimp1-knockout “decoy” B cells, incapable of differentiation into plasma cells, participated in and downregulated host antigen-specific humoral responses after adoptive transfer. Following ex vivo antigen pulse, adoptively transferred high-affinity antigen-specific decoy B cells were diverted into germinal centers en masse, thereby reducing participation by endogenous antigen-specific B cells in T-dependent humoral responses and suppressing both cognate and linked antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G following immunization with conjugated antigen. This effect was dose-dependent and, importantly, did not impact concurrent unrelated antibody responses. We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of this approach by treating factor VIII (FVIII)-knockout mice with antigen-pulsed decoy B cells prior to immunization with an FVIII conjugate protein, thereby blunting the production of serum FVIII-specific IgG by an order of magnitude as well as reducing the proportion of animals exhibiting functional FVIII inhibition by 6-fold.","Muscle-invasive bladder tumors pose a grave mortality risk due to their propensity for distant metastases. The therapeutic spectrum for such tumors encompasses surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, tailored to the cancer’s severity. In the context of high-risk Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), a novel treatment has emerged as a beacon of hope. Nadofaragene firadenovec, a pioneering gene therapy, has gained worldwide approval for combating this condition, marking a watershed moment in bladder cancer therapy. Nadofaragene firadenovec is ingeniously designed to address high-risk BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, particularly carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors, in adult patients. Rooted in a vector DNA, this therapy encodes interferon (IFN)-2b, which imparts urothelial cells with the ability to generate IFN-2b. The resulting cascade of events triggers a multifaceted assault on cancer, characterized by its immunostimulatory, antiangiogenic, and apoptotic effects. The therapeutic efficacy of nadofaragene firadenovec rests on its capacity to exploit the transformed urothelial cells to deliver these targeted anticancer activities. The evolutionary trajectory of nadofaragene firadenovec culminated in its monumental approval in December 2022 by the United States, signifying a pivotal juncture in the field. Notably, a segment of patients, approximately 30%, prove refractory to BCG treatment. For these individuals, alternative therapeutic avenues are imperative. Presently, the landscape for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer lacks a definitive, enduring solution. Against this backdrop, the introduction of nadofaragene firadenovec heralds a momentous stride toward the global availability of an authorized therapeutic intervention.",1
"PurposeBaseline tumor size (BTS) and the presence of massive lesions are important for predicting the clinical course of cancer. However, their impact on survival and clinical response in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment has been scarcely investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 294 patients who underwent ICI therapy for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between January 2016 and July 2019.ResultsOf these 294 patients, 284 (96.6%) had at least one measurable lesion. Of these, 263 patients treated with ICI monotherapy were included in the analysis. The median total and maximum target lesion diameters were 96.5 mm and 49.1 mm, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) with massive lesions (max BTS > 50 mm, group A) and without massive lesions (max BTS ≤ 50 mm, group B) was 2.5 months (95% CI 1.8–3.7) and 6.7 months (95% CI 5.1–9.7), respectively. Median overall survival (OS) for groups A and B was 9.5 months (95% CI 5.5–12.3) and 20.0 months (95% CI 13.3–32.0), respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between the presence of massive lesions and both PFS and OS.ConclusionThe presence of massive lesions (max diameters > 50 mm) is an independent prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC treated with ICI monotherapy. Although overall response rates were similar between groups A and B, the disease control rate was significantly poorer for group A. Max BTS might be useful for predicting clinical outcomes for patients undergoing immunotherapy as a parameter reflecting their tumor burden.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03271-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"PurposeThree dimensional (3D) “in vitro” models are progressively being applied to investigate tumor cell biology and the interaction of cancer cells with tumor microenvironment under conditions more similar and realistic to “in vivo” behavior than standard bidimensional (2D) cultures.MethodsIn the last years, different methods have been developed to create spheroids and organoids and each technique has advantages and limitations also based on individual needs and cell types used. This review offers an overview of methodologies used for 3D systems: scaffold-free and scaffold-based methods up to bioreactors and organ-on-chip models.ResultsThe principal goal for researchers is to select the 3D system that best suits their needs and that reflects the tumor model they want to study. A large chapter is dedicated to the application of these models to lymphomas’ study, a neoplasm still little explored in the 3D field.ConclusionThese innovative and advanced models may represent new tools for cancer research and pre-clinical studies of new therapies in the perspective of precision medicine.","Despite significant advancement in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of breast carcinoma, the prognosis remains dismal. Recently, with advances in its understanding, various immune system-based management strategies have been developed. CTLA-4 suppresses lymphocyte reactivity, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2 receptor expression and triggers cell cycle arrest. PD-L1 inhibits the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibits release of cytokines. Hence, we planned to evaluate the immunoexpression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in invasive ductal carcinoma breast and seek correlation between their immunopositivity and the clinicopathological parameters. This was a retrospective study conducted on archival material of 50 cases of breast carcinoma tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological details were recorded. All cases were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Cytoplasmic expression of CTLA-4 and membranous expression of PD-L1 were considered positive and staining intensity was recorded as mild, moderate, and intense. Data was recorded and analyzed. Immunopositivity for CTLA-4 was seen in 92% of cases of breast carcinoma. CTLA-4 staining intensity showed significant association with TNM staging of breast carcinomas (p = 0.036). Age group of the breast carcinoma cases showed a statistically significant correlation with PD-L1 immunoexpression (p = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between all other clinicopathological characteristics and CTLA-4 or PD-L1 immunostaining. Our study shows that CTLA-4 is a more important immune checkpoint regulator in breast carcinomas in comparison to PD-L1. Thus, anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy might prove to be of immense help in the treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma breast showing overexpression of CTLA-4.",0
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent a major advance in the treatment of cancer. Most studies of ICI have underestimated their cardiotoxicity; however, an increasing number of cases of cardiotoxicity are being reported. Herein we discussed a 67-year-old, male, Japanese patient who presented with cardiogenic shock accompanied by sick sinus syndrome 4 days into his second course of ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination therapy. A temporary transvenous pacemaker was subsequently placed, and a permanent pacemaker was implanted for persistent, symptomatic, intermittent bradycardia. The permanent implantation of the pacemaker improved his symptoms and allowed him to continue his ICI therapy.","BackgroundGiven the widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), newer immune related adverse events (irAEs) have come to light, including flare-ups of preexisting autoimmune disorders (AIDs) and delayed immune-related events. We aimed to identify the frequency and severity of new IRAEs, including AID flares in cancer patients treated with ICIs at our institution. We also studied the tolerability of ICIs upon rechallenge in patients with irAEs and hospital admissions due to irAEs in a community setting in rural Maine.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective chart review analysis of all patients with cancer who received anti-PDL1/PDL1 inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab at our tertiary care center from November 2015 to March 2019. Demographic data, cancer type and stage, irAEs, hospital admissions due to irAEs, and drug treatment information was extracted.ResultsWe included 465 patients who received ICIs, 115 (out of 465 25%) developed new irAEs. Preexisting AID were identified in 47 (out of 465) (10%), AID flares were observed in 12 patients (25% of 47). 17 (out of 47 36%) were on immunosuppression for underlying AID, 5 (out of 17, 29%) developed flares. Overall, 148 (32% of 465) irAEs occurred, as some patients had multiple toxicities. Majority were treated for Lung cancer (63%), followed by melanoma and genitourinary cancers. Due to irAE severity, treatment was permanently discontinued in 15% (out of 465) patients. Hospital admissions due to irAEs were required for 34 patients (7.3% of 465). ICI rechallenge was performed in 27 patients (6% of 465), and majority tolerated well.ConclusionOur study shows that ICIs were generally well tolerated and can be used safely even in patients with preexisting AIDs; it is encouraging to see majority tolerated rechallenge with ICIs well.",1
"BackgroundPan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) is an easily accessible immune marker based on peripheral blood to estimate prognosis in patients with cancer. This study evaluates the prognostic value of PIV in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with nivolumab.MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab in the second line and beyond were selected from the Turkish Oncology Group Kidney Cancer Consortium (TKCC) database. PIV was calculated using the following formula: neutrophil (103/mm3) x monocyte (103/mm3) x platelet (103/mm3)/lymphocyte (103/mm3).ResultsA total of 152 patients with mRCC were included in this study. According to cut-off value for PIV, 77 (50.7%) and 75 (49.3%) patients fell into PIV-low (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\le$$\end{document}≤ 372) and PIV-high (> 372) groups, respectively. In multivariate analysis, PIV-high (HR: 1.64, 95% CI 1.04–2.58, p = 0.033 for overall survival (OS); HR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.02–2.38, p = 0.042 for progression-free survival (PFS)) was independent risk factor for OS and PFS after adjusting for confounding variables, such as performance score, the International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk score, and liver metastasis.ConclusionThis study established that pre-treatment PIV might be a prognostic biomarker in patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab in the second line and beyond.","AbstractThe advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented potential for the targeted manipulation of DNA sequences. Advances in the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas9 system allowed potential applicability for the treatment of genetic diseases. CRISPR-Cas9’s mechanism of action involves the use of an RNA guide molecule to target-specific DNA sequences and the Cas9 enzyme to induce precise DNA cleavage. In the context of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, this review covers nonviral delivery methods for gene editing based on peptide internalization. Here, we describe critical areas of discussion such as immunogenicity, emphasizing the importance of safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the context of treating single-mutation genetic diseases using advanced editing techniques genetics as prime editor and base editor. The text discusses the versatility of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) in forming complexes for delivering biomolecules, particularly ribonucleoprotein for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells. In addition, it emphasizes the promise of combining CPPs with DNA base editing and prime editing systems. These systems, known for their simplicity and precision, hold great potential for correcting point mutations in human genetic diseases. In summary, the text provides a clear overview of the advantages of using CPPs for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9, particularly in conjunction with advanced editing systems, highlighting their potential impact on clinical applications in the treatment of single-mutation genetic diseases.",0
"Aim: We aimed to investigate the predictive value of the Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) expression from circulating blood for recurrence, metastasis and overall death on patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Materials & Methods: We collected blood samples from 122 patients who were admitted to our hospital for NSCLC.Results: Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis in adjusted Model II showed that compared with GRHL2-negative expression, positive expression in patients with NSCLC was associated with increased death risk (HR = 7.0, 95% CI: 2.1–20.9, p = 0.03) and risk for composite end point (HR = 8.2, 95% CI: 4.0–27.1, p <0.01).Conclusion: This study supported that elevated circulating GRHL2 expression might be considered as a candidate prognostic biomarker for poor prognosis among these NSCLC patients.","IntroductionImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and has generated remarkable clinical results against multiple malignancies. Exploration of new technical approaches to further boost the therapeutic efficacy of ICB is of potential medical importance. In this study, we designed a novel nanotherapeutics for ICB immunotherapy.MethodsCTLA-4 aptamers were conjugated to the surface of albumin nanoparticle to construct an aptamer-modified nanostructure (Apt-NP). To improve ICB efficacy, fexofenadine (FEXO), an antihistamine, was encapsulated into Apt-NP to make a drug-loaded nanoparticle (Apt-NP-FEXO). The antitumor efficacies of Apt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsApt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO had average diameters of 149 nm and 159 nm, respectively. Similar to free CTLA-4 aptamers, Apt-modified NPs could selectively bind with CTLA-4 positive cells and improve lymphocyte-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity in vitro. In animal studies, compared with free CTLA-4 aptamer, Apt-NP significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Moreover, Apt-NP-FEXO further improved antitumor efficacy vs. Apt-NP in vivo.ConclusionThe results suggest that Apt-NP-FEXO represents a novel strategy to improve ICB outcome and may have application potential in cancer immunotherapy.",0
"Cancer metabolic reprogramming has been considered an emerging hallmark in tumorigenesis and the antitumor immune response. Like cancer cells, immune cells within the tumor microenvironment or premetastatic niche also undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming, which profoundly impacts anti-tumor immune responses. Numerous evidence has illuminated that immunosuppressive TME and the metabolites released by tumor cells, including lactic acid, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), fatty acids (FAs), cholesterol, D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), adenosine (ADO), and kynurenine (KYN) can contribute to CD8+ T cell dysfunction. Dynamic alterations of these metabolites between tumor cells and immune cells can similarly initiate metabolic competition in the TME, leading to nutrient deprivation and subsequent microenvironmental acidosis, which impedes immune response. This review summarizes the new landscape beyond the classical metabolic pathways in tumor cells, highlighting the pivotal role of metabolic disturbance in the immunosuppressive microenvironment, especially how nutrient deprivation in TME leads to metabolic reprogramming of CD8+ T cells. Likewise, it emphasizes the current therapeutic targets or strategies related to tumor metabolism and immune response, providing therapeutic benefits for tumor immunotherapy and drug development in the future. Cancer metabolic reprogramming has been considered an emerging hallmark in tumorigenesis and the antitumor immune response. Dynamic alterations of metabolites between tumor cells and immune cells initiate metabolic competition in the TME, leading to nutrient deprivation and subsequent microenvironmental acidosis, which impedes immune response.","BackgroundThe High Mobility Group Nucleosomal Binding Domain 1 Gene (HMGN1) is crucial for epigenetic regulation. However, the specific function of HMGN1 in cancer development is unclear.MethodsRaw data on HMGN1 expression were procured from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), the University of Alabama- Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thereafter, the pan-cancer analysis was implemented to understand the HMGN1 expression patterns, prognostic value, and immunological features. Furthermore, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was executed via R language. In addition, the relationship between HMGN1 and the sensitivity of antitumor drugs was also determined. Finally, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were carried out.ResultsPan-cancer analysis revealed that HMGN1 was upregulated in several solid tumors and was associated with pathological staging and poor prognosis. In addition, HMGN1 was found to be involved in regulating the tumor microenvironment. The GSEA enrichment analysis indicated that HMGN1 assisted in the regulation of oncogenic processes, especially metabolic and immune pathways. Furthermore, HMGN1 expression was linked to microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) across diverse tumor types. RT-PCR assays indicated that HMGN1 was overexpressed in the gastric and breast cancer cell lines and tissues.ConclusionThis study highlighted the potential of HMGN1 as a biomarker for pan-cancer analysis.",1
"AbstractBackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies targeting glioblastoma (GBM)-associated antigens such as interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL-13Rα2) have achieved limited clinical efficacy to date, in part due to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by inhibitory molecules such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). The aim of this study was to engineer more potent GBM-targeting CAR-T cells by countering TGF-β-mediated immune suppression in the TME.MethodsWe engineered a single-chain, bispecific CAR targeting IL-13Rα2 and TGF-β, which programs tumor-specific T cells to convert TGF-β from an immunosuppressant to an immunostimulant. Bispecific IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells were evaluated for efficacy and safety against both patient-derived GBM xenografts and syngeneic models of murine glioma.ResultsTreatment with IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells leads to greater T-cell infiltration and reduced suppressive myeloid cell presence in the tumor-bearing brain compared to treatment with conventional IL-13Rα2 CAR-T cells, resulting in improved survival in both patient-derived GBM xenografts and syngeneic models of murine glioma.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that by reprogramming tumor-specific T-cell responses to TGF-β, bispecific IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells resist and remodel the immunosuppressive TME to drive potent anti-tumor responses in GBM.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown limited success in patients with solid tumors. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have shown that adrenoceptor beta-2 (ADRB2) is a novel checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. To inhibit ADRB2-mediated inhibitory signaling, we downregulated ADRB2 in CAR-T (shβ2-CAR-T) cells via RNA interference, assessed different parameters, and compared them with conventional second-generation CAR-T cells. ADRB2 knockdown CAR-T cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, by increasing CD69, CD107a, GzmB, IFN-γ, T-bet, and GLUT-1. In addition, ADRB2 deficiency led to improved proliferation, increased CD8/CD4 T cell ratio, and decreased apoptosis in CAR-T cells. shβ2-CAR-T cells expressed more Bcl-2 and led to the generation of more significant proportions of T central memory cells. Finally, the ZAP-70/NF-κB signaling axis was shown to be responsible for the improved functions of novel CAR-T cells. In tumor-bearing mice, shβ2-CAR-T cells performed better than conventional CAR-T cells in eradicating prostate tumors. The study provides the basis for future clinical and translational CAR-T cell research to focus on adrenergic stress-mediated challenges in the tumor microenvironment of stressed tumors.",1
"Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies, with improved survival. These monoclonal antibodies target immune checkpoints, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (ipilimumab and tremelimumab), programmed death 1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, and dostarlimab), programmed death ligand 1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab), and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (relatlimab), and effectively augment the immune response against tumor cells. Releasing the brakes on the immune system has consequences, however, in the form of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which may affect any organ. Neurologic irAEs represent 1%–3% of all irAEs, with immune-mediated myopathy (ICI myopathy) being the most common manifestation. Recent large patient series and systematic reviews have established the key features and highlighted new insights into ICI myopathy. ICI myopathy is characterized by an acute or subacute onset of oculobulbar and/or proximal limb weakness, with or without associated respiratory insufficiency and myocarditis. Creatine kinase elevation is common. Oculobulbar presentations with or without respiratory failure may be misattributed to neuromuscular junction disorders, particularly because acetylcholine receptor antibodies are present in up to 40% of patients; however, an electrodiagnostic evidence of a defect of neuromuscular transmission is often absent even in patients with severe weakness, highlighting that the myopathic process is the driving force behind these presentations. Muscle histopathology commonly demonstrates a unique signature of multifocal clusters of necrotic and regenerating fibers, differentiating ICI myopathy from other autoimmune myopathies. Transcriptomic analysis has uncovered distinct subgroups within ICI myopathy, revealing varying degrees of type 1 and type 2 interferon pathway activation alongside notable upregulation of the interleukin (IL)-6 pathway in affected muscle tissue. This discovery presents a promising avenue for intervention through the use of therapies that suppress the interferon pathway and target IL-6 or its receptor. Despite clinical improvements with immunomodulatory therapy, with corticosteroids the mainstay of treatment, mortality remains high, particularly in those with associated myocarditis or respiratory failure requiring intubation, where mortality occurs in up to 50%. ICI withdrawal can lead to cancer progression and death, highlighting a need for improved approaches to ICI rechallenge, performed in limited patients with variable success to date.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a significant challenge in clinical oncology due to its aggressive nature and limited targeted therapeutic options.

"Changes in gut flora are associated with liver fibrosis. The interactions of host with intestinal flora are still unknown, with little research investigating such interactions with comprehensive multi-omics data. The present work analyzed and integrated large-scale multi-omics transcriptomics, microbiome, metabolome, and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from Kaempferol-treated and untreated control groups by advanced bioinformatics methods. This study concludes that kaempferol dose-dependently improved serum markers (like AST, ALT, TBil, Alb, and PT) and suppressed fibrosis markers (including HA, PC III, LN, α-SMA, and Collagen I), while kaempferol also increased body weight. Mechanistically, kaempferol improved the metabolic levels of intestinal flora dysbiosis and associated lipids. This was achieved by increasing the abundance of g__Robinsoniella, g__Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003, g__Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002, and 5-Methylcytidine, all-trans-5,6- Epoxyretinoic acid, LPI (18:0), LPI (20:4), etc. to achieve this. Kaemferol exerts anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects by down-regulating the Th17/IL-17 signaling pathway in PDGF-induced LX2 cells. In addition, kaempferol administration remarkably elevated CD4 + T and CD8 + T cellular proportions, thereby activating immune cells for protecting the body and controlling inflammatory conditions. The combined interaction of multiple data may explain how Kaempferol modulates the intestinal flora thereby remodeling the hepatocyte population and alleviating liver fibrosis.Graphical Abstract","PurposeTo demonstrate the biological function of Secreted Phosphoprotein 1(SPP1) and its immune suppressive role in the progression intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).MethodsWe collected 62,770 cells’ published transcriptome data of nine patients whose paired adjacent liver and tumor tissues were both available. We applied differential gene expression analysis to screen potential ICC marker genes, survival analysis to verify the prognostic value of SPP1, and correlation analysis to decipher factors that are related to SPP1 expression. The CellChat was used to distinguish interactions between cancer and T cells. CytoSig was applied to query cytokines that modulate CD44. Further, we established a proliferation score and correlated the score with inhibitory signals to determine the proliferation-suppressive function of SPP1-CD44.ResultsSPP1 expression is significantly upregulated in tumoral epitheliums, and patients with higher SPP1 expression have worse survival (P < 0.05). Tumor cells communicate with T cells via SPP1-CD44 interactions. The average expression of SPP1 in malignant cells (SPP1m) and CD44 in T cells (CD44t) is moderately negatively correlated with T cell proliferation score. Immunosuppressive cytokine TGFβ-3 identified as an inducer of CD44 and was significantly negatively correlated with proliferation score (R = − 0.88, P < 0.01), and the negative correlation was aggravated in samples with high CD44 expression.ConclusionSPP1 is a prognostic marker of ICC and is associated with the genome heterogeneity. SPP1-CD44 hinders sustained proliferation of T cells, but immunosuppressive T cells in the tumor microenvironment may evade this inhibition by reducing CD44 expression.

"Introduction:Controversy remains as to whether pathologic complete response (pCR) and major pathologic response (MPR) represent surrogate endpoints for event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in neoadjuvant trials for resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods:A search of PubMed and archives of international conference abstracts was performed from June 2017 through October 31, 2023. Studies incorporating a neoadjuvant arm with immune checkpoint blockade alone or in combination with chemotherapy were included. Those not providing information regarding pCR, MPR, EFS or OS were excluded. For trial level surrogacy, log Odds Ratios (OR)s for pCR and MPR and log Hazard Ratios (HR) for EFS and OS were analyzed using a linear regression model weighted by sample size. The regression coefficient and R2 with 95% CI were calculated by bootstrapping approach.Results:Seven randomized clinical trials were identified for a total of 2385 patients. At the patient level, the R2 of pCR and MPR with 2-year EFS were 0.82 (0.66–0.94) and 0.81 (0.63–0.93), respectively. OR of 2-year EFS rates by response status were 0.12 (0.07–0.19) and 0.11 (0.05–0.22), respectively. For 2-year OS, the R2 of pCR and MPR were 0.55 (0.09–0.98) and 0.52 (0.10–0.96), respectively. At trial level, R2 for association of OR for response and HR for EFS was 0.58 (0.00–0.97) and 0.61 (0.00–0.97), respectively.Conclusions:Our analyses demonstrate a robust correlation between pCR and MPR with 2-year EFS but not OS. Trial-level surrogacy was moderate but imprecise. More mature follow-up and data to assess the impact of study crossover are needed.","Background:The literature regarding clinical olfaction, olfactory loss, and olfactory dysfunction has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, with an exponential rise in the past year. There is substantial variability in the quality of this literature and a need to consolidate and critically review the evidence. It is with that aim that we have gathered experts from around the world to produce this International Consensus on Allergy and Rhinology: Olfaction (ICAR:O).Methods:Using previously described methodology, specific topics were developed relating to olfaction. Each topic was assigned a literature review, evidence-based review, or evidence-based review with recommendations format as dictated by available evidence and scope within the ICAR:O document. Following iterative reviews of each topic, the ICAR:O document was integrated and reviewed by all authors for final consensus.Results:The ICAR:O document reviews nearly 100 separate topics within the realm of olfaction, including diagnosis, epidemiology, disease burden, diagnosis, testing, etiology, treatment, and associated pathologies.Conclusion:This critical review of the existing clinical olfaction literature provides much needed insight and clarity into the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with olfactory dysfunction, while also clearly delineating gaps in our knowledge and evidence base that we should investigate further.",1
"Therapeutic outcomes in oncology may be aided by precision diagnostics that offer early detection, localization, and the opportunity to monitor response to therapy. Herein we report a multimodal nanosensor engineered to target tumors via acidosis, respond to proteases in the microenvironment to release urinary reporters, and (optionally) carry PET probes to enable localization of primary and metastatic cancer in mouse models of colorectal cancer. We present a paradigm wherein this multimodal sensor can be employed longitudinally to noninvasively assess burden of disease including tumor progression and response to chemotherapy. Specifically, we showed acidosis-mediated tumor insertion enhanced on-target release of MMP-responsive reporters in the urine. Subsequent on-demand loading of the radio-tracer 64Cu allowed pH-dependent tumor visualization, enabling enriched microenvironmental characterization when compared to the conventional metabolic tracer 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). Through tailored target specificities, this modular platform has the capacity to be engineered as a pan-cancer test that may guide treatment decisions for numerous tumor types.","BackgroundSurvival estimation for patients with symptomatic skeletal metastases ideally should be made before a type of local treatment has already been determined. Currently available survival prediction tools, however, were generated using data from patients treated either operatively or with local radiation alone, raising concerns about whether they would generalize well to all patients presenting for assessment. The Skeletal Oncology Research Group machine-learning algorithm (SORG-MLA), trained with institution-based data of surgically treated patients, and the Metastases location, Elderly, Tumor primary, Sex, Sickness/comorbidity, and Site of radiotherapy model (METSSS), trained with registry-based data of patients treated with radiotherapy alone, are two of the most recently developed survival prediction models, but they have not been tested on patients whose local treatment strategy is not yet decided.Questions/purposes Which of these two survival prediction models performed better in a mixed cohort made up both of patients who received local treatment with surgery followed by radiotherapy and who had radiation alone for symptomatic bone metastases?  Which model performed better among patients whose local treatment consisted of only palliative radiotherapy?  Are laboratory values used by SORG-MLA, which are not included in METSSS, independently associated with survival after controlling for predictions made by METSSS?MethodsBetween 2010 and 2018, we provided local treatment for 2113 adult patients with skeletal metastases in the extremities at an urban tertiary referral academic medical center using one of two strategies:  surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy or  palliative radiotherapy alone. Every patient’s survivorship status was ascertained either by their medical records or the national death registry from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Administration. After applying a priori designated exclusion criteria, 91%  were analyzed here. Among them, 48%  of the patients were female, and the median (IQR) age was 62 years (53 to 70 years). Lung was the most common primary tumor site (41% ), and 59%  of patients had other skeletal metastases in addition to the treated lesion(s). In general, the indications for surgery were the presence of a complete pathologic fracture or an impending pathologic fracture, defined as having a Mirels score of ≥ 9, in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of less than or equal to IV and who were considered fit for surgery. The indications for radiotherapy were relief of pain, local tumor control, prevention of skeletal-related events, and any combination of the above. In all, 84%  of the patients received palliative radiotherapy alone as local treatment for the target lesion(s), and 16%  underwent surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. Neither METSSS nor SORG-MLA was used at the point of care to aid clinical decision-making during the treatment period. Survival was retrospectively estimated by these two models to test their potential for providing survival probabilities. We first compared SORG to METSSS in the entire population. Then, we repeated the comparison in patients who received local treatment with palliative radiation alone. We assessed model performance by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration analysis, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The AUROC measures discrimination, which is the ability to distinguish patients with the event of interest (such as death at a particular time point) from those without. AUROC typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating random guessing and 1.0 a perfect prediction, and in general, an AUROC of ≥ 0.7 indicates adequate discrimination for clinical use. Calibration refers to the agreement between the predicted outcomes (in this case, survival probabilities) and the actual outcomes, with a perfect calibration curve having an intercept of 0 and a slope of 1. A positive intercept indicates that the actual survival is generally underestimated by the prediction model, and a negative intercept suggests the opposite (overestimation). When comparing models, an intercept closer to 0 typically indicates better calibration. Calibration can also be summarized as log(O:E), the logarithm scale of the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) survivors. A log(O:E) > 0 signals an underestimation (the observed survival is greater than the predicted survival); and a log(O:E) < 0 indicates the opposite (the observed survival is lower than the predicted survival). A model with a log(O:E) closer to 0 is generally considered better calibrated. The Brier score is the mean squared difference between the model predictions and the observed outcomes, and it ranges from 0 (best prediction) to 1 (worst prediction). The Brier score captures both discrimination and calibration, and it is considered a measure of overall model performance. In Brier score analysis, the “null model” assigns a predicted probability equal to the prevalence of the outcome and represents a model that adds no new information. A prediction model should achieve a Brier score at least lower than the null-model Brier score to be considered as useful. The DCA was developed as a method to determine whether using a model to inform treatment decisions would do more good than harm. It plots the net benefit of making decisions based on the model’s predictions across all possible risk thresholds (or cost-to-benefit ratios) in relation to the two default strategies of treating all or no patients. The care provider can decide on an acceptable risk threshold for the proposed treatment in an individual and assess the corresponding net benefit to determine whether consulting with the model is superior to adopting the default strategies. Finally, we examined whether laboratory data, which were not included in the METSSS model, would have been independently associated with survival after controlling for the METSSS model’s predictions by using the multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.ResultsBetween the two models, only SORG-MLA achieved adequate discrimination (an AUROC of > 0.7) in the entire cohort (of patients treated operatively or with radiation alone) and in the subgroup of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy alone. SORG-MLA outperformed METSSS by a wide margin on discrimination, calibration, and Brier score analyses in not only the entire cohort but also the subgroup of patients whose local treatment consisted of radiotherapy alone. In both the entire cohort and the subgroup, DCA demonstrated that SORG-MLA provided more net benefit compared with the two default strategies (of treating all or no patients) and compared with METSSS when risk thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 at both 90 days and 1 year, indicating that using SORG-MLA as a decision-making aid was beneficial when a patient’s individualized risk threshold for opting for treatment was 0.2 to 0.9. Higher albumin, lower alkaline phosphatase, lower calcium, higher hemoglobin, lower international normalized ratio, higher lymphocytes, lower neutrophils, lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, higher sodium, and lower white blood cells were independently associated with better 1-year and overall survival after adjusting for the predictions made by METSSS.ConclusionBased on these discoveries, clinicians might choose to consult SORG-MLA instead of METSSS for survival estimation in patients with long-bone metastases presenting for evaluation of local treatment. Basing a treatment decision on the predictions of SORG-MLA could be beneficial when a patient’s individualized risk threshold for opting to undergo a particular treatment strategy ranged from 0.2 to 0.9. Future studies might investigate relevant laboratory items when constructing or refining a survival estimation model because these data demonstrated prognostic value independent of the predictions of the METSSS model, and future studies might also seek to keep these models up to date using data from diverse, contemporary patients undergoing both modern operative and nonoperative treatments.Level of EvidenceLevel III, diagnostic study.",0
"AbstractBackgroundThis study validates MRI-based tumor habitats in predicting time-to-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and progression sites in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma patients.MethodsSeventy-nine patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2020 and June 2022. MRI, including diffusion-weighted and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, were obtained immediately postoperation and at three serial timepoints. Voxels from cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were grouped into three habitats (hypervascular cellular, hypovascular cellular, and nonviable tissue) using k-means clustering. Predefined cutoffs for increases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitat were applied to calculate the habitat risk score. Associations between spatiotemporal habitats, habitat risk score, TTP, and OS were investigated using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Habitat risk score was compared to tumor volume using time-dependent receiver operating characteristics analysis. Progression sites were matched with spatial habitats.ResultsIncreases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitats and habitat risk scores were associated with shorter TTP and OS (all P < .05). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk scores 1 and 2 independently predicted TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 4.14; P = .03, HR, 4.51; P = .001 and HR, 10.02; P < .001, respectively). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk score 2 independently predicted OS (HR, 4.01, P = .003; and HR, 3.27, P < .001, respectively). Habitat risk score outperformed tumor volume in predicting TTP (12-month AUC, 0.762 vs. 0.646, P = .048). Hypovascular cellular habitat predicted progression sites (mean Dice index: 0.31).ConclusionsMultiparametric physiologic MRI-based spatiotemporal tumor habitats and habitat risk scores are useful biomarkers for early tumor progression and outcomes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients.","AbstractRecent interest has been in using mIDH inhibitors in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas.

"BackgroundBrain metastases (BMs) are the most common intracranial tumors among adults, which exceed primary brain tumors by far. Surgery and radiotherapy represent the key local management of BM. However, the exact role of surgery is still under debate.ObjectiveTo comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical management in patients with brain metastases.MethodsWe searched four electronic databases from January 2023 until September 2024 (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library). All the studies assessing the role of surgery in managing BM were included. Our primary search targets were survival, mortality, and postoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). The results were reported as pooled mean or proportions with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous and dichotomous data, respectively.ResultsEight observational studies comprising 1010 patients met our inclusion criteria. The pooled mean of overall survival was 10.482 with 95% CI [7.651, 13.314]. While the pooled proportion of one-year and two-year survival was (0.451, 95% CI [0.320, 0.582]) and (0.240, 95% CI [0.112, 0.367]), respectively. We found the pooled proportion of overall mortality to be 0.535 with 95% CI [0.278, 0.793]. Patients with immediate postoperative KPS improvement showed a pooled estimate of 0.463 with 95% CI [0.243, 0.683].ConclusionSurgical resection is an effective therapeutic option for patients with BMs. Yet, careful patient selection and surgical technique are crucial for reducing postoperative complications and death.","BackgroundColon cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers of the digestive tract. There is mounting evidence that genes associated with oxidative stress might affect the tumour immune microenvironment during tumour growth, maintenance, and treatment response. However, how oxidative stress-related genes affect prognostic importance, tumour microenvironment features, and treatment outcomes in colon cancer patients has not been fully elucidated.MethodsThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used to construct a signature model and nomogram using step and Cox regression approaches to investigate how gene expression affected immunological responses to colon cancer, including the degree of immune infiltration, MSI, and drug sensitivity.Results and conclusionsThe nomogram and the signature model had strong prognostic potential for colon cancer, with gene expression highly correlated with multiple immune cells. The first signature model and nomogram including oxidative stress-related genes were constructed for use in clinical decision-making. In addition, SRD5A1, GSR, TXN, TRAF2 and TRAP1 were identified as potential biomarkers for colon cancer diagnosis and indicators for immunotherapy.",0
"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a key cytokine regulating the development, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and death of T cells. In CD4+ T cells, TGF-β maintains the quiescence and controls the activation of naive T cells. While inhibiting the differentiation and function of Th1 and Th2 cells, TGF-β promotes the differentiation of Th17 and Th9 cells. TGF-β is required for the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells and the development of regulatory T cells. TGF-β is crucial in the differentiation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells and their retention in the tissue, whereas it suppresses effector T cell function. In addition, TGF-β also regulates the generation or function of natural killer T cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes. Here I highlight the major findings and recent advances in our understanding of TGF-β regulation of T cells and provide a personal perspective of the field.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy is making rapid strides owing to its wide range of therapeutic applications. However, development of serious immune responses to the capsid antigen or the therapeutic transgene product hinders its full clinical impact. Immune suppressive (IS) drug treatments have been used in various clinical trials to prevent the deleterious effects of cytotoxic T cells to the viral vector or transgene, although there is no consensus on the best treatment regimen, dosage, or schedule. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial for maintaining tolerance against self or nonself antigens. Of importance, Tregs also play an important role in dampening immune responses to AAV gene therapy, including tolerance induction to the transgene product. Approaches to harness the tolerogenic effect of Tregs include the use of selective IS drugs that expand existing Tregs, and skew activated conventional T cells into antigen-specific peripherally induced Tregs. In addition, Tregs can be expanded ex vivo and delivered as cellular therapy. Furthermore, receptor engineering can be used to increase the potency and specificity of Tregs allowing for suppression at lower doses and reducing the risk of disrupting protective immunity. Because immune-mediated toxicities to AAV vectors are a concern in the clinic, strategies that can enhance or preserve Treg function should be considered to improve both the safety and efficacy of AAV gene therapy.",1
"PurposeWe aimed to establish the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) in the East Asian population.MethodsOverall survival (OS) and intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to determine prognostic factors associated with intracranial PFS and OS.ResultsBetween July 2007 and December 2019, 431 patients diagnosed with MBM were enrolled. Mucosal subtype (p = 0.013), LDH level (p = 0.014), the number of MBM ≥ 4 (p = 0.02), local treatment (p < 0.0001) and the use of PD-1 inhibitors (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for intracranial PFS. Mucosal subtype (p = 0.022), LDH level (p = 0.005), no extracranial metastasis (p = 0.01), concurrent liver metastasis (p = 0.004), local treatment (p = 0.001) and the use of PD-1 inhibitors (p < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for OS. Mucosal subtype brain metastases had a poor response to PD-1 inhibitors (p = 0.007), with a shorter intracranial PFS than other subtypes. In BRAF mutation patients with MBM, the first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy group had an advantage in OS compared to the first-line anti-PD-1 therapy group (p = 0.043).ConclusionOur findings depict clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of MBM in the East Asian population, suggesting the mucosal subtype as an adverse prognostic and predictive factor for patients with MBM. For BRAF mutation patients with MBM, first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy may bring a potential survival benefit compared to first-line anti-PD-1 therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03563-0.","PurposeThe low objective response of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a great challenge in advanced melanoma therapy. Interferon-alpha has been proven to be a promising combination regimen with ICI in a phase Ib/II trial. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of interferon-alpha 1b plus PD-1 monoantibody in a real-world Chinese metastatic melanoma cohort.MethodsProfiles of patients diagnosed with unresectable stage IV (AJCC 8th Edition) between December 1st, 2018 and February 28th, 2022 from the Department of Dermatology, Xijing Hospital were reviewed. All of them received the combination treatment of interferon-alpha 1b (600 μg every other day) plus PD-1 monoantibody (Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or Toripalimab 240 mg or Sintilimab 200 mg, every 3 weeks) for at least 12 weeks. The efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V1.1). The safety data were identified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) V.5.0.ResultsIn total, 70 patients were included. 50% were females. 52.9% were with ECOG performance status ≥ 1. The fraction of patients receiving Pembrolizumab, Toripalimab, and Sintilimab was 28.6%, 67.1%, and 4.3%, respectively. Acral and mucosal subtypes accounted for 48.6% and 20%. The median follow-up period is 15.1 months. The objective response rate was 32.8%. The median time of overall survival was 18 months (95% CI 14.2–21.8 months), and the median time of PFS was 5.2 months (95% CI 4.2–6.2 months). The incidence of adverse events (any grade) was 98.6%, but only 8.6% of cases experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions.ConclusionThe combination of interferon-alpha 1b and PD-1 monoantibody demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects and acceptable toxicity in Chinese metastatic melanoma patients with cutaneous, acral, and mucosal subtypes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04596-3.",1
"AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.","AbstractRationaleHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.Eligibility criteriaParallel‐group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross‐over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi‐randomised trials for analysis.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non‐serious.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta‐analysed the outcome data at the longest follow‐up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random‐effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.Included studiesWe included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single‐centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia‐Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co‐interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information.The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow‐up was three months to five years.Synthesis of resultsTen trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions.Eight trials evaluated all‐cause mortality at varied follow‐up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow‐up periods taken together.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one‐year follow‐up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events.One trial measured health‐related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow‐up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health‐related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health‐related quality of life scores. No further data were provided.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non‐serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non‐serious.We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.We identified no ongoing trials.Authors' conclusionsBased on the low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all‐cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events considered non‐serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationProtocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014869.",1
"AbstractHematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a serine-threonine kinase specific to hematopoiesis and a member of the MAP4K family of Ste20-related protein kinases. Targeting HPK1 to ameliorate T cell exhaustion and enhance T cell functions is a promising strategy for clinical immunotherapies. Numerous studies have reported the progress in developing effective HPK1 inhibitors and elucidating their mechanisms of action. However, most inhibitors affect multiple signaling pathways, resulting in unintended side effects that limit their clinical development and application. Herein, we reviewed HPK1-related signaling pathways, clinical candidates and recent advances in small-molecule inhibitors targeting HPK1. Additionally, we present our perspectives on current challenges and potential future research field, hoping to provide inspiration for the development of novel HPK1 inhibitors.","BackgroundPatients with glioma have limited treatment options and experience poor prognoses. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the relevance of WSC domain-containing 2 (WSCD2) expression to glioma, clinicopathological characteristics, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TILs), and patient prognosis.MethodsWe analyzed WSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues and patient survival using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. Furthermore, the relationship between the expressions of WSCD2 mRNA and TILs in gliomas was evaluated utilizing the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Lastly, we employed multiplex immunohistochemistry to detect the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues.ResultsWSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues was lower than that in tissues of benign brain disease. High WSCD2 mRNA expression was also significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, WSCD2 mRNA expression was correlated with TIL expression in glioma; however, no such relationship was detected between the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues. Cox regression multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that WSCD2 expression in glioma tissues could be an independent prognostic factor.ConclusionThis study highlights the correlation between WSCD2 expression and TILs and demonstrates the prognostic significance of WSCD2 in glioma. Furthermore, our results suggest that WSCD2 may be a potential immunotherapy target in glioma.",1

IDH1 R132H is the most common mutation of IDH1, which affects codon 132 and results in the conversion of amino acid residue arginine (R) to histidine (H). This study is designed to evaluate the association between the expression of IDH1 R132H and clinicopathological characteristics in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).MethodsThe expression pattern and clinical significance of IDH1 R132H were investigated in tissue microarrays (TMAs) of 50 LSCC tumors as well as adjacent normal tissues using immunohistochemistry. Then the exons of the 12 tumor samples with negative/weak positive staining were sequenced by applying polymerase chain reaction (PCR).ResultsThe results demonstrated that the cytoplasmic expression of IDH1 R132H was downregulated in tumor cells compared to adjacent normal tissues. A statistically significant association was found between a low level of cytoplasmic expression of IDH1 R132H protein and an increase in histological grade (p < 0.001), perineural invasion (p = 0.019), and lymph node involvement (p < 0.001). The exon4 sequencing results showed that only one sample was positive for IDH1 R132H mutation. IDH1 R132H expression was observed in 39 (78.0%) LSCC samples.ConclusionThese findings indicate that low cytoplasmic expression of IDH1 R132H may have clinical significance in LSCC patients and is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior and progression of the disease, which can help improve potential treatment in patients with LSCC. Further investigations are needed to understand the biological function of IDH1 R132H and larger sample size to confirm our findings.",0
"PurposeNRAS plays a pivotal role in progression of various kinds of somatic malignancies; however, the correlation between NRAS and lung adenocarcinoma is less known. We aim to analyze the prognostic value of NRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma, and explore the relationship between NRAS and tumor immune microenvironment.MethodsWe obtained the transcriptome profiles and clinical data of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and three Genome Expression Omnibus datasets. Specimens from 325 patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma were collected for immunohistochemical assays of NRAS, PD-L1, PD-1 and TIM-3. Then, we performed gene set enrichment analysis to investigate cancer-related and immune-related signaling pathways. TIMER algorithms were performed to evaluate tumor immune infiltrating cells and immune-related biomarkers.ResultsCompared with adjacent non-tumor tissue, NRAS expression was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissue. NRAS expression was significantly correlated with more advanced stage and positive lymph nodes. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox analysis suggested that high NRAS expression led to a poor prognosis, and could be an independent prognostic factor in LUAD patients. Besides, NRAS expression was positively correlated with CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, and negatively correlated with B cells and CD4+ T cells. The expression level of NRAS was positively correlated with PD-L1, PD-1, and TIM-3 both at RNA and protein level.ConclusionsTo conclude, we found NRAS is a novel prognostic biomarker in LUAD. Besides, the expression level of NRAS may influence the prognosis of LUAD via various kinds of cancer-related pathways and remodeling TIM.","SummaryThe mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) family of chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in regulating DNA accessibility and gene expression. The three final-form subcomplexes – cBAF, PBAF, and ncBAF— are distinct in biochemical componentry, chromatin targeting, and roles in disease, however the contributions of their constituent subunits to gene expression remain incompletely defined. Here, we performed Perturb-seq-based CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens targeting mSWI/SNF subunits individually and in select combinations, followed by single-cell RNA-seq and SHARE-Seq. We uncovered complex-, module-, and subunit-specific contributions to distinct regulatory networks, and defined paralog subunit relationships and shifted subcomplex functions upon perturbations. Synergistic, intra-complex genetic interactions between subunits reveal functional redundancy and modularity. Importantly, single-cell subunit perturbation signatures mapped across bulk primary human tumor expression profiles both mirror and predict cBAF loss-of-function status in cancer. Our findings highlight the utility of Perturb-Seq to dissect disease-relevant gene regulatory impacts of heterogeneous, multi-component master regulatory complexes.",0
"Despite the notable efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, resistance in most individuals necessitates additional investigation. For this study, we collected tumor tissues from nine HCC patients receiving anti-PD1 monotherapy and conducted RNA sequencing. These findings revealed significant upregulation of GSDME, which is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in anti-PD1-resistant patients. Furthermore, patients with elevated levels of GSDME+ macrophages in HCC tissues presented a poorer prognosis. The analysis of single-cell sequencing data and flow cytometry revealed that the suppression of GSDME expression in nontumor cells resulted in a decrease in the proportion of M2-like macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TIME) of HCC while concurrently augmenting the cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells. The non-N-terminal fragment of GSDME within macrophages combines with PDPK1, thereby activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and facilitating M2-like polarization. The small-molecule Eliprodil inhibited the increase in PDPK1 phosphorylation mediated by GSDME site 1. The combination of Eliprodil and anti-PD1 was effective in the treatment of both spontaneous HCC in c-Myc + /+;Alb-Cre + /+ mice and in a hydrodynamic tail vein injection model, which provides a promising strategy for novel combined immunotherapy.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor with significant global health implications. The role of CD4+ T cells, particularly conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), in HCC progression remains unexplored. Furthermore, epigenetic factors are crucial in immune regulation, yet their specific role in HCC-infiltrating Tconv cells remains elusive. This study elucidates the role of MATR3, an epigenetic regulator, in modulating Tconv activity and immune evasion within the HCC microenvironment. Reanalysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed that early activation of CD4+ T cells is crucial for establishing an antitumor immune response. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that Tconv enhances cDC1-induced CD8+ T-cell activation. Screening identified MATR3 as a critical regulator of Tconv function, which is necessary for antitumour activity but harmful when overexpressed. Excessive MATR3 expression exacerbates Tconv exhaustion and impairs function by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to relax chromatin in the TOX promoter region, leading to aberrant transcriptional changes. In summary, MATR3 is an HCC-specific epigenetic checkpoint that bidirectionally regulates Tconv antitumour immunity, suggesting new therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic regulators to enhance antitumour immunity in HCC.",1
"Purpose The efficacy and lower neurotoxicity of normal brain-sparing radiotherapy (NBS-RT) with systemic therapy in treating multiple brain metastases from non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is underexplored. This study compares whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and NBS-RT for multiple brain metastases in NSCLC, focusing on treatment outcomes and leukoencephalopathy.Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 503 patients with NSCLC with multiple brain metastases at a single center, treated with either WBRT or NBS-RT. Post-RT treatments included chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Main outcomes measured were intracranial control, overall survival (OS), and leukoencephalopathy incidence.Results In this study, 441 patients received WBRT and 62 received NBS-RT, with median ages of 62 and 61 years, respectively. A significant portion of both groups, 77.3% in WBRT and 80.6% in NBS-RT, received post-RT systemic therapy. The median number of brain metastases was 10 for WBRT and 12 for NBS-RT, with median maximal diameters of 11.7 mm in WBRT and 14.4 mm in NBS-RT. After a median follow-up of 10.9 months for WBRT and 11.8 months for NBS-RT, there were no significant differences in intracranial progression (p=0.516) or OS (p=0.492) between the groups. However, WBRT patients had a higher incidence of leukoencephalopathy than NBS-RT patients (p=0.013).Conclusion NBS-RT combined with systemic therapy was as effective in treating multiple brain metastases as WBRT and was less toxic. NBS-RT-based strategies deserve further investigation in a prospective setting.","AbstractBackgroundSuper-enhancers (SEs) typically govern the expression of critical oncogenes and play a fundamental role in the initiation and progression of cancer. Focusing on genes that are abnormally regulated by SE in cancer may be a new strategy for understanding pathogenesis. In the context of this investigation, we have identified a previously unreported SE-driven gene IRF2BP2 in neuroblastoma (NB).MethodsThe expression and prognostic value of IRF2BP2 were detected in public databases and clinical samples. The effect of IRF2BP2 on NB cell growth and apoptosis was evaluated through in vivo and in vitro functional loss experiments. The molecular mechanism of IRF2BP2 was investigated by the study of chromatin regulatory regions and transcriptome sequencing.ResultsThe sustained high expression of IRF2BP2 results from the activation of a novel SE established by NB master transcription factors MYCN, MEIS2, and HAND2, and they form a new complex that regulates the gene network associated with the proliferation of NB cell populations. We also observed a significant enrichment of the AP-1 family at the binding sites of IRF2BP2. Remarkably, within NB cells, AP-1 plays a pivotal role in shaping the chromatin accessibility landscape, thereby exposing the binding site for IRF2BP2. This orchestrated action enables AP-1 and IRF2BP2 to collaboratively stimulate the expression of the NB susceptibility gene ALK, thereby upholding the highly proliferative phenotype characteristic of NB.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that SE-driven IRF2BP2 can bind to AP-1 to maintain the survival of tumor cells via regulating chromatin accessibility of the NB susceptibility gene ALK.",0
"SummaryHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, debilitating inflammatory skin disease characterized by keratinized epithelial tunnels that grow deeply into the dermis. Here we examined the immune microenvironment within human HS lesions. Multi-omics profiling and multiplexed imaging identified tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) near HS tunnels. These TLSs were enriched with proliferative T cells, including follicular helper (Tfh), regulatory (Treg), and pathogenic T cells (IL17A+ and IFNG+), alongside extensive clonal expansion of plasma cells producing antibodies reactive to keratinocytes. HS fibroblasts express CXCL13 or CCL19 in response to immune cytokines. Using a microfluidic system to mimic TLS-on-a-chip, we found that HS fibroblasts critically orchestrated lymphocyte aggregation via TNFα-CXCL13 and TNFα-CCL19 feedback loops with B and T cells, respectively; early TNFα blockade suppressed aggregate initiation. Our findings provide insights into TLS formation in the skin, suggest therapeutic avenues for HS and reveal mechanisms that may apply to other autoimmune settings, including Crohn’s Disease.","BACKGROUND:Patients with brain metastases (BrMs) from esophageal cancer have poor prognosis, the incidence of which is expected to rise due to improved survival from the primary tumor and increased neuroimaging. We aimed to identify patient and esophageal cancer characteristics associated with longer survival in patients with BrMs and, secondly, to compare the prognosis of patients with HER2 overexpression.METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed patients with BrMs from esophageal cancer at a single institution from 2008–2021. We collected patient demographics, primary tumor and BrM characteristics, and treatment. Our primary outcome was median survival from the time of BrM.RESULTS:The median age at primary diagnosis was 66.5 years and 86% were male. Of the 49 patients, 71% had adenocarcinoma, 20% squamous cell carcinoma and 8% other. In this group, 71% of patients presented with stage III or IV disease, including 16% with synchronous primary metastatis and BrM. The median time to BrM was 10.1 months (interquartile range 1.7–22.8) and the median survival from BrM was 8.4 months (95% CI 4.8–16.8 months). On multivariable analysis, treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.19; P = 0.04), surgical resection (HR 0.24; P = 0.03), and immunotherapy (HR 0.19; P = 0.04) were associated with increased survival while Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≤70 (HR = 13.2; P < 0.001) was associated with decreased survival. HER2 overexpression was found in 22% of patients, but we noted no survival difference (5.2 months HER2+ vs. 9.8 months HER2neg; P = 0.95).CONCLUSIONS:The median survival from esophageal-to-brain metastasis was 8.4 months. Patients with a single lesion, KPS score >70, and treatment with surgical resection was correlated with improved survival. Further, HER2+ patients had distinct patient and BrM characteristics.",0
"Background and aimFKBP1A, a gene encoding the FK506-binding protein 1A, has emerged as a significant player in cancer progression and prognosis. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer, focusing on its differential expression patterns, prognostic implications, genetic alterations, and associations with the tumor microenvironment.Methods and resultsUsing large-scale datasets, including GTEx, TCGA, HPA, and cBioPortal, we analyzed FKBP1A expression across normal tissues and various cancer types. Our findings revealed that FKBP1A exhibited aberrant upregulation in most human cancers, making it a potential biomarker for malignancy. Moreover, FKBP1A expression correlated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, disease-free interval, and progression-free interval in several cancers, indicating its prognostic significance. Genetic alteration analysis showed that FKBP1A gene amplification was prevalent, particularly in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, FKBP1A expression was associated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, highlighting its potential involvement in tumor-immune response. Notably, FKBP1A expression positively correlated with stromal and immune cell scores, suggesting its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, according to the functional enrichment analysis, experimental validation in lung adenocarcinoma confirmed the role of FKBP1A through the regulation of EGFR signaling by apoptosis, which is consistent with drug sensitivity analysis to some extent.ConclusionIn conclusion, FKBP1A exhibits differential expression in cancer, serves as a prognostic indicator, undergoes genetic alterations, and influences the tumor-immune microenvironment. These findings shed light on the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer development and progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and guidance of clinical drugs selection, and provide valuable insights into patient prognosis for interventions based on pharmaceuticals.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05362-1.","AbstractGlioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive high-grade glioma that is fatal despite standard-of-care therapy. Recurrent somatic alterations that form neoantigens represent opportunities for targeted therapeutic intervention. Using human EGFRvIII as a prototypical structural alteration and neoantigen, we tested the potential of a mRNA-LNP vaccine approach to improve the survival of mice with EGFRvIII-driven GBM. To generate the model, we used in vivo electroporation to introduce genetic alterations (EGFRvIII-OE/CDKN2A-KO/PTEN-KO) into periventricular cells of early postnatal C3H mice, then propagated cells from the subsequent tumours to create implantable cell lines. Following orthotopic implantation, the resulting syngeneic tumours faithfully recapitulate histologic features of GBM with infiltrative growth, mitoses, necrosis, and vascular proliferation. Also like human GBM, the models are sensitive to but not cured by temozolomide chemotherapy and are resistant to immune checkpoint blockade. We delivered mRNA-LNP vaccines against EGFRvIII into the thigh muscle of tumour-bearing mice on days 7, 10, 14, 21, and 36 after tumour cell implant. We observed no tumour in vaccine-treated mice compared to significant tumour burden in control vector-treated animals by MR imaging at day 30 post-tumour cell implant. By day 37, all control-treated mice had died, whereas vaccine-treated mice cleared their tumours with no tumour burden detectable by histology at day 150 (N= 5 per group, **p= 0.0023). In a follow-up experiment with vaccine or control treatment on days 10, 14, 18, and 25 post-cell implants, all control mice had died by day 39. Further, vaccine-treated surviving animals were re-challenged with tumour cell implant into the contralateral hemisphere on day 42 and remain alive as of day 90. Our ongoing proof-of-principle work demonstrates that neoantigen driver mutations in high-grade glioma models can be targeted with an mRNA lipid vaccine. We hope this pre-clinical work will lead to early-phase clinical trials.",0
"BackgroundTo date, no comprehensive analysis of gallbladder cancer (GBC) management has been reported. We aimed to identify the publication characteristics and research trends in managing GBC over the past three decades.MethodsWe selected the 100 most cited articles and performed a bibliometric analysis to summarize the publication characteristics, explore research hotspots, and identify research trends in the management of GBC.ResultsThe total citations of the included articles ranged from 123 to 1822. Period II (2001–2010) yielded the highest number of included articles, whereas the lowest was in Period III (2011–2020). The United States and Japan published the most papers, in which the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center and Nagoya University were the leading institutions, respectively. The most influential authors were Blumgart LH and Fong YM from the United States. Cooperation among countries, institutions, and authors was weak. The Annals of Surgery contributed the most articles with the highest number of total citations. The most researched topic was surgery, followed by systemic therapy and adjuvant therapy. Since Period I, the percentage of surgery-related publications continuously decreased (Periods II and III versus Period I, both p < 0.001), with a concomitant increase in those of adjuvant therapy (Period III versus Period I, p = 0.004) and systemic therapy (Period II versus Period I, p = 0.004; Period III versus Period I, p = 0.002).ConclusionsSurgery remains the preferred treatment, while there is a tendency toward adjuvant and systemic therapy in GBC management. An increase in local and international collaboration for managing GBC is required.","PurposeWe aimed to investigate whether induction chemotherapy with less than four courses is as effective as induction chemotherapy with more than four courses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy.MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 249 patients with NSCLC who received chemoimmunotherapy at 12 centers in Japan between January and December 2019. The patient group that completed less than four courses owing to adverse events (AEs), and received subsequent maintenance therapy was compared to the group that received at least four courses of induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsOn univariate and multivariate analyses, the patient group that transitioned to maintenance therapy after completing less than four courses of induction chemotherapy had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those who completed at least four courses (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.38–3.37, p < 0.001 and HR 2.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.40–3.84, p = 0.001, respectively). There was no obvious difference in PFS between the group in which induction chemotherapy ended in two or three courses leading to partial or complete response, and the group that continued at least four courses of induction chemotherapy (log-rank test p = 0.53).ConclusionTreatment efficacy may be maintained if induction chemotherapy is completed in less than four courses owing to development of AEs, and is administered for more than two courses with partial or complete response; efficacy is maintained even on transitioning to maintenance therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03782-5.",0
"Lung cancer continues to be the third leading cause of cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths. As the field of interventional oncology continues to grow, interventional radiologists are increasingly treating lung cancer patients. Involvement begins with tissue diagnosis for which biomarkers and immunohistochemistry are used to guide selective and advanced medical therapies. An interventional radiologist must be aware of the rationale behind tissue diagnosis and techniques to minimize biopsy complications. Staging is an important part of tumor board conversations and drives treatment pathways. Surgical therapy remains the gold standard for early-stage disease but with an aging population the need for less invasive treatments such as radiation therapy and ablation continue to grow. The interventionalist must be aware of the indications, techniques, and pre- and posttherapy managements for percutaneous ablation. Endovascular therapy is broadly divided into therapeutic treatment of lung cancer, which is gaining traction, and treatment of lung cancer complications such as hemoptysis. This review aims to provide a good basis for interventional radiologists treating lung cancer patients.","Gene dysregulations are associated with many human diseases, such as cancers and hereditary diseases. Artificial transcription factors (ATFs) are synthetic molecular tools to regulate the expression of disease-associated genes, which is of great significance in basic biological research and biomedical applications. Recent advances in the engineering of ATFs for regulating endogenous gene expression provide an expanded set of tools for understanding and treating diseases. However, the potential immunogenicity, large size, inefficient delivery, and off-target effects persist as obstacles for ATFs to be developed into therapeutics. Moreover, the activation of an endogenous gene following ATF activity lacks durability. In this review, we first describe the functional components of ATFs, including DNA-binding domains, transcriptional effector domains, and control switches. We then highlight examples of applications of ATFs, including cell reprogramming and differentiation, pathogenic gene screening, and disease treatment. Finally, we analyze and summarize major challenges for the clinical translation of ATFs and propose potential strategies to improve these useful molecular tools.",0
"PurposeProstate cancer can undergo curative effects by radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy. However, the best treatment for more aggressive high-risk prostate cancer remains controversial. Insufficient infiltration capacity and dysfunction are commonly occurrences in engineered T lymphocytes expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T), characterizing cancer immunotherapy failure. We conducted this study to investigate whether the combinative application of docetaxel and PSMA-CAR-T cells could be a more effective treatment to prostate cancer.MethodsExpressions of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate cancer cells were examined by Flow cytometry. The efficaciousness of PSMA-CAR-T was evaluated in vitro using ELISA and RTCA. The effect of intermixed therapy was assessed in vivo utilizing a human prostate cancer liver metastasis mouse model and a human prostate cancer cell xenograft mouse model.ResultsThe outcome of cytokine discharge and cell killing assays demonstrated that PSMA-CAR-T cells have characteristic effector capacity against PSMA+ prostate cancer cells in vitro. Additionally, collaborative treatment of PSMA-CAR-T cells and docetaxel have cooperative efficacy in a mouse model of human prostate cancer. The merged strategy could be seen as an undeveloped avenue to augmenting adoptive CAR-T cell immunotherapy and mitigating the adverse side effects of chemotherapy.ConclusionsCooperation of PSMA-specific CAR-T cells and the chemotherapy drug docetaxel can impressively ameliorate antitumor effectiveness against an installed metastatic human prostate cancer model in NPG mice.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04248-y.","BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promising results in treating blood cancers, but it has limited efficacy against solid tumors that express mesothelin (MSLN). One of the reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which consists of physical barriers, multiple mechanisms of immune evasion, and various biochemical factors that favor tumor growth and survival. These factors reduce the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells in clinical trials. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to enhance the effectiveness of MSLN-targeted CAR T cell therapy.MethodsTo investigate whether the antitumor efficacy of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells depends on the epitopes they recognize, we generated MSLN-targeted CAR T cells that bind to different regions of MSLN (Region I, II, III and Full length). We then evaluated the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan or an anti-PD-1 antibody in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe found that MSLN-targeted CAR T cells effectively killed MSLN-positive cancer cells (H9, H226 and Panc-1), but not MSLN-negative cells (A431) in vitro. In a mouse model of H9 tumor xenografts, all CAR T cells showed similar tumor suppression, but an MSLN-targeted scFv with Region I epitope, R47, performed slightly better. Combining irinotecan with CAR_R47 T cells enhanced tumor control synergistically in both H9 xenograft mice and patient-derived xenograft mice.ConclusionsOur results suggest that irinotecan can enhance the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells, and offer a promising combination therapy strategy for MSLN-positive solid tumors.",1
"BackgroundTumor endothelial cells (TECs) play a significant role in regulating the tumor microenvironment, drug response, and immune cell activities in various cancers. However, the association between TEC gene expression signature and patient prognosis or therapeutic response remains poorly understood.MethodsWe analyzed transcriptomics data of normal and tumor endothelial cells obtained from the GEO database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with TECs. We then compared these DEGs with those commonly found across five different tumor types from the TCGA database to determine their prognostic relevance. Using these genes, we constructed a prognostic risk model integrated with clinical features to develop a nomogram model, which we validated through biological experiments.ResultsWe identified 12 TEC-related prognostic genes across multiple tumor types, of which five genes were sufficient to construct a prognostic risk model with an AUC of 0.682. The risk scores effectively predicted patient prognosis and immunotherapeutic response. Our newly developed nomogram model provided more accurate prognostic estimates of cancer patients than the TNM staging method (AUC = 0.735) and was validated using external patient cohorts. Finally, RT–PCR and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the expression of these 5 TEC-related prognostic genes was up-regulated in both patient-derived tumors and cancer cell lines, while depletion of the hub genes reduced cancer cell growth, migration and invasion, and enhanced their sensitivity to gemcitabine or cytarabine.ConclusionsOur study discovered the first TEC-related gene expression signature that can be used to construct a prognostic risk model for guiding treatment options in multiple cancers.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04848-2.","BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.",1
"Aim: Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized treatment of metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Our goal was to assess for an association between immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and clinical outcomes for patients on ICIs.Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 110 HNSCC patients who received ICI therapy at the University of Virginia.Results: On review, 48% of our patients experienced an irAE with the most common events being hypothyroidism (30%), dermatitis (14%) and hepatitis (11%). Women were more likely to experience irAEs. Treatment interruption/discontinuation occurred in 43% patients with irAEs. Development of irAEs was associated with superior objective response rate (68 vs. 39%, p = 0.009), with a greater rate of CR (17 vs. 5%) and PR (32 vs. 16%). Twelve patients underwent ICI re-treatment following irAE, with 17% attaining a complete disease response, 25% attaining a partial response, 33% achieving stable disease and 25% experiencing disease progression with ICI resumption.Conclusion: Development of irAE was associated with superior objective response rate, with a greater rate of CR and PR. ICI re-treatment following irAE was feasible in a significant proportion of patients and can be attempted in carefully selected patients, given the dearth of second-line therapies for these patients.","AbstractBackgroundThis investigator-initiated phase II trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (CaboNivoIpi) in previously treated patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.MethodsEligible patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who progressed on 1 prior line of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy received a 2-week run-in of cabozantinib monotherapy followed by CaboNivoIpi for 4 cycles (cycle length = 6 weeks), followed by cabozantinib plus nivolumab (cycle length = 4 weeks) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) within the first 6 months of treatment. A Simon optimal 2-stage design allowed for an interim analysis after accrual of 10 evaluable patients. At least 5 responses were needed to proceed to stage 2.ResultsAmong 11 patients enrolled, the median age was 69 years. Prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapies included lenvatinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib plus everolimus. Median follow-up was 13.4 months. Among 10 evaluable patients, ORR within the first 6 months of treatment was 10% (1 partial response). Median progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI, 3.0–not reached) and median overall survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 4.6–not reached). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were noted in 55% (6/11) and grade 5 AEs in 18% (2/11) of patients. The most common treatment-related AE was hypertension. The study did not reach its prespecified efficacy threshold.ConclusionCaboNivoIpi had low ORRs and a high rate of grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs.Clinical Trial RegistrationNCT03914300",1
"AbstractAdiponectin is an abundantly secreted hormone that communicates information between the adipose tissue, and the immune and cardiovascular systems. In metabolically healthy individuals, adiponectin is usually found at high levels and helps improve insulin responsiveness of peripheral tissues, glucose tolerance, and fatty acid oxidation. Beyond its metabolic functions in insulin-sensitive tissues, adiponectin plays a prominent role in attenuating the development of atherosclerotic plaques, partially through regulating macrophage-mediated responses. In this context, adiponectin binds to its receptors, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and AdipoR2 on the cell surface of macrophages to activate a downstream signaling cascade and induce specific atheroprotective functions. Notably, macrophages modulate the stability of the plaque through their ability to switch between proinflammatory responders, and anti-inflammatory proresolving mediators. Traditionally, the extremes of the macrophage polarization spectrum span from M1 proinflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Previous evidence has demonstrated that the adiponectin-AdipoR pathway influences M1-M2 macrophage polarization; adiponectin promotes a shift toward an M2-like state, whereas AdipoR1- and AdipoR2-specific contributions are more nuanced. To explore these concepts in depth, we discuss in this review the effect of adiponectin and AdipoR1/R2 on 1) metabolic and immune responses, and 2) M1-M2 macrophage polarization, including their ability to attenuate atherosclerotic plaque inflammation, and their potential as therapeutic targets for clinical applications.","AbstractAsthma exacerbation is a common clinical occurrence.

The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (MNP), an environmental pollutant, in asthma exacerbation. In this study, an airway allergy mouse model was established with ovalbumin as a specific antigen with or without the presence of MNP. The results showed that, in a mouse model, the intensity of airway allergy was significantly increased by exposure to MNP. RNAseq results showed an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated molecules and the Osm expression in airway epithelial cells of mice with airway allergy. Exposure of epithelial cells to MNP in culture induced the expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and ER stress associated molecules. The OSM receptor was expressed by macrophages. OSM could drive macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Inhibition of PERK, one of the key molecules of ER stress, or depletion of OSM receptor in macrophages, could effectively attenuate the MNP/ovalbumin protocol induced airway allergy. To sum up, by promoting ER stress, environmental pollutant MNP can cause airway epithelial cells to produce OSM. The latter induces macrophages to produce TNF-α, which can exacerbate airway allergy.",1
"IntroductionMetastasis remains the major cause of death in breast cancer (BrCa) and lacks specific treatment strategies. The kynurenine pathway (KP) has been suggested as a key mechanism facilitating progression of BrCa. While KP activity has been explored in primary BrCa, its role in metastasis remains unclear. To better understand this, we examined changes in the KP of BrCa with no metastasis compared to BCa that produced local or distant metastases. Given that the cancer cell secretome plays a role in metastasis, we also investigated the relationship between changes in KP activity and serum proteins of patients with local or distant metastases.MethodsTo investigate changes in the KP in BrCa, with and without metastasis, we quantified KP metabolites in blood sera collected from patients with stage 1 BrCa (n = 34), BrCa with local metastases (n = 46), BrCa with distant metastases (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 39). The serum protein profile of the BrCa patients with local or distant metastasis was determined before correlation analyses were carried out to examine the relationship between changes in the KP and cancer serum proteins using SPSS.ResultsWe found that the KP was elevated in BrCa patients with local and distant metastasis compared to healthy controls and stage 1 BrCa patients. The activity of kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) and kynureninase (KYNU) A was positively associated with disease stage and was higher compared to healthy controls. Proteome analysis in patients with local or distant metastasis revealed the dysregulation of 14 proteins, 9 of which were up-regulated and 5 down-regulated at the distant metastasis stage. Importantly, three of these proteins have not been previously linked to BrCa metastasis. In the correlation studies between the KP profile, cancer serum proteins and metastasis status, KYNU A had the greatest number of significant associations with cancer serum protein, followed by KMO.ConclusionOur findings reveal that the KP was regulated differently at various stages of BrCa and was more dysregulated in patients with local or distant metastasis. These KP activity changes showed a significant association with cancer serum proteins in BrCa patients with local or distant metastasis, highlighting the potential role of KP in BrCa metastasis.","Background and aimDanggui Buxue Decoction (DBD) has been applied to alleviate chronic heart failure (CHF) in clinics, however, its mechanism is still unclear. This study investigates the potential action mechanism of DBD for rats with CHF combined with liver injury.Experimental procedureFor this purpose, this study established a CHF rat model. The change of proteins in myocardial tissues was identified by proteomics and then further verified using western blotting. Additionally, metabolomics revealed the metabolic pathways associated with liver injury in CHF rats.Results and conclusionAnimal studies demonstrated that DBD could relieve CHF as it significantly reduced serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in CHF rats, and promoted the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), cytochrome oxidase (COX), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in myocardial tissues. Myocardial proteomics analysis revealed that DBD improved myocardial mitochondria and peroxisomes function by regulating the expression of proteins associated with energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Western blotting confirmed that DBD upregulated the expression of proteins in the adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 α)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPAR β) signaling pathway, which also proved the efficacy of DBD in alleviating CHF in rats. Hepatic metabolomics analysis showed that DBD could restore the damaged liver function of CHF rats via metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of lipid, vitamin, and amino acids. In conclusion, this study unveiled a novel action mechanism of DBD in the treating ISO-induced CHF and liver injury based on proteomics and metabolomics. These results lay a scientific basis for the widespread application of DBD in the cardiovascular field.",1
"In gynecological oncology, ovarian cancer (OC) remains the most lethal, highlighting its significance in public health. Our research focused on the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in OC, particularly senescence-related lncRNAs (SnRlncRNAs), crucial for OC prognosis. Utilizing data from the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) and cancer genome Atlas (TCGA), SnRlncRNAs were discerned and subsequently, a risk signature was sculpted using co-expression and differential expression analyses, Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). This signature's robustness was validated through time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and multivariate Cox regression, with further validation in the international cancer genome consortium (ICGC). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) unveiled pathways intertwined with risk groups. The ROC, alongside the nomogram and calibration outcomes, attested to the model's robust predictive accuracy. Of particular significance, our model has demonstrated superiority over several commonly utilized clinical indicators, such as stage and grade. Patients in the low-risk group demonstrated greater immune infiltration and varied drug sensitivities compared to other groups. Moreover, consensus clustering classified OC patients into four distinct groups based on the expression of 17 SnRlncRNAs, showing diverse survival rates. In conclusion, these findings underscored the robustness and reliability of our model and highlighted its potential for facilitating improved decision-making in the context of risk assessment, and demonstrated that these markers potentially served as robust, efficacious biomarkers and prognostic tools, offering insights into predicting OC response to anticancer therapeutics.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00163-z.","Asthma is a descriptive label for an obstructive inflammatory disease in the lower airways manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing. From a clinician’s point of view, asthma symptoms can commence at any age, although most patients with asthma—regardless of their age of onset—seem to have had some form of airway problems during childhood. Asthma inception and related pathophysiologic processes are therefore very likely to occur early in life, further evidenced by recent lung physiologic and mechanistic research. Herein, we present state-of-the-art updates on the role of genetics and epigenetics, early viral and bacterial infections, immune response, and pathophysiology, as well as lifestyle and environmental exposures, in asthma across the life course. We conclude that early environmental insults in genetically vulnerable individuals inducing abnormal, pre-asthmatic airway responses are key events in asthma inception, and we highlight disease heterogeneity across ages and the potential shortsightedness of treating all patients with asthma using the same treatments. Although there are no interventions that, at present, can modify long-term outcomes, a precision-medicine approach should be implemented to optimize treatment and tailor follow-up for all patients with asthma.",0
"PurposesIncreased number of studies reveal the crucial role of the Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway in anti-tumor immunity. In this study, we aim to explore the effect of cGAS/STING on tumor immune microenvironment of melanoma after carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and the underlying mechanism.MethodsC57BL/6 mouse tumor models were used to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments (X-ray, carbon ion, PD-L1 inhibitor and combination therapies) on tumor growth and process. Mass cytometry was performed to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). DNA damage response (DDR) and cGAS/STING pathway were investigated by immunofluorescence-co-localization assays, γ-H2AX, P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), Breast Cancer 1 (BRCA1), and cGAS measurements.ResultsCarbon ion irradiation caused more DNA damages and cGAS–STING pathway activation compared with X-ray irradiation, and the former slowed the melanoma growth in syngeneic model. Although X-ray irradiation is not sensitive for melanoma treatment, carbon ion irradiation showed a significant anti-tumor effect for melanoma treatment. TILs analysis revealed that CIRT boosted the infiltration of natural killer (NK), CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, meanwhile increased the number of immune checkpoint (programmed death-1, PD-1, lymphocyte activation gene 3, LAG-3 and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3, TIM-3). Moreover, CIRT increased PD-L1 exposure on cell surface compared with X-ray group. Furthermore, CIRT combined with PD-L1 inhibitor therapy increased the number of T cells and NK cells in melanoma, and slowed the growth of melanoma compared with other therapies.ConclusionsOur findings showed that CIRT displayed biological effects by increasing DNA damages of tumor cells and improving immunity in melanoma, which indicated that CIRT might be a potential synergetic treatment for radiotherapy and radioimmunotherapy in melanoma patients. Our works put forward a new insight to provide an effective strategy for melanoma therapy. These findings may help in the design of strategies on melanoma in clinical studies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04577-6.","Background and Aims:Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) worsens the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma by increasing intrahepatic dissemination and inducing portal vein hypertension. However, the immune characteristics of PVTT remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to explore the immune microenvironment in PVTT.Approach and Results:Time-of-flight mass cytometry revealed that macrophages and monocytes were the dominant immune cell type in PVTT, with a higher proportion than in primary tumor and blood (54.1% vs. 26.3% and 9.1%, p<0.05). The differentially enriched clustering of inhibitory and regulatory immune cells in PVTT indicated an immune-suppressive environment. According to the single-cell RNA sequencing, TAM-C5AR1 was characterized by leukocyte chemotaxis and was the most common subpopulation in PVTT (36.7%). Multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry staining showed that the C5aR+ TAM/Mφ were enriched in PVTT compared to both the primary tumor and liver and positively correlated with C5a (r=0.559, p<0.001). Notably, THP-1 (monocyte cell line) was recruited by CSQT2 (PVTT cell line) and exhibited up-regulation of CD163, CD206, and PD-L1 upon stimulation. C5aR antagonist could reverse this. C5aR+ TAMs could also inhibit Granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. High infiltration of C5aR+ TAMs in PVTT correlated with poor differentiation (p<0.009) and was a risk factor for overall survival (p=0.003) and for reformation of PVTT after resection (p=0.007).Conclusions:TAMs, especially C5aR+ TAMs, were enriched in PVTT. C5aR+ TAMs contribute to the development of PVTT and poor prognosis by reshaping the immunosuppressive environment.",0
"BackgroundAs non-coding RNAs, exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) regulate colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, although the functional mechanisms by which such molecules affect the tumor microenvironment are still elusive. Herein, we aimed to explore the potential clinical significance of a signature of five serum-derived circRNAs in CRC and investigated the mechanisms underlying endothelial cell angiogenesis mediated by CRC-secreted exosomal circ_001422.MethodsThe expression of a signature of five serum-derived circRNAs (circ_0004771, circ_0101802, circ_0082333, circ_0072309, and circ_001422) were measured by RT-qPCR, and their associations with tumor staging and lymph node metastasis were further evaluated in CRC patients. In silico analysis was used to show the relationship between circ_001422, miR-195-5p, and KDR, validated by dual-luciferase reporter and Western blotting assays. CRC cell-derived exosomes were isolated and characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Western blotting. Endothelial cell uptake of PKH26-labeled exosomes was demonstrated using a spectral confocal microscope. In vitro genetic strategies were used to exogenously alter the expression level of circ_001422 and miR-195-5p expression. Cell proliferation assay, transwell migration assay, and capillary tube formation assay were conducted to explore the role of CRC-secreted exosomal circ_001422 in endothelial cell function in vitro.ResultsThe expression levels of serum-derived circ_0004771, circ_0101802, circ_0082333, and circ_001422 were significantly higher in CRC and were positively correlated with the lymph node metastasis status. However, circ_0072309 showed a significant down-regulation in CRC than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, a higher expression level of circ_001422 in both cellular and exosomal fractions was found in HCT-116 CRC cells. We found that HCT-116 exosomes considerably enhanced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells through shuttling of circ_001422. We also observed that exosomes derived from HCT-116 cell, but not non-aggressive Caco-2 CRC cells, increased in vitro tubulogenesis of endothelial cells. Importantly, knockdown of circ_001422 impaired the capability of endothelial cells to form the capillary-like tube structures. CRC-secreted circ_001422 acted as an endogenous miR-195-5p sponge to inhibit miR-195-5p activity, which led to increased KDR expression and mTOR signaling activation in endothelial cells. Importantly, ectopic expression of miR-195-5p mimicked the effect of circ_001422 silencing on KDR/mTOR signaling in endothelial cells.ConclusionThis study attributed a biomarker role for circ_001422 in CRC diagnosis and proposed a novel mechanism whereby circ_001422 up-regulates KDR through sponging miR-195-5p. These interactions may give rise to the activation of mTOR signaling and may be a possible clarification for the pro-angiogenesis effects of CRC-secreted exosomal circ_001422 on endothelial cells.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05095-1.","BackgroundLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens people’s health worldwide. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in regulating LUAD growth and metastasis as well as in therapeutic response. However, currently, there is a lack of integrative analysis of PCD-related signatures of LUAD for accurate prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response.MethodsThe bulk transcriptome and clinical information of LUAD were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. A total of 1382 genes involved in regulating 13 various PCD patterns (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, netotic cell death, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, parthanatos, autophagy-dependent cell death, oxeiptosis, alkaliptosis and disulfidptosis) were included in the study. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were performed to identify PCD-associated differential expression genes (DEGs). An unsupervised consensus clustering algorithm was used to explore the potential subtypes of LUAD based on the expression profiles of PCD-associated DEGs. Univariate Cox regression analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, Random Forest (RF) analysis and stepwise multivariate Cox analysis were performed to construct a prognostic gene signature. The “oncoPredict” algorithm was utilized for drug-sensitive analysis. GSVA and GSEA were utilized to perform function enrichment analysis. MCPcounter, quanTIseq, Xcell and ssGSEA algorithms were used for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. A nomogram incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics was established to predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.ResultsForty PCD-associated DEGs related to LUAD were obtained by WGCNA analysis and differential expression analysis, followed by unsupervised clustering to identify two LUAD molecular subtypes. A programmed cell death index (PCDI) with a five-gene signature was established by machine learning algorithms. LUAD patients were then divided into a high PCDI group and a low PCDI group using the median PCDI as a cutoff. Survival and therapeutic analysis revealed that the high PCDI group had a poor prognosis and was more sensitive to targeted drugs but less sensitive to immunotherapy compared to the low PCDI group. Further enrichment analysis showed that B cell-related pathways were significantly downregulated in the high PCDI group. Accordingly, the decreased tumor immune cell infiltration and the lower tumor tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) scores were also found in the high PCDI group. Finally, a nomogram with reliable predictive performance PCDI was constructed by incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics, and a user-friendly online website was established for clinical reference ( performed the first comprehensive analysis of the clinical relevance of genes regulating 13 PCD patterns in LUAD and identified two LUAD molecular subtypes with distinct PCD-related gene signature which indicated differential prognosis and treatment sensitivity. Our study provided a new index to predict the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and the prognosis of LUAD patients for guiding personalized treatments.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05000-w.",0
"Although small-molecule inhibitors with moderate efficacy targeting MYC have been previously described, to this point, research efforts have failed to bring a suitable small-molecule MYC inhibitor to the clinic. Herein, the discovery of a series of novel MYC degraders bearing VHL to target the “undruggable” MYC is presented. The molecules are based on connecting a known MYC binder to a VHL ligand or pomalidomide to induce MYC degradation in various cancer cells known to express MYC. Representative compounds from our work induced MYC degradation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Selected compounds, CSI86 and CSI107, displayed antiproliferative activity (IC50 values of 13–18 μM) against breast and prostate cancer cells. The lead molecules were further evaluated in terms of cell uptake, potential to degrade MYC, and pharmacokinetics in mice. Encouraging results presented herein suggest that the presented analogs may serve as prototype structures of future therapeutic agents for the treatment of MYC-dependent tumors. MYC protein degraders can well complement the more established inhibition approaches that have been presented in the past (for example, disruption of the MYC–MAX complex formation by small-molecule inhibitors).","PurposeCell death plays an important role in tumourigenesis and progression; nevertheless, the clinical significance of cell death-related genes in neuroblastoma remains incompletely understood.MethodsWe separately constructed the corresponding risk scores for each of the eight cell death pathways separately and assessed their predictive performance. Through Cox regression analysis, these eight risk scores were integrated to obtain final cell death risk scores (CDRS). We evaluated the predictive performance of CDRS in multiple datasets and compared its accuracy with the clinical characteristics of patients and some existing prognostic models for neuroblastoma. We then explored the differences in immune infiltration between the high and low CDRS groups, and the significance of CDRS on EFS and disease progression.ResultsAll eight risk scores have high predictive accuracy, with the Immunogenic-RS being the most accurate and the cuproptosis-RS the least accurate. Model genes are mainly enriched in a variety of cancer-related pathways and are closely related to the clinical characteristics. CDRS showed superior and robust predictive performance in multiple datasets and was more accurate than the clinical characteristics of patients and some existing prognostic models for neuroblastoma. High CDRS group featured distinct immune cold tumor profiles and may have poorer immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy. CDRS had significance in predicting EFS and disease progression.ConclusionWe integrated risk scores associated with multiple cell death pathways to develop a high-performing and robust neuroblastoma signature. CDRS was a promising tool that may help with risk assessment and prediction of overall prognosis, and thus improve clinical outcomes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04605-5.",0
"Introduction:Cancer associated thrombosis (CAT) is a significant complication for patients with cancer. This review summarizes an updated epidemiology of CAT in the past decade.Methods:A systematic review was conducted on relevant population cohort studies published 2011–2024.Results:The 12-month incidence of CAT among patients with unselected cancers is approximately 3–5% (9-fold increase vs. matched non-cancer population); although the risk increases to 6–8% in patients with advanced cancers requiring systemic therapy (20-fold increase vs. matched non-cancer population). Despite improvement in anticoagulation usage and adherence, recurrence risk remains high at 5–8% at 6 months and 7–15% at 12 months. Important clinical predictors of CAT development are cancer type, cancer stage, cancer treatment, prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) history, prolonged hospitalization or immobilization, and obesity. Several clinical risk prediction scores for CAT utilizing the initial Khorana score backbone have been externally validated, and the modified Vienna-CATS (Pabinger 2018) and EHR-CAT (Li 2023) have the highest performance (Area Under the Curve 0.68–0.71), though more studies are needed to ensure adequate implementation and usage of these models.Conclusion:CAT remains a significant complication for patients with cancer even with modern antineoplastic therapies. We encourage multidisciplinary collaborations between hematologists, oncologists, epidemiologists, and data scientists to ensure the adoption of personalized VTE risk assessment in routine oncologic care.","ObjectiveSMARCD1 is a part of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex family, which consists of transcription factors that are implicated in various types of cancer. Examining SMARCD1 expression in human cancers can provide valuable insights into the development and progression of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM).MethodsOur study comprehensively examined the association between SMARCD1 expression and numerous factors, including prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME), immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) in SKCM. Then we utilized immunohistochemical staining to measure the SMARCD1 expression in both SKCM tissues and normal skin tissues. Furthermore, we conducted in vitro experimentation to evaluate the effects of SMARCD1 knockdown on SKCM cells.ResultsWe found that aberrant expression of SMARCD1 across 16 cancers was strongly correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In addition, our research revealed that SMARCD1 expression is associated with multiple factors in different types of cancer, including immune infiltration, TME, immune-related genes, MSI, TMB, and sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. SMARCD1 is likely involved in various SKCM signaling pathways and biological processes. Additionally, our research revealed that an SMARCD1-based risk factor model accurately predicted OS in SKCM patients. Furthermore, the downregulation of SMARCD1 expression demonstrated a significant inhibition of SKCM cell proliferation and migration, as well as an increase in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.ConclusionWe conclude that SMARCD1 is a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarker for SKCM, and its expression has significant clinical implications for the development of novel treatment strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05064-8.",0
"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been associated with susceptibility and protection against a number of cancers. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to evaluate the overall influence of 127 HLA Class I and II alleles on 30 types of cancer. We found a preponderance of protective alleles (negatively correlated with cancer prevalences), especially for HLA Class I. Of the 30 cancers investigated, 13 were associated with mostly protective HLA effects whereas only 2 were associated with mostly susceptibility HLA alleles. Taken together, these findings highlight the broad influence of HLA on cancer and the complexity of HLA-cancer associations.","BackgroundIn this study, we used immune repertoire (IR) sequencing technology to profile the diversity of peripheral blood T cell receptors and used transcriptomics to profile the gene expression of peripheral blood neutrophil mRNA in patients with mild-moderate knee osteoarthritis (KOA) before and after electroacupuncture (EA) treatment.MethodsAn 8-week intervention with EA was performed on 3 subjects with KOA. IR sequencing of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) was performed using RNA extracted from peripheral blood T cells of KOA subjects prior to and at the end of the intervention, as well as healthy volunteers (controls) who matched the subjects in sex and age. Neutrophils were extracted from the plasma of healthy individuals, pretreatment patients, and posttreatment patients for further transcriptome sequencing.ResultsThe D50, diversity index (DI), and Shannon entropy values of circulatory T-cells were significantly lower in pretreatment KOA patients compared to healthy controls. Posttreatment KOA samples displayed significant decreases in serum proinflammatory factors, IL-8 and IL-18 (P < 0.01), as well as a substantial reduction in serum matrix MMP-3 and MMP-13 (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of CXCL2, IRF8, and PEAR1 (P < 0.05) was significantly higher in patients before the treatment than in the healthy population and was significantly down-regulated after the treatment. In contrast, the expression of SMPD3 (P < 0.05) showed the opposite trend.ConclusionEA may alleviate KOA by rebalancing T-cell homeostasis and improving systemic inflammation. At the same time, EA treatment can significantly enhance TCR diversity, reduce levels of proinflammatory factors, and increase levels of anti-inflammatory factors, thereby achieving therapeutic effects.Clinical Trial registrationNCT 03366363.",0
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have brought new hope for the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) over the past decades. However, the overall response rate is limited, and is lower than that in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This is in part because of the lack of pre-existing tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TITLs), especially cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), in the SCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in insufficient anti-tumor immune response. To unleash the full potential of ICIs, the trafficking and infiltration of TITLs to the tumor is necessary and tightly regulated, the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment blunts the infiltration and function of TITLs that reach the tumor in SCLC. Here, we review the characteristics of TITLs, the effects of various factors on T cell infiltration, and possible strategies to restore or promote T cell infiltration in the TME of SCLC.","There is a critical need for biomarkers of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in organ transplantation. We hypothesized that ACR leads to changes in donor-reactive T cell small extracellular vesicle (sEV) profiles in transplant recipient circulation that match the kinetics of alloreactive T cell activation. In rodent heart transplantation, circulating T cell sEV quantities (P < .0001) and their protein and mRNA cargoes showed time-specific expression of alloreactive and regulatory markers heralding early ACR in allogeneic transplant recipients but not in syngeneic transplant recipients. Next generation sequencing of their microRNA cargoes identified novel candidate biomarkers of ACR, which were validated by stem loop quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (n = 10). Circulating T cell sEVs enriched from allogeneic transplant recipients mediated targeted cytotoxicity of donor cardiomyocytes by apoptosis assay (P < .0001). Translation of the concept and EV methodologies to clinical heart transplantation demonstrated similar upregulation of circulating T cell sEV profiles at time points of grade 2 ACR (n = 3 patients). Furthermore, T cell receptor sequencing of T cell sEV mRNA cargo demonstrated expression of T cell clones with intact complementarity determining region 3 signals. These data support the diagnostic potential of T cell sEVs as noninvasive biomarker of ACR and suggest their potential functional roles.",1
"PurposeColon cancer (CC) is a cancer of the large intestine with high prevalence and poor prognosis. enhancer RNAs. Therefore, valuable tools or biomarkers for predicting patient status, directing clinical practice, and reducing overtreatment are needed. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs transcribed from enhancers, have been shown to function as regulators of oncogene or tumor suppressor gene expression. The aim of our study was to explore the potential roles of eRNAs and their target enhancer-related genes (ERGs) in the prognosis of CC.MethodsSelected CC cases (stage I–III) from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were used as a training set, and cases from the Gene Expression Omnibus were used as the validation set. ERGs associated with prognosis were screened through three steps: potential, candidate, and prognosis ERGs. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors, and a nomogram was created. Calibration curves were drawn by comparing predicted and observed survival probability. For validation, the calibration curves and ROC analysis were also applied to two external validation sets. The biological significance and clinical application of the genes obtained were investigated.ResultsBased on the multiple tiers of strict screening, 11 prognostic ERGs were obtained, which were combined to obtain a prognosis signature. A compound nomogram integrating age, TNM classification, and the prognostic signature was constructed. The model was reliable in distinguishing the risk of patients with stage I–III CC, with AUCs of 0.78 and 0.70 at 5 and 7 years, respectively. There was good reproducibility in calibration curves. The prognostic model also yielded good prediction capability in the validation sets.ConclusionIn this study, the usefulness and specificity of the ERGs in prognosis were described, which should be considered a key feature in the clinical guidance of CC patients with early stage. We concluded that the major implications of the eRNAs and ERGs should be valued, which would be an emerging hallmark in the prognosis of cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05130-1.","Objective:There are significant disparities in outcomes among Hispanic patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recent studies have demonstrated favorable outcomes of pegaspargase-containing ALL regimens (PEG-CAR) in young adults however, outcomes in Hispanic ethnicity continue to be underreported.Methods:We evaluated outcomes of newly diagnosed, adult B-cell ALL Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients consecutively treated with a PEG-CAR or HyperCVAD between January 2011 and November 2022. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) while secondary endpoints included cumulative incidence of relapse and overall survival (OS).Results:Among 105 included patients, 48 (45.7%) were treated with a PEG-CAR and 57 (54.3%) with HyperCVAD. Median age was 38 years (range, 18–75 years), 61% were Hispanic, and 35.2% had poor-genetic risk. Hispanic patients demonstrated significantly worse 5-year EFS with a PEG-CAR compared to that seen with HyperCVAD (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.32–5.04; p = .006) whereas non-Hispanic patients had better outcomes with PIR (52.4% vs. 42.0%). Hispanic ethnicity (p = .015) and male sex (p = .019) were independent predictors for poor OS.Conclusions:Hispanic patients with B-cell ALL had worse EFS with a PEG-CAR as compared with HyperCVAD. Future studies will aim to confirm these findings and establish a tailored treatment approach for this high-risk population.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDThe paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are an uncommon phenomenon with diverse clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of PNS is often challenging because of the broad range of clinical manifestations and the difficulties in the detection of antibodies (AB) that are confirmatory for the diagnosis. Recently published Updated Diagnostic Criteria for PNS improved the efficacy and accuracy of clinical practice but leaves a “gray zone”. The utilization of immunotherapy is rapidly expanding, but the safety and the efficacy of the immunotherapy in PNS patients are unclear as well. Managing PNS is challenging, as there is no consensus on the type of immunomodulatory therapy and the indications for advanced treatment lines. MATERIAL AND METHODSWe retrospectively evaluated the data about the case of PNS treated in the neurology department and Neuro-oncology unit at Sheba MC Israel. RESULTS68 years old male was hospitalized at July 2022 with C7-T3 myelopathy syndrome. The evaluation was negative excluding protein 75 mg/dl and mild pleocytosis, but negative cytology. There was clinical improvement after Methylprednisolon treatment. At March 2023 the patient admitted with acute onset of Lt. hemiparesis and Lt. hemihypoesthesia that developed three weeks after COVID-19 infection. PNS panels of high-risk and low-risk AB in serum and CSF were negative. The Brain MRI showed Rt. thalamic and internal capsule lesion that was hyperintense in FLAIR sequence and homogeneously enhanced by contrast in T1 sequence. The lesion was diagnosed as TUMEFACTIVE demyelinating lesion. Transient clinical and radiological response on steroids treatment was reached. The systemic evaluation revealed the Rt. axillary mass that was diagnosed as BRAF V600E mutated melanoma and case was diagnose as probable PNS. The treatment by BRAF and MEK inhibitors was started and sustained clinical and radiological neurological improvement and oncological complete response were reached.CONCLUSIONMany questions arise while making therapeutic decisions that relate to PNS. One of those is the question of if cancer therapy alone is sufficient and if it is possible to skip the advanced immunomodulatory treatment lines, because immunosuppression constitutes an aggravating prognostic factor for oncological outcome. New targeted oncological therapies have a short time to response which makes this therapeutic approach possible and our case illustrates the concept.","The crucial role of steroid hormones in health and diseases merits their high-throughput, accurate and affordable measurements in biological specimens. Despite advances in analytical methods, sensing and quantifying steroid hormones remains challenging. Immunoassays offer excellent sensitivity but are inherently labour-intensive, costly, and prone to false positives. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been increasingly utilised, with the main hurdle being the isobaric tendencies of similar analytes, which complicates their separation and accurate quantification. This study compares ultrahigh-performance supercritical fluid chromatography separation (UHPSFC) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) for MS detection. It optimises the column chemistry, temperature, and pressure to provide an operational protocol for the resolution and quantification of analytes. It presents the systematic characterisation of UHPSFC-MS performance by investigating spiked blood samples using Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) and describes the matrix effects associated with MS measurements. Although both separation methods showed adequate resolution, specificity, and retention time, UHPSFC-MS was superior for five out of seven columns tested. With added high-throughput capacities, UHPSFC-MS, thus, offers an optimal solution for the analysis of steroid hormones for research, medical chemistry, and clinical diagnostics.",0
"ABSTRACTTreatment of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) has evolved over the last decade. According to studies, the use of targeted therapies has significantly increased the life expectancy of patients. Moreover, ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have improved clinical outcomes. In Lebanon, translating recommendations into clinical practice remains challenging. A Lebanese expert panel of oncologists was convened to describe the management paradigm and the clinical evidence supporting the optimal use of next-generation TKIs in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC and to provide an expert overview of local challenges and recommendations for optimizing the management of advanced NSCLC in Lebanese patients. The experts agreed that these recommendations should be part of a healthcare strategy to be implemented at the national level.","Significance:Cellular senescence is a critical process underlying aging and is associated with age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Lipids are implicated in cellular senescence. Fatty acids, particularly eicosanoids, have been associated with various forms of senescence and inflammation, and the associated reactive oxygen species production has been proposed as a therapeutic target for mitigating senescence. When overactivated, calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins.Recent Advances:With a growing understanding of the importance of lipids as mediators and modulators of senescence, cPLA2 has emerged as a compelling drug target. cPLA2 overactivation plays a significant role in several pathways associated with senescence, including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.Critical Issues:Previous cPLA2 inhibitors have shown potential in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress, but the dominant hurdles in the central nervous system-targeting drug discovery are specificity and blood–brain barrier penetrance.Future Directions:With the need for more effective drugs against neurological diseases, we emphasize the significance of discovering new brain-penetrant, potent, and specific cPLA2 inhibitors. We discuss how the recently developed Virtual Synthon Hierarchical Enumeration Screening, an iterative synthon-based approach for fast structure-based virtual screening of billions of compounds, provides an efficient exploration of large chemical spaces for the discovery of brain-penetrant cPLA2 small-molecule inhibitors.

"Summary paragraph:Interleukin-15 (IL15) promotes the survival of T lymphocytes and enhances the antitumor properties of CAR T cells in preclinical models of solid neoplasms in which CAR T cells have limited efficacy1-4. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is expressed in a group of solid cancers5-10, and here we report the first evaluation in humans of the effects of IL15 co-expression on GPC3-CAR T cells. Cohort 1 patients (NCT02905188/NCT02932956) received GPC3-CAR T cells, which were safe but produced no objective antitumor responses and reached peak expansion at two weeks. Cohort 2 patients (NCT05103631/NCT04377932) received GPC3-CAR T cells that co-expressed IL15 (15.CAR), which mediated significantly increased cell expansion and induced a disease control rate of 66% and antitumor response rate of 33%. Infusion of 15.CAR T cells was associated with increased incidence of cytokine release syndrome, which was rapidly ameliorated by activation of the inducible caspase 9 safety switch. Compared to non-responders, tumor-infiltrating 15.CAR T cells from responders showed repression of SWI/SNF epigenetic regulators and upregulation of FOS and JUN family members as well as genes related to type I interferon signaling. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IL15 increases the expansion, intratumoral survival, and antitumor activity of GPC3-CAR T cells in patients.","Wilms’ tumor (WT1), a transcription factor highly expressed in various leukemias and solid tumors, is a highly specific intracellular tumor antigen, requiring presentation through complexation with HLA-restricted peptides.. WT1-derived epitopes are able to assemble with MHC-I and thereby be recognized by T cell receptors (TCR). Identification of new targetable epitopes derived from WT1 on solid tumors is a challenge, but meaningful for the development of therapeutics that could in this way target intracellular oncogenic proteins. In this study, we developed and comprehensively describe methods to validate the formation of the complex of WT1126–134 and HLA-A2. Subsequently, we developed an antibody fragment able to recognize the extracellular complex on the surface of cancer cells. The single chain variable fragment (scFv) of an established TCR-mimic antibody, specifically recognizing the WT1-derived peptide presented by the HLA-A2 complex, was expressed, purified, and functionally validated using a T2 cell antigen presentation model. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of the WT1-derived peptide as a targetable extracellular antigen in multiple solid tumor cell lines. Our study describes methodology for the evaluation of WT1-derived peptides as tumor-specific antigen on solid tumors, and may facilitate the selection of potential candidates for future immunotherapy targeting WT1 epitopes.",0
"Purpose Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. To improve the therapeutic outcomes, drug delivery systems, and particularly liposomes, have been widely investigated. Therefore, this review analyzed systematically the literature to inquire about the safety and efficacy of liposomal formulations in lung cancer treatment.MethodsThree electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL) were systematically searched until May 2020. Clinical trials containing information about the effects of liposomal formulations in lung cancer patients were considered eligible.ResultsTwenty two selected studies present different treatment options for both small and non-small-cell lung cancers. After compiling and analyzing all the published information, we verified that combination of liposomal cisplatin and paclitaxel led to a statistically significant improvement of the evaluated outcomes. Moreover, tecemotide, a liposome-based immunotherapy, demonstrated lower toxicity compared to control groups. Evidences that other subgroups could benefit from this formulation were also provided.ConclusionThis systematic review (registration number CRD42021246587) demonstrates that liposomal formulations are promising alternatives to overcome limitations of traditional cancer therapy. However, larger, longer, randomized and double-blinded clinical trials, selecting their patients’ cohort considering more responsive subgroups would be beneficial to strengthen the scientific and clinical evidence of the results herein reported.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04079-x.","PurposeWe aimed to investigate whether induction chemotherapy with less than four courses is as effective as induction chemotherapy with more than four courses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy.MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 249 patients with NSCLC who received chemoimmunotherapy at 12 centers in Japan between January and December 2019. The patient group that completed less than four courses owing to adverse events (AEs), and received subsequent maintenance therapy was compared to the group that received at least four courses of induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsOn univariate and multivariate analyses, the patient group that transitioned to maintenance therapy after completing less than four courses of induction chemotherapy had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those who completed at least four courses (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.38–3.37, p < 0.001 and HR 2.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.40–3.84, p = 0.001, respectively). There was no obvious difference in PFS between the group in which induction chemotherapy ended in two or three courses leading to partial or complete response, and the group that continued at least four courses of induction chemotherapy (log-rank test p = 0.53).ConclusionTreatment efficacy may be maintained if induction chemotherapy is completed in less than four courses owing to development of AEs, and is administered for more than two courses with partial or complete response; efficacy is maintained even on transitioning to maintenance therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03782-5.",1
"This study investigated the role of swimming exercise in regulating melanoma tumour growth and glycolysis in cancer cells, the specific mechanism involved was also studied. In our study, a murine melanoma tumour model was established to assess the impact of swimming on tumour growth. The mRNA and protein expressions were assessed using qRT-PCR, western blot, and IHC. The metabolic behavior of melanoma cells was examined through lactic acid level measurements and glucose consumption assessments. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to detect cell viability and proliferation. ELISA was employed to determine the levels of cytokines secreted by macrophages. The interaction between APOL3 and STAT3 was analyzed by dual luciferase reporter gene and ChIP assays. Our results demonstrated that swimming exercise suppressed melanoma growth in mice by suppressing glycolysis, which might be related to APOL3 upregulation. In addition, downregulation of APOL3 in melanoma was associated with poor prognosis, and APOL3 overexpression markedly suppressed melanoma cell proliferation by reducing glucose uptake and lactate production in vitro. Mechanistically, STAT3 directly down-regulated APOL3 transcription. Swimming upregulated APOL3 by inactivating the IL-6R-STAT3 signaling axis in melanoma cells by inhibiting the secretion of IL-6 by M2 macrophages. As expected, IL-6 secreted by M2 macrophages promoted glycolysis in melanoma cells by reducing APOL3 expression. In summary, swimming inactivated the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling axis in melanoma cells by inhibiting the secretion of IL-6 by M2 macrophages, which could suppress the growth of melanoma in the body by upregulating APOL3 to inhibit glycolysis.","Background:Metastatic melanoma of the ampulla of Vater is rare. The purpose of this study was to summarize the characteristics and outcomes of metastatic melanoma in the ampulla of Vater and highlight the impact of surgery on the prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma.Methods:Pooled data from a case encountered at our institution and from all sporadic cases published on PubMed and MEDLINE between 1996 and 2023 were analyzed.Results:Fourteen patients with metastatic melanoma in the ampulla of Vater were enrolled. Ten (73%) of primary melanomas were cutaneous and two were mucosal. Jaundice was the most common symptom (86%). The size of metastatic melanoma to the ampulla ranged from 1.5 to 8 cm, with a median of 2.75 cm. Concomitant metastasis to other organs occurred in 82% of the patients at the time of diagnosis, most commonly in the brain, lungs, and liver (36% each). Among the reported cases, pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in five patients. The overall 1-year survival rate was 27.3%, with a median survival of 4 months. Wide excision of the primary lesion and chemotherapy significantly improved survival rates (50% vs. 0%, p = 0.048).Conclusion:There may be a trend toward improved survival in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by chemotherapy. Given the availability of effective systemic therapies, metastatic melanoma of the ampulla of Vater does not necessarily preclude major surgeries.",1
"AbstractRecent interest has been in using mIDH inhibitors in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas. This review paper summarizes the indications, side effects, recommended dosing, and management for patients on ivosidenib and vorasidenib.","AbstractBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are considered standard‐of‐care in the systemic treatment of melanoma. However, management of certain ICI‐associated adverse events (AE) can be challenging. Incidence, course and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor‐induced pancreatic injury (ICIPI) are not well‐documented and specific diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are lacking. Current management includes serological monitoring of pancreatic enzymes, radiographic imaging and corticosteroid or further immunosuppressive treatment. Objectives: Based on previous data regarding adjuvant ICI treatment, we suspected that elevation of pancreatic enzymes may occur more frequently than reported while the clinical relevance of—particularly asymptomatic—ICIPI is still unclear.MethodsA collaboration of eight Austrian and Swiss dermato‐oncology centres was established to retrospectively analyse a large cohort of ICI‐treated patients regarding incidence and management of ICIPI. Additionally, a questionnaire‐based survey concerning ICIPI‐management was conducted.ResultsAmong 1516 melanoma patients receiving ICI therapy, 204 patients exhibited ≥CTCAE II° lipase elevation. Of these patients, 41 (20.1%) had symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis. Immunotherapy was interrupted or discontinued due to pancreatic AE in almost half of the patients. Systemic corticosteroids were administered in 103 patients (50.5%), with higher doses reported in symptomatic cases. Six per cent of asymptomatic patients had radiographically proven pancreatitis. Maximum lipase elevation was >5xULN in all of these patients.ConclusionsRoutine lipase monitoring was conducted in all participating centres, although not recommended in respective guidelines. Elevation of serum lipase was observed more frequently than recently reported. Although radiographic findings indicating pancreatitis were rare in asymptomatic patients, ICI treatment was frequently paused or discontinued and systemic steroids were administered. To reduce the existing uncertainty in routine clinical practice reflected by our findings, we provide an algorithm to guide the monitoring and management of potential pancreatic adverse events. Lipase measurement should be limited to symptomatic patients and/or those with radiographic findings indicative of pancreatic injury.",0
"AbstractBackgroundHuman gliomas are classified using isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status as a prognosticator; however, the influence of genetic differences and treatment effects on ensuing immunity remains unclear.MethodsIn this study, we used sequential single-cell transcriptomics on 144 678 and spectral cytometry on over 2 million immune cells encompassing 48 human gliomas to decipher their immune landscape.ResultsWe identified 22 distinct immune cell types that contribute to glioma immunity. Specifically, brain-resident microglia (MG) were reduced with a concomitant increase in CD8+ T lymphocytes during glioma recurrence independent of IDH status. In contrast, IDH-wild type-associated patterns, such as an abundance of antigen-presenting cell-like MG and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, were observed. Beyond elucidating the differences in IDH, relapse, and treatment-associated immunity, we discovered novel inflammatory MG subpopulations expressing granulysin, a cytotoxic peptide that is otherwise expressed in lymphocytes only. Furthermore, we provide a robust genomic framework for defining macrophage polarization beyond M1/M2 paradigm and reference signatures of glioma-specific tumor immune microenvironment (termed GlioTIME-36) for deconvoluting transcriptomic datasets.ConclusionsThis study provides advanced optics of the human pan-glioma immune contexture as a valuable guide for translational and clinical applications.","Background: Although the impact of tumor-immune infiltrate has been reported on differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) behavior, the expression of immune checkpoints [programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1)] alone has not been able to predict response to immunotherapies. We aimed to identify tumor-infiltrating immune cells and checkpoints associated with DTC.Methods: We performed multiplex immunofluorescence on deparaffinized thyroid tissue collected at thyroidectomy from 17 adults with DTC to characterize the tumor immune microenvironment for leukocytes (CD45+), T cells (CD3+), T regulatory cells (Tregs) (CD3+FOXP3+), CD4+ T cells (CD3+CD4+), CD8+ T cells (CD3+CD8+), macrophages (CD68+), M2 macrophages (CD68+CD163+), M1 Macrophages (CD68+ inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]+), and immune checkpoints PD-1 and PD-L1. We compared the mean percentage expression of immune markers between tumor and adjacent thyroid tissue from the same patient by paired t-test and performed spatial analysis along the tumor’s leading edge.Results: Immune checkpoints PD-1 and PD-L1 showed a significant increase in expression intratumorally as compared to adjacent thyroid tissue (p < 0.05). A higher trend for M2 macrophages was observed intratumorally compared to adjacent tissue. Along the leading edge, PD-L1 expression correlated negatively with CD45 and positively with CD163 intratumorally. On exploratory analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend for higher FOXP3 but less CD8 and iNOS expression in tumor from DTC with (n = 3) versus without distant metastases (n = 14). There was a nonsignificant trend for higher CD58 and iNOS expression in DTC with (n = 7) than without thyroiditis (n = 10).Conclusions: Higher tumoral PD-1 and PD-L1 expression indicate their role in DTC occurrence. A trend for more Tregs and M2 macrophages but less M1 macrophages intratumorally in patients with distant metastatic DTC, suggests their potential role as prognostic biomarkers. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to compare various clinicopathologic severities to harness tumor microenvironment for cancer prognostication and therapy.",0
"AbstractBackgroundUsing immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO) is a promising approach to maximize clinical benefits for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-L1 expression serves as a predictive factor for treatment outcomes with IO. However, the high cost of this treatment creates significant barriers to access. Substantial evidence demonstrates the sustained clinical benefits experienced by patients who respond to immunotherapy. While IOs show promise in NSCLC treatment, their high cost poses access barriers.AimThis study focused on a prospective cost analysis conducted at a high-specialty health facility to assess the economic implications of implementing a risk-sharing agreement (RSA) for atezolizumab in NSCLC.MethodsThe study included 30 patients with advanced NSCLC, with the pharmaceutical company funding the initial cycles. If patients responded, a government program covered costs until disease progression.ResultsA median progression-free survival of 4.67 months across populations, rising to 9.4 months for responders. The 2-year overall survival rate for the response group was 64%, significantly higher than for non-response. Without an RSA, a total treatment cost of $881 859.36 ($29 395.31/patient) was reported, compared to $530 467.12 ($17 682.24/patient) with an RSA, representing a 40% cost reduction. In responders, the average cost per year of life per patient dropped by 22%. Risk-sharing, assessed through non-parametric tests, showed a statistically significant difference in pharmacological costs (P < .001).ConclusionImplementing RSAs can optimize resource allocation, making IO treatment more accessible, especially in low-income countries.","Introduction:Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown great promise in a wide spectrum of malignancies. However, responses are not always durable, and this mode of treatment is only effective in a subset of patients. As such, there exists an unmet need for novel approaches to bolster ICI efficacy.Areas covered:We review the role of the Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinases in promoting tumor-induced immune suppression and discuss the benefits that may be derived from combining ICI with TAM kinase-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We searched the MEDLINE Public Library of Medicine (PubMed) and EMBASE databases and referred to ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant ongoing studies.Expert Opinion:Targeting of TAM kinases may improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. However, it remains to be determined whether this effect will be better achieved by the selective targeting of each TAM receptor, depending on the context, or by multi-receptor TAM inhibitors. Triple inhibition of all TAM receptors is more likely to be associated with increased risk for adverse events. Clinical trial designs should use high resolution clinical endpoints and proper control arms to determine the synergistic effects of combining TAM inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade.",1
"Cancer is a major global health burden, causing significant economic losses and premature deaths worldwide. Maintenance of telomeric repeats by telomerase makes the cancer cells immortal. Non-nucleoside mushroom metabolites were screened for their ability to stabilize RG4 structures, making telomeres inaccessible to telomerase and inducing telomere shortening in cancer cells. Selected mushroom metabolites, namely, Sterenin M, Melleolide K, and Zhankuic Acid A were docked with RG4 using the AutoDock Vina and evaluated for non-covalent interactions. These compounds were found to have strong binding affinity and manifested a set of molecular interactions with RG4. To assess the stability of complexes, state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the GROMACS 2018.7 software suite with the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field on 250 nanoseconds. Molecular docking and MD simulations revealed the strong interaction patterns between RG4 and the selected metabolites at the atomic level followed by binding free energy calculations. The results suggest that all three metabolites have the potential to be developed into therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to assess these compounds’ toxicity, efficacy, and dosage.","Due to the high toxicity, poor efficacy and resistance associated with current anti-breast cancer drugs, there’s growing interest in natural products (NPs) for their potential anti-cancer properties. Computational modelling of NPs to identify key structural features can aid in developing novel natural inhibitors. In this study, we developed statistically significant QSAR models based on NPs from the NPACT database, which have shown potential anticancer activity against the MCF-7 cancer cell lines. All the developed QSAR models were statistically robust, meeting both internal (R2 = 0.666–0.669, R2adj = 0.657–0.660, Q2Loo = 0.636–0.638) and external (Q2Fn = 0.686–0.714, CCCext = 0.830–0.847) validation criteria. Consequently, they were utilized to virtually screen a series of NPs from the COCONUT database in the search for novel natural inhibitors. Molecular docking studies were conducted on the identified compounds against the human HER2 protein (PDB ID: 3PP0), which is a crucial target in breast cancer. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that compounds 4608 and 2710 achieved the highest docking scores, with CDOCKER interaction energies of -72.67 kcal/mol and − 72.63 kcal/mol respectively. Compounds 4608 and 2710 were identified as the most promising candidates upon performing triplicate 100 ns MD simulation study using the CHARMM36 force field. DFT studies was performed to evaluate their stability and reactivity as potential drug molecules. This research contributes to the development of new natural inhibitors for breast cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00266-5.",1
"To more accurately diagnose and treat patients with different subtypes of thyroid cancer, we constructed a diagnostic model related to the iodine metabolism of THCA subtypes. THCA expression profiles, corresponding clinicopathological information, and single-cell RNA-seq were downloaded from TCGA and GEO databases. Genes related to thyroid differentiation score were obtained by GSVA. Through logistic analyses, the diagnostic model was finally constructed. DCA curve, ROC curve, machine learning, and K-M analysis were used to verify the accuracy of the model. qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression of hub genes in vitro. There were 104 crossover genes between different TDS and THCA subtypes. Finally, 5 genes (ABAT, CHEK1, GPX3, NME5, and PRKCQ) that could independently predict the TDS subpopulation were obtained, and a diagnostic model was constructed. ROC, DCA, and RCS curves exhibited that the model has accurate prediction ability. K-M and subgroup analysis results showed that low model scores were strongly associated with poor PFI in THCA patients. The model score was significantly negatively correlated with T cell follicular helper. In addition, the diagnostic model was significantly negatively correlated with immune scores. Finally, the results of qRT-PCR corresponded with bioinformatics results. This diagnostic model has good diagnostic and prognostic value for THCA patients, and can be used as an independent prognostic indicator for THCA patients.","Despite advances in neuroscience, limited progress has been made in developing new and better medications for psychiatric disorders. Available treatments in psychiatry rely on a few classes of drugs that have a broad spectrum of activity across disorders with limited understanding of mechanism of action. While the added value of more targeted therapies is apparent, a dearth of pathophysiologic mechanisms exists to support targeted treatments, and where mechanisms have been identified and drugs developed, results have been disappointing. Based on serendipity and early successes that led to the current drug armamentarium, a haunting legacy endures that new drugs should align with outdated and overinclusive diagnostic categories, consistent with the idea that “one size fits all”. This legacy has fostered clinical trial designs focused on heterogenous populations of patients with a single diagnosis and non-specific outcome variables. Disturbingly, this approach likely contributed to missed opportunities for drugs targeting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and now inflammation. Indeed, cause-and-effect data support the role of inflammatory processes in neurotransmitter alterations that disrupt specific neurocircuits and related behaviors. This pathway to pathology occurs across disorders and warrants clinical trial designs that enrich for patients with increased inflammation and use primary outcome variables associated with specific effects of inflammation on brain and behavior. Nevertheless, such trial designs have not been routinely employed, and results of anti-inflammatory treatments have been underwhelming. Thus, to accelerate development of targeted therapeutics including in the area of inflammation, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry must embrace treatments and trials focused on pathophysiologic pathways that impact specific symptom domains in subsets of patients, agnostic to diagnosis. Moreover, closer collaboration among basic and clinical investigators is needed to apply neuroscience knowledge to reveal disease mechanisms that drive psychiatric symptoms. Together, these efforts will support targeted treatments, ultimately leading to new and better therapeutics in psychiatry.",0
"AbstractBackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review synthesises all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making. It updates the previous version of the review, published in 2018.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both on overall survival, severe or life‐threatening adverse events, and quality of life in people undergoing first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.Search methodsWe searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CANCERLIT, and handsearched various sources for additional studies. The latest search dates were in March and July 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both with another intervention or best supportive care. Participants were required to have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer not amenable to curative intent treatment. Histological confirmation was required. Trials were required to report overall survival.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.Main resultsWe included 75 studies in the review and 51 in the meta‐analysis (11,333 participants). We divided the studies into seven categories: any anti‐cancer treatment versus best supportive care; various chemotherapy types versus gemcitabine; gemcitabine‐based combinations versus gemcitabine alone; various chemotherapy combinations versus gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel; fluoropyrimidine‐based studies; miscellaneous studies; and radiotherapy studies. In general, the included studies were at low risk for random sequence generation, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias, at unclear risk for allocation concealment, and high risk for performance bias.Compared to best supportive care, chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.33; absolute risk of death at 12 months of 971 per 1000 versus 962 per 1000; 4 studies, 298 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The adverse effects of chemotherapy and impacts on quality of life (QoL) were uncertain. Many of the chemotherapy regimens were outdated.Eight studies compared non‐gemcitabine‐based chemotherapy regimens to gemcitabine. These showed that 5‐fluorouracil (5FU) likely reduces OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27; risk of death at 12 months of 914 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 1 study, 126 participants; moderate certainty), and grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). Fixed dose rate gemcitabine likely improves OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; risk of death at 12 months of 683 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 644 participants; moderate certainty), and likely increase grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). FOLFIRINOX improves OS (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60; risk of death at 12 months of 524 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 652 participants; high certainty), and delays deterioration in QoL, but increases grade 3/4 adverse events.Twenty‐eight studies compared gemcitabine‐based combinations to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine plus platinum may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; risk of death at 12 months of 745 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 6 studies, 1140 participants; low certainty), may increase grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely worsens QoL. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improves OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; risk of death at 12 months of 722 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 10 studies, 2718 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely improves QoL. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitors result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; risk of death at 12 months of 770 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 3 studies, 839 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely does not alter QoL. Gemcitabine plus taxane result in a large improvement in OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; risk of death at 12 months of 644 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 986 participants; high certainty), and likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events and improves QoL.Nine studies compared chemotherapy combinations to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combination regimens improve OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; risk of death at 12 months of 542 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 6 studies, 1285 participants; high certainty). The treatment arms had distinct toxicity profiles, and there was little to no difference in QoL. Alternative schedules of gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel likely result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.47; risk of death at 12 months of 663 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 2 studies, 367 participants; moderate certainty) or QoL, but may increase grade 3/4 adverse events.Four studies compared fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations to fluoropyrimidines alone, with poor quality evidence. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations are likely to result in little to no impact on OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.15; risk of death at 12 months of 765 per 1000 versus 704 per 1000; P = 0.27; 4 studies, 491 participants; moderate certainty) versus fluoropyrimidines alone. The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in grade 3/4 adverse events or QoL between the two groups.We included only one radiotherapy (iodine‐125 brachytherapy) study with 165 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of radiotherapy on outcomes.Authors' conclusionsCombination chemotherapy remains standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus a taxane improve OS compared to gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that fluoropyrimidine‐based combination chemotherapy regimens improve OS compared to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. The effects of radiotherapy were uncertain as only one low‐quality trial was included. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individuals still remains unpersonalised, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to assist in rationalising treatment selection for patients.","AbstractBackgroundEarly‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in adults is commonly treated with combined modality treatment of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The role of radiotherapy has been questioned due to potential long‐term adverse effects.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.Search methodsWe updated all previous searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, MEDLINE and Embase, in trial registries and in relevant conference proceedings until November 2023.Selection criteriaWe included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and excluded trials with more than 20% of participants with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. We considered immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy eligible if both were applied similarly in the comparator groups, but did not identify such trials. For our comparisons, we separated RCTs with the same number of chemotherapy cycles in both arms and RCTs with a different number of cycles, when the chemotherapy regimens were the same. We separated RCTs which compared participants with a favourable, mixed or unfavourable risk profile.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of included trials. A third review author resolved discrepancies. We analysed time‐to‐event outcomes (overall survival, progression‐free survival) as hazard ratios (HR) and binary outcomes (adverse events) as risk ratios (RR). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.Main resultsWe included nine comparisons of eight RCTs involving 3840 participants in this updated review.Same number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseFor overall survival in individuals with favourable Hodgkin's lymphoma, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 7.92; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). Additional radiotherapy to chemotherapy is likely to improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.01 to 74.24; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and substantial imprecision) and suggests little to no difference in cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.16; 1 RCT, 667 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality or infertility.Mixed populationFor a population of mixed risk profile, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.80; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). It indicates that additional radiotherapy may lead to an improvement in progression‐free survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 10.87; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) and second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) (both very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but suggests that additional radiotherapy may increase cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.92; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with unfavourable disease, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.44; 2 RCTs, 688 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but additional radiotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.60; 1 RCT, 651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to imprecision). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.12 to 65.74; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality, second‐cancer related mortality or infertility.Different number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseThe evidence for overall survival in individuals with favourable disease treated with different numbers of chemotherapy cycles in both arms is uncertain and inclusive (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.38; 1 RCT, 357 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), yet it suggests a likely improvement in progression‐free survival with additional radiotherapy (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 RCT, 357 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). For second‐cancer‐related mortality, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.34; 1 RCT, 465 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality and infertility and data for cardiac disease‐related mortality were not estimable (no events in either group).Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with an unfavourable risk profile, additional radiotherapy may decrease overall survival slightly (HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.90; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision), but may slightly improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 6.90, 95% CI 0.36 to 132.34; 1 RCT, 276 participants), second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.77 to 6.19; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) and cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 8.22; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) (all very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Authors' conclusionsThe chemotherapy regimens in the trials differed and data for regimens commonly used today were limited. Additional radiotherapy may slightly improve progression‐free survival. The available data for overall survival and adverse events were of low and very low certainty, and we were unable to draw conclusions about the effects of additional radiotherapy on these outcomes. No studies evaluated infertility. High‐quality, longer‐term follow‐up data are required and data on fertility are needed.",1
"PurposeThis study aimed to explore the clinical implications of ctDNA for epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) as the first-line treatment in EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in real-world settings.MethodsA total of 122 patients with NSCLC who underwent tissue and liquid next generation sequencing (NGS) tests were included. 66 patients with detected EGFR mutation in both tumor-tissue and plasma were included into the EGFRt+, p+ group, and 56 patients with EGFR mutation detected only in tumor-tissue were included into the EGFRt+, p− group. The differences in clinical characteristics, concomitant mutations and prognosis between the two groups were compared.ResultsThe detection rate of the EGFRt+, p+ group was 54.1% (66/122). EGFRt+, p+ in the NGS test was particularly relevant to the size of tumors, liver metastasis, bone metastasis and TP53 mutation. In patients with TP53 mutation in ctDNA, the detection rate of EGFR mutation in ctDNA was up to 91.3%. EGFRt+, p+ could be an independent prognostic factor for first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment. Combination therapy seems to be a promising approach to improve the outcome for EGFRt+, p+ (P = 0.017, HR 0.509 [95% CI 0.288–0.897]). Moreover, the combination of TP53 mutated status and EGFRm status in plasma showed a better completion of risk stratification for PFS (Log-rank P < 0.001).ConclusionsCo-detection of EGFR mutation in tumor tissue and plasma is an independent prognostic factor for first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment. Moreover, combination therapy could be a promising approach to improve the outcome for these patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03952-z.","Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts that play a role in numerous malignant phenotypes, including hyperproliferation, invasion, and metastasis. These phenotypes correlate with activity of the Hippo pathway oncoprotein, Yes-associated protein-1 (YAP1), and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). YAP1/TAZ are normally involved in organ growth, under the regulation of various kinases and upon phosphorylation, are retained in the cytoplasm by chaperone proteins, leading to their proteasomal degradation. In CAFs and tumor cells, however, a lack of YAP1 phosphorylation results in its translocation to the nucleus, binding to TEAD transcription factors, and activation of mitogenic pathways. In this review we summarize the literature discussing the central role of YAP1 in CAF activation, the upstream cues that promote YAP1-mediated CAF activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and how CAFs mediate tumor-stroma crosstalk to support progression, invasion and metastasis in various cancer models. We further highlight YAP1+CAFs functions in modulating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and propose evaluation of several YAP1 targets regarding their role in regulating intra-tumoral immune landscapes. Finally, we propose that co-administration of YAP1- targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with advanced tumors.",0
"BackgroundMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a heterogeneous disease in which molecular stratification is needed to improve clinical outcomes. The identification of predictive biomarkers can have a major impact on the care of these patients, but the availability of metastatic tissue samples for research in this setting is limited.ObjectiveTo study the prevalence of immune biomarkers of potential clinical utility to immunotherapy in mCRPC and to determine their association with overall survival (OS).Design, setting, and participantsFrom 100 patients, mCRPC biopsies were assayed by whole exome sequencing, targeted next-generation sequencing, RNA sequencing, tumor mutational burden, T-cell–inflamed gene expression profile (TcellinfGEP) score (Nanostring), and immunohistochemistry for programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), SRY homology box 2 (SOX2), and the presence of neuroendocrine features.Outcome measurements and statistical analysisThe phi coefficient determined correlations between biomarkers of interest. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) from Cox regression.Results and limitationsPD-L1 and SOX2 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (combined positive score ≥1 and >5% cells, respectively) in 24 (33%) and 27 (27%) mCRPC biopsies, respectively; 23 (26%) mCRPC biopsies had high TcellinfGEP scores (>–0.318). PD-L1 protein expression and TcellinfGEP scores were positively correlated (phi 0.63 [0.45; 0.76]). PD-L1 protein expression (aHR: 1.90 [1.05; 3.45]), high TcellinfGEP score (aHR: 1.86 [1.04; 3.31]), and SOX2 expression (aHR: 2.09 [1.20; 3.64]) were associated with worse OS.ConclusionsPD-L1, TcellinfGEP score, and SOX2 are prognostic of outcome from the mCRPC setting. If validated, predictive biomarker studies incorporating survival endpoints need to take these findings into consideration.","PurposePolypharmacy is a common problem among older adults. However, its prevalence and impact on the clinical outcomes of anticancer treatment, such as survival and adverse events, in older patients with advanced cancer have not been well investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from Japanese patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 2016 and 2019.ResultsAmong 157 older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients, the prevalence of polypharmacy, defined as ≥ 5 medications, was 59.9% (94/157). The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication use, according to the screening tool of older people’s prescription (STOPP) criteria version 2, was 38.2% (60/157). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 3.7 and 5.5 months, respectively (P = 0.0017). The median overall survival (OS) in patients with and without polypharmacy was 9.5 and 28.1 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between polypharmacy and OS, but no significant associations between polypharmacy and PFS. Polypharmacy was not associated with immune-related adverse events but was associated with higher rate of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment (59.6% vs. 31.7%, P < 0.001).ConclusionPolypharmacy is an independent prognostic factor in older patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI. Also, polypharmacy could be utilized as a simple indicator of patients’ comorbidities and symptoms or as a predictive marker of unexpected hospitalizations during ICI treatment.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03252-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"PurposeThe CCR5/CCL5 axis is essential for interactions between malignant cells and microenvironment components, promoting tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study aims to evaluate the association of CCL5 and CCR5 with the behavior of oral cancer and assess the therapeutic potential of a CCR5 antagonist.MethodsA retrospective study to analyze CCR5 and CCL5 expression on paraffin-embedded tissues was performed. In cell lines, rhCCL5 was added to induce CCR5-related pathways, and Maraviroc and shRNA against CCR5 were used to neutralize the receptor. Finally, an in vivo murine orthotopic xenograft model of tongue cancer was used to evaluate Maraviroc as an oncologic therapy. After 15 days, the mice were killed, and the primary tumors and cervical lymph nodes were analyzed.ResultsThe expression of CCR5 was associated with clinical stage and metastasis, and CCL5 was related to overall survival. Adding rhCCL5 induced cell proliferation, while shRNA and Maraviroc reduced it in a dose-dependent manner. Maraviroc treatment also increased apoptosis and modified cytoskeletal organization. In vivo, Maraviroc reduced neck metastasis.ConclusionsThe effects of CCR5 antagonists in OSCC have been poorly studied, and this study reports in vitro and in vivo evidence for the effects of Maraviroc in OSCC. Our results suggest that the CCR5/CCL5 axis plays a role in oral cancer behavior, and that its inhibition is a promising new therapy alternative.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05443-1.","Introduction:Black males have the highest incidence and mortality rates from prostate cancer of any racial group in the United States, yet are underrepresented in prostate cancer clinical trials.Methods:The Prostate Health Education Network surveyed its members about experiences regarding prostate cancer clinical trials and explored reasons for lack of participation. Black males residing in the United States with a diagnosis of prostate cancer were eligible to participate.Results:Of 480 members contacted, 115 (24.0%) completed the survey. Respondents were diverse in age, geography, education, and socioeconomic status, and 58 (50.4%) had a family history of prostate cancer; 12 of 115 (10.4%) had participated in a prostate cancer clinical trial. The most common reasons for nonparticipation (N = 89) included not being asked (55.1%) and a lack of information about risks and benefits (13.5%). No respondents cited lack of trust in the healthcare system based on personal experience, although 2 (2.2%) cited the Tuskegee study. Factors that would influence future decisions around trial participation included whether respondents (N = 99) perceived the treatment or diagnostic option to be effective for themselves (54.5%), to have the potential to advance medical science (45.5%), and to have minimal side effects (44.4%).Conclusions:This survey of Prostate Health Education Network members found that the principal reason for Black males not participating in prostate cancer clinical trials was that they were not being asked. This highlights an unmet need for stronger collaboration between patients, health professionals, the pharmaceutical industry, and clinical trial investigators to address barriers to Black males enrolling in prostate cancer clinical trials.",0
"AbstractMental health issues are widespread and significant among individuals with serious illness. Among patients receiving palliative care (PC), psychiatric comorbidities are common and impact patient quality of life. Despite their prevalence, PC clinicians face challenges in effectively addressing the intricate relationship between medical and psychiatric disorders due to their complex, intertwined and bidirectionally influential nature. This article, created collaboratively with a team of psychiatric–palliative care experts, is the second in a two-part series examining the bidirectional relationship between medical and psychiatric illness in PC. This article explores 10 prevalent psychiatric manifestations associated with severe illness and its treatment. Building upon the first article, which focused on 10 common physical manifestations of psychiatric illness among patients receiving PC, these two articles advocate for an integrated approach to PC that prioritizes mental and emotional wellbeing across the continuum of serious illness.","PurposeDefining the phenotypic characteristics of CD8+ T cell subsets in gastric cancer (GC) can help remodel the immune microenvironment of the tumor, thereby improving patient prognosis. CD226 has recently been shown to regulate the activity of CD8+ T cell in several malignancies. However, the clinical relevance of CD226+CD8+ T cells in GC remains unclear.MethodsFudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) cohort (n = 316), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n = 407), KUGH/KUCM cohort (n = 202), and Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) cohort (n = 300) were included in prognosis and response to adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) analyses. Flow cytometry and multiplex immunostaining were used to characterize CD226+CD8+ T cells.ResultsCD226+CD8+ T cells predicted favorable outcomes in patients undergoing curative resection for GC. GC patients with high CD226+CD8+ T cell infiltration benefitted more from adjuvant chemotherapy. CD155 is upregulated in GC tissues and is associated with decreased intra-tumoral CD226+CD8+ T cell infiltration. The combination of intra-tumoral CD226+CD8+ T cells and CD155 is a strong prognostic predictor in patients with GC.ConclusionCD226+CD8+ T cells may represent a novel therapeutic target and a useful marker of prognosis and therapeutic response in patients with GC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04346-x.",0
"BackgroundsCuproptosis is the most recently identified copper-dependent cell death form that influences tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, the relationship between cuproptosis and clinical prognosis, tumor microenvironment infiltration (TME), and response to immunotherapy remains unclear.MethodsSingle-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was employed to construct cuproptosisScore (cpS) and 1378 gastric cancer (GC) patients from five independent public datasets were classified into high- or low-cpS groups according to the median of cpS. Then the impacts of cuproptosis on tumor microenvironment infiltration (TME), biological function, response to immunotherapy, and clinical prognosis of GC were evaluated. RiskScore and nomogram were constructed using Lasso Cox regression algorithm to validate its predictive capability in GC patients.ResultsCompared to patients with high cpS, patients with low cpS exhibited poorer prognosis, higher TNM stage, and stronger stromal activation. Meanwhile, the analysis of response to immunotherapy confirmed patients with high cpS could better benefit from immunotherapy and had a better susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs. Then, 9 prognosis-related signatures were collected based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of cpS groups. Finally, a riskScore model was constructed using the multivariate Cox (multi-Cox) regression coefficients of prognosis-related signatures and had an excellent capability of predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival in GC patients.ConclusionsThis study revealed the role of curproptosis in TME, response to immunotherapy, and clinical prognosis in GC, which highlighted the significant clinical implications of curproptosis and provided novel ideas for the therapeutic application of cuproptosis in GC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04474-4.","PurposeCuproptosis, a novel programmed cell death, plays an important role in glioma growth, angiogenesis, and immune response. Nonetheless, the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the prognosis and tumor microenvironment (TME) of gliomas remains unknown.MethodsBy non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering, 1286 glioma patients were classified based on the mRNA expression levels of 27 CRGs and investigated the association of immune infiltration and clinical characteristics with cuproptosis subtypes. A CRG-score system was constructed using LASSO and multivariate Cox regression methods and validated in independent cohorts to predict the prognosis of glioma patients.ResultsGlioma patients were divided into two cuproptosis subtypes. Cluster C2 was enriched in immune-related pathways, had higher macrophage M2, neutrophils, and CD8 + T cells, and poorer prognosis compared with cluster C1 which was enriched in metabolism-related pathways. We further constructed and validated the ten-gene CRG risk scores. Glioma patients in the high CRG-score group had higher tumor mutation burden, higher TME scores, and poorer prognoses compared with the low CRG-score group. Additionally, the AUC value of the CRG-score was 0.778 in predicting the prognosis of gliomas. WHO grading, IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT methylation were significant differences between high and low CRG-score groups.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that CRG-score was related to immune cell infiltration and could accurately predict gliomas’ prognosis. Our findings may provide a novel understanding of the potential role of cuproptosis molecular pattern and TME in the immune response and prognosis of glioma patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05021-5.",1
"BackgroundAdditional prognostic factors and personalized therapeutic alternatives for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC), especially for advanced stages with poor prognosis, are urgently needed.ObjectivesTo review and assess literature regarding underlying molecular mechanisms of VSCC target therapeutic and prognostic approaches.MethodsWe performed a narrative literature review from the inception of the database up to January 2020 limited to English language, organizing knowledge in five main fields: extracellular and intracellular cell cycle deregulation, tumor immune microenvironment, tumor angiogenesis and hormones.ResultsEGFR immunohistochemical overexpression/gene amplification, representing early events in VSCC carcinogenesis, have been correlated with a worse prognosis and led to inclusion of erlotinib in cancer guidelines. p16 expression and HPV positivity are linked to a better prognosis, while p53 overexpression is linked to a worse prognosis; thus, biomarkers could help tailoring conventional treatment and follow-up. The implications of PD-L1 positivity in reference to HPV status and prognosis are still not clear, even though pembrolizumab is part of available systemic therapies. The role of tumor angiogenesis emerges through data on microvessel density, immunohistochemical VEGF staining and evaluation of serum VEGF concentrations. Few data exist on hormonal receptor expression, even though hormonal therapy showed great manageability.ConclusionsWe suggest adding p16, p53 and HPV status to routine hystopathological examination of vulvar biopsies or surgical specimens. Predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs are needed. Enough preclinical data supporting anti-angiogenic target therapies in clinical trials are existing. Hormonal receptor expression deserves further investigation.","BackgroundCholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant epithelial tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis. Given the lack of therapeutic strategies and durable treatment options currently available, identifying innovative treatments for CCA is an urgent unmet clinical need. Cucurbitacin C (CuC) is a distinct variant of the cucurbitacin family, displaying promising anti-cancer activity against various tumor types. The primary objective of our research is to elucidate the promising effects of CuC on CCA.MethodsThe impact of CuC on CCA cell lines was assessed by cell count kit-8 assay, EdU staining assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing assay, and Transwell assay. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted to explore the function of CuC treatments on cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis in CCA cells. Computational biology and network pharmacology approaches were utilized to predict potential targets of CuC. Furthermore, a tumor xenograft mouse model was established using CCA cells to explore the anti-cancer effects of CuC in vivo.ResultsOur research findings revealed that CuC exerted a suppressive effect on CCA cell progression. Cell viability assays, EdU staining assays, and colony formation assays demonstrated that CuC effectively suppressed viability and proliferation of CCA cells. Wound-healing assays and Transwell assays indicated that CuC effectively inhibits the migratory and invasive capabilities of CCA cells. Flow cytometry analysis elucidated that CuC played its anti-proliferative role in CCA cells by arresting G0/G1 phase and increasing apoptosis. Through bioinformatics and network pharmacology analysis, in conjunction with western blot analysis, we demonstrated CuC mediated the inhibition of CCA cell progression through modulation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Additionally, the CCA xenograft tumor model was established, and the results supported the inhibition of CuC treatment against CCA progression in vivo.ConclusionOur study demonstrates that CuC possesses notable capabilities to suppress cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CCA. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of CuC on CCA progression are attributed to its modulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Altogether, our study demonstrated that CuC holds promise as a prospective therapeutic agent for treating CCA.",1
"KRAS is an important oncogenic driver which is mutated in numerous cancers. Recent advances in the selective targeting of KRAS mutants via small molecule inhibitors and targeted protein degraders have generated an increase in research activity in this area in recent years. As such, there is a need for new assay platforms to profile next generation inhibitors which improve on the potency and selectivity of existing drug candidates, while evading the emergence of resistance. Here, we describe the development of a new panel of biochemical and cell-based assays to evaluate the binding and function of known chemical entities targeting mutant KRAS. Our assay panels generated selectivity profiles and quantitative binding interaction dissociation constants for small molecules and degraders against wild type, G12C, G12D, and G12V KRAS, which were congruent with published data. These assays can be leveraged for additional mutants of interest beyond those described in this study, using both overexpressed cell-free systems and cell-based systems with endogenous protein levels.","AbstractMultifaceted natural killer (NK) cell activities are indispensable for controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmission and pathogenesis. Among the diverse functions of NK cells, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) has been shown to predict better HIV-1 protection. ADCC is initiated by the engagement of an Fc γ receptor CD16 with an Fc portion of the antibody, leading to phosphorylation of the CD3 ζ chain (CD3ζ) and Fc receptor γ chain (FcRγ) as well as downstream signaling activation. Though CD3ζ and FcRγ were thought to have overlapping roles in NK cell ADCC, several groups have reported that CD3ζ-mediated signals trigger a more robust ADCC. However, few studies have illustrated the direct contribution of CD3ζ in HIV-1-specific ADCC. To further understand the roles played by CD3ζ in HIV-1-specific ADCC, we developed a CD3ζ knockdown system in primary human NK cells. We observed that HIV-1-specific ADCC was inhibited by CD3ζ perturbation. In summary, we demonstrated that CD3ζ is important for eliciting HIV-1-specific ADCC, and this dynamic can be utilized for NK cell immunotherapeutics against HIV-1 infection and other diseases.",1
"ObjectiveIn recent decades, studies have underscored nuclear proteins and signaling pathways in prostate cancer (PCa) development. Key biomarkers like Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) are expressed in both healthy and malignant prostate cells. This study aimed to demonstrate the relationship between pathological characteristics, survival, recurrence, and tissue expression of EZH2 and FOXM1 in high-risk PCa patients.MethodsPCa tissues were used in a retrospective analysis that spanned from September 2009 to August 2019. Inclusion criteria comprised pathological tumor stage (pT) 3 patients with positive surgical margins or tumor proximity to inked margins within 5 mm. After case selection, tissue slides were stained for EZH2 and FOXM1 antibodies, and Allred scores were calculated. Patients or relatives of deceased patients were contacted for signed agreements and disease follow-ups.ResultsThe pT3b, ductal carcinoma component, and moderate EZH2 expression were associated with relapse (odds ratio [OR] 6.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41–27.27, p=0.016; OR 7.29, 95% CI 1.03–51.43, p=0.046; OR 5.96, 95% CI 1.09–32.48, p=0.039; respectively). The unilateral and bilateral seminal vesicle invasion increased the likelihood of recurrence by 9.98 times and 5.36 times, and the risk of death by around 9.78 times and 10.79 times, respectively. The pT3b was linked to higher death likelihood (OR 7.16, 95% CI 1.38–37.23, p=0.019), while moderate EZH2 expression did not show statistical significance (OR 4.54, 95% CI 0.87–23.60, p=0.072, marginally). Pathological regional lymph node stage (pN) 1 had significantly higher probability of mortality than pN unknown (3.9% vs. 27%, p<0.001). PCa in the neck and apex of the prostate gland increased death risk tenfold.ConclusionSufficient immunoexpression of EZH2, ductal carcinoma component, and neoplastic proliferation in the seminal vesicles, apex and neck of the prostate gland correlates with elevated risks of recurrence and mortality. Clinicians should use these criteria for appropriate patient referrals, and a multicenter trial could provide accurate classifications.","BackgroundB7-H3 is a cell surface immunomodulatory glycoprotein overexpressed in prostate cancers (PC). Understanding its longitudinal expression at emergence of castration-resistance, and association with tumour genomics, is critical to the development of and patient selection for B7-H3 targeted therapies.ObjectiveTo characterize B7-H3 expression in same-patient, castration-sensitive PC (CSPC) and castration-resistant PC (CRPC) biopsies, associating this with PC genomics, and to evaluate the antitumour activity of an anti-B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in human CRPC in vitro and in vivo.Design, setting, and participantsWe performed IHC and next generation sequencing on a cohort of 98 clinically annotated, CRPC biopsies, among which 72 patients had CSPC biopsies for analyses. We analysed two CRPC transcriptome and exome datasets. PC organoids (PDX-Os) were derived from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) generated from human CRPC biopsies.Outcome measurementsWe evaluated B7-H3 mRNA expression in relation to a panel of 770 immune-related genes; compared B7-H3 protein expression between same-patient CSPC and CRPC biopsies; determined associations with PC genomic alterations; evaluated the antitumour activity of DS-7300a, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor payload anti-B7-H3 ADC, in human PC cell lines, organoids and xenografts of different histologies, B7-H3 expressions, and genomics.Results and limitationsB7-H3 was one of the most highly expressed immunomodulatory genes in CRPCs. Most CSPCs (97%) and CRPCs (93%) expressed B7-H3 and conversion from B7-H3 positive to negative, or vice versa, during progression from CSPC to CRPC was rare. B7-H3 is overexpressed in tumours with defective DNA repair (DDR) gene (ATM, BRCA1/2) alterations compared to tumours without DDR gene alteration. DS7300a had antitumour activity against B7-H3 expressing human PC models including cell lines, PDX-Os and PDXs of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine histology.ConclusionsB7-H3 is overexpressed in the majority of PCs, especially DDR defective tumours. B7-H3 positive CRPC may be targeted with an anti-B7-H3 ADC.Patient summaryB7-H3, a protein expressed on the surface of most lethal PC, and in particular those with specific mutations, can be targeted using drugs that bind B7-H3 and carry potent chemotherapies. These drugs are being evaluated in cancer patients.",1
"Objective:There are significant disparities in outcomes among Hispanic patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recent studies have demonstrated favorable outcomes of pegaspargase-containing ALL regimens (PEG-CAR) in young adults however, outcomes in Hispanic ethnicity continue to be underreported.Methods:We evaluated outcomes of newly diagnosed, adult B-cell ALL Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients consecutively treated with a PEG-CAR or HyperCVAD between January 2011 and November 2022. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) while secondary endpoints included cumulative incidence of relapse and overall survival (OS).Results:Among 105 included patients, 48 (45.7%) were treated with a PEG-CAR and 57 (54.3%) with HyperCVAD. Median age was 38 years (range, 18–75 years), 61% were Hispanic, and 35.2% had poor-genetic risk. Hispanic patients demonstrated significantly worse 5-year EFS with a PEG-CAR compared to that seen with HyperCVAD (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.32–5.04; p = .006) whereas non-Hispanic patients had better outcomes with PIR (52.4% vs. 42.0%). Hispanic ethnicity (p = .015) and male sex (p = .019) were independent predictors for poor OS.Conclusions:Hispanic patients with B-cell ALL had worse EFS with a PEG-CAR as compared with HyperCVAD. Future studies will aim to confirm these findings and establish a tailored treatment approach for this high-risk population.","AimsNext generation sequencing (NGS) on tumour tissue is integral to the delivery of personalised medicine and targeted therapy. NGS on liquid biopsy, a much less invasive technology, is an emerging clinical tool that has rapidly expanded clinical utility. Gene mutations in cell-free total nucleic acids (cfTNA) circulating in the blood are representative of whole tumour biology and can reveal different mutations from different tumour sites, thus addressing tumour heterogeneity challenges.MethodsThe novel Ion Torrent Genexus NGS system with automated sample preparation, onboard library preparation, templating, sequencing, data analysis and Oncomine Reporter software was used. cfTNA extracted from plasma was verified with the targeted pan-cancer (~50 genes) Oncomine Precision Assay (OPA). Assessment criteria included analytical sensitivity, specificity, limits of detection (LOD), accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility and the establishment of performance metrics.ResultsAn ISO 15189 accredited, minimally invasive cfTNA NGS diagnostic service has been implemented. High sensitivity (>83%) and specificity between plasma and tissue were observed. A sequencing LOD of 1.2% was achieved when the depth of coverage was >22 000×. A reduction (>68%) in turnaround time (TAT) of liquid biopsy results was achieved: 5 days TAT for in-house analysis from sample receipt to a final report issued to oncologists as compared with >15 days from reference laboratories.ConclusionTumour-derived somatic variants can now be reliably assessed from plasma to provide minimally invasive tumour profiling. Successful implementation of this accredited service resulted in: Appropriate molecular profiling of patients where tumour tissue is unavailable or inaccessible. Rapid TAT of plasma NGS results.",0
"ResumenIntroducción:el trasplante de células progenitoras hematopoyéticas (TCPH) es una terapia que ofrece potencial curación de neoplasias hematológicas. Una limitante es que solo 25% de los pacientes tendrán un donante idéntico. El uso de donantes haploidénticos permite que el 95% de los pacientes tengan donador. La experiencia en México con TCPH haploidéntico es limitada. En 2018 se inició el Programa de Trasplantes Haploidénticos en el Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI.Objetivo:comparar la supervivencia global de los pacientes sometidos a TCPH con donante idéntico y haploidéntico en el Hospital de Especialidades.Material y métodos:se hizo un estudio tipo observacional, retrospectivo, en pacientes sometidos a TCPH en el Hospital de Especialidades, de enero de 2018 a diciembre de 2022. Se incluyeron todos los pacientes trasplantados. Se realizó un análisis de supervivencia global por curvas de Kaplan-Meier. Se consideró un nivel de significación de p < 0.05.Resultados:se analizaron 109 pacientes sometidos a TCPH alogénico, 34% de ellos tuvieron un donante haploidéntico. No hubo diferencias en la supervivencia. El grupo haploidéntico presentó mayor reactivación de citomegalovirus y menor enfermedad del injerto en contra del hospedero (EICH) crónica.Conclusiones:no se encontraron diferencias en la supervivencia en ambos grupos, por lo que el trasplante haploidéntico es una opción de tratamiento en los pacientes que no cuentan con donante idéntico en nuestra institución.","BackgroundCutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) has the worst prognosis among skin cancers, especially metastatic CMM. Predicting its prognosis accurately could direct clinical decisions.MethodsThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was screened to collect CMM patients’ data. According to diagnosed time, patients were subdivided into three cohorts, train cohort (diagnosed between 2010 and 2013), validation cohort (diagnosed in 2014), and test cohort (diagnosed in 2015). Train cohort was used to train deep learning survival model for cutaneous malignant melanoma (DeepCMM). DeepCMM was then evaluated in train cohort and validation cohort internally, and validated in test cohort externally.ResultsDeepCMM showed 0.8270 (95% CI, confidence interval, CI 0.8260–0.8280) as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in train cohort, 0.8274 (95% CI 0.8286–0.8298) AUC in validation cohort, and 0.8303 (95% CI 0.8289–0.8316) AUC in test cohort. Then DeepCMM was packaged into a Windows 64-bit software for doctors to use.ConclusionDeep learning survival model for cutaneous malignant melanoma (DeepCMM) can offer a reliable prediction on cutaneous malignant melanoma patients’ overall survival.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05421-7.",1
"SUMMARYVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are two main groups of drugs for targeted treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Inhibition of angiogenesis and other growth pathways that are pivotal for tumor progression lead to significant improvement of survival in patients with mRCC. The main aim of this study was to compare the effects of temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) and interferon alpha-2a (IFN-alpha-2a) on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with T3 stage mRCC who developed lung metastasis in the first two years after radical nephrectomy. A total of 60 patients diagnosed with T3 stage renal cancer who developed metastases in the lungs within two years after radical nephrectomy were included in a prospective study conducted at the Department for Urology, Clinical Center of Vojvodina and partially retrospective study at the Oncology Institute in Sremska Kamenica. Patients were divided into two groups consisting of 30 patients according to treatment with temsirolimus or IFN-alpha. During the first year of treatment, OS of patients treated with temsirolimus was 23.33%, whereas in patients treated with IFN-alpha it was 16.67%. Median survival in patients treated with temsirolimus was 9.3 months, whereas in patients treated with IFN-alpha it was 6.9 months, yielding a statistically significant difference (p=0.028). Patients treated with temsirolimus showed a statistically significantly longer median PFS compared to patients treated with IFN-alpha (p<0.0085). In conclusion, temsirolimus therapy had a significantly positive effect on survival in patients with mRCC. Patients treated with temsirolimus showed significantly longer median survival and median PFS compared to patients treated with IFN-alpha.","DNA guanine (G)-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique secondary structures formed by two or more stacked G-tetrads in G-rich DNA sequences. These structures have been found to play a crucial role in highly transcribed genes, especially in cancer-related oncogenes, making them attractive targets for cancer therapeutics. Significantly, targeting oncogene promoter G4 structures has emerged as a promising strategy to address the challenge of undruggable and drug-resistant proteins, such as MYC, BCL2, KRAS, and EGFR. Natural products have long been an important source of drug discovery, particularly in the fields of cancer and infectious diseases. Noteworthy progress has recently been made in the discovery of naturally occurring DNA G4-targeting drugs. Numerous DNA G4s, such as MYC-G4, BCL2-G4, KRAS-G4, PDGFR-β-G4, VEGF-G4, and telomeric-G4, have been identified as potential targets of natural products, including berberine, telomestatin, quindoline, sanguinarine, isaindigotone, and many others. Herein, we summarize and evaluate recent advancements in natural and nature-derived DNA G4 binders, focusing on understanding the structural recognition of DNA G4s by small molecules derived from nature. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with developing drugs that target DNA G4s.",0
"The “FLASH effect” is an increased therapeutic index, that is, reduced normal tissue toxicity for a given degree of anti-cancer efficacy, produced by ultra-rapid irradiation delivered on time scales orders of magnitude shorter than currently conventional in the clinic for the same doses. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous preclinical in vivo tumor and normal tissue models. While the underlying biological mechanism(s) remain to be elucidated, a path to clinical implementation of FLASH can be paved by addressing several critical translational questions. Technological questions pertinent to each beam type (for example, electron, proton, photon) also dictate the logical progression of experimentation required to move forward in safe and decisive clinical trials. Here we review the available preclinical data pertaining to these questions and how they may inform strategies for FLASH cancer therapy clinical trials.","AbstractClinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have benefited many cancer patients but failed in a number of tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. The main obstacle for ICI efficacy in GBM is the continuously evolving tumor microenvironment (TME), in which antitumor immunity is inhibited or eluded by tumor-secreted factors. Accumulation and reprogramming of myeloid cells (GAMs) creates a “cold” immunosuppressive TME with a poor infiltration and exhaustion of effector T cells. We employ Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) with 40 protein markers along with spatial transcriptomics and immunophenotyping to dissect identities and functionalities of immune cells (CD45+) in experimental GL261 gliomas. The results revealed identities of immune cells instrumental for creating the immunosuppressive milieu and cell-cell communication networks. We have developed a designer RGD peptide that blocks the reprogramming of GAMs by targeting tumor-GAMs interactions. We demonstrate that RGD efficiently blocks microglia-dependent invasion of murine and human glioma cells in vitro. We explored if the intratumorally delivered RGD can revert tumor-induced changes in the TME of experimental gliomas and improve anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. While RGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in vivo, it prevented reprogramming of myeloid cells into protumoral GAMs and led to the normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining RGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, increase in percentages of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of GAMs were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME which resulted in boosting immunotherapy responses. Intratumorally delivered RGD modified in the same way functionalities of GAMs in the TME of human U87MG gliomas in nude mice. Our results demonstrate that the integrin blockade combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors reinvigorates both innate and adaptive antitumor immunity. The results pave the way to improve responses to immunotherapy in GBM and other cancers.",0
"Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) based liquid kidney biopsies have the potential to detect the chances of kidney transplant rejection. Several studies have found that dd-cfDNA can be used to determine the risk of kidney transplant rejection and may correlate with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A high concentration of dd-cfDNA in the body fluids may indicate possible transplant rejection since dd-cfDNA is released as a result of apoptotic and necrotic processes initiated by the recipient’s immune system. dd-cfDNA assays have advantages over conventional biopsies since they are noninvasive, and therefore, have the potential to provide a safe and reliable biomarker. Different dd-cfDNA levels have been reported above a number of cutoff thresholds: ABMR at 2.45% and TCMR at 1.3%, compared with 0.44% in healthy patients; and eGFR at 2.5%, a decrease of 25% compared with healthy patients. These results indicate the levels of dd-cfDNA that may be used to signal possible kidney rejection. dd-cfDNA assay is a rapid technique, making it particularly useful in emergencies, and further research into its use in the study of kidney rejection should prove beneficial.","BackgroundBladder cancer (BLCA) is a prevalent urological tumor with high morbidity and mortality. However, BLCA treatment remains challenging due to a lack of effective biomarkers. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), as active participants in tumor progression are involved in multiple biological regulatory mechanisms, and cuproptosis-related genes participate in the development of cancer. It is important to discover cuproptosis- related lncRNAs for BLCA diagnosis and treatment.MethodsA predictive signature was constructed based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses of the 9 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs. Samples were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group based on their median risk scores to explore their prognosis.ResultsThis signature is well predictive, as evidenced by the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) and K-M curves. Based on the nomogram, we were able to visually forecast the survival rates of patients with BLCA at 1-, 3-, and 5-year, and the calibration plots displayed that the actual results were well matched with the predicted 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. Furthermore, BLCA patients in the high-risk group had a higher Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score and lower TMB. Finally, we investigated the response of antitumor drugs for BLCA patients in different risk groups, and a statistically significant difference was observed in the sensitivity of those drugs between low- and the high-risk groups.ConclusionAccording to the 9 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs, we constructed a signature which can be served as a promising prognostic biomarker for BLCA patients.",1
"Adverse effects of immunotherapeutic treatments like atezolizumab remain largely unknown due to limited experience. We present a 65-year-old man with sudden dyspnea and other symptoms, implicating immunotherapy. Prompt intervention and suspension were crucial. This study identifies a novel unreported adverse effect—bilateral vocal cord and velopalatine paralysis—associated with atezolizumab use.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a new and successful treatment for otherwise refractory malignancies but despite the growing number of applications, this form of treatment is still associated with significant toxicity. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) in particular are common and dangerous side effects. This report is about two patients who received CAR‑T cell therapy and subsequently developed ICANS. This was successfully treated. During CAR‑T cell therapy, a blood marker, S100, was monitored daily. It correlated with the occurrence and progression of ICANS.",0
"AbstractBackgroundThis study validates MRI-based tumor habitats in predicting time-to-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and progression sites in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma patients.MethodsSeventy-nine patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2020 and June 2022. MRI, including diffusion-weighted and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, were obtained immediately postoperation and at three serial timepoints. Voxels from cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were grouped into three habitats (hypervascular cellular, hypovascular cellular, and nonviable tissue) using k-means clustering. Predefined cutoffs for increases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitat were applied to calculate the habitat risk score. Associations between spatiotemporal habitats, habitat risk score, TTP, and OS were investigated using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Habitat risk score was compared to tumor volume using time-dependent receiver operating characteristics analysis. Progression sites were matched with spatial habitats.ResultsIncreases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitats and habitat risk scores were associated with shorter TTP and OS (all P < .05). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk scores 1 and 2 independently predicted TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 4.14; P = .03, HR, 4.51; P = .001 and HR, 10.02; P < .001, respectively). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk score 2 independently predicted OS (HR, 4.01, P = .003; and HR, 3.27, P < .001, respectively). Habitat risk score outperformed tumor volume in predicting TTP (12-month AUC, 0.762 vs. 0.646, P = .048). Hypovascular cellular habitat predicted progression sites (mean Dice index: 0.31).ConclusionsMultiparametric physiologic MRI-based spatiotemporal tumor habitats and habitat risk scores are useful biomarkers for early tumor progression and outcomes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients.","Heterotrimeric extracellular matrix proteins laminins are mostly deposited at basal membranes and are important in repair and neoplasia. Here, we localize laminin beta 2 (LAMB2) at the sites of blood–brain barrier (BBB). Microvasculature (MV) of normal brain is endowed with complete LAMB2 coverage. In contrast, its cognate protein laminin beta 1 (LAMB1) is absent in MV of normal brain but emerges at the sprouting tip of a growing vessels. Similarly, vascular proliferation in high-grade gliomas (HGG) is accompanied by marked overexpression of LAMB1, whereas LAMB2 shows deficient deposition. We find that many brain pathologies with presence of post-gadolinium enhancement (PGE) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show disruption of LAMB2 vascular ensheathment. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in HGG blocks angiogenesis, suppresses PGE in HGG, prevents expression of LAMB1, and restores LAMB2 vascular coverage. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases shows that in quiescent brain LAMB2 is predominantly expressed by BBB-associated pericytes (PCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), whereas neither cell types produce LAMB1. In contrast, in HGG, both LAMB1 and 2 are overexpressed by endothelial precursor cells, a phenotypically unique immature group, specific to proliferating hyperplastic MV.",1
"PurposeTo investigate the prognostic value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).MethodsThe medical records of HCC patients treated with SBRT between 2008 and 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. The NLR and PLR were calculated from the serum complete blood count before and after SBRT, and the prognostic values of the NLR and PLR for the treatment outcomes were evaluated.ResultsThirty-nine patients with 49 HCC lesions were included. After a median follow-up of 26.8 months (range, 8.4-80.0 months), three-year local control, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 97.4%, 78.3%, and 35.2%, respectively. Both NLR and PLR increased significantly after SBRT and decreased slowly to the pre-SBRT value at 6 months. Univariable analysis showed that gross tumor volume (GTV) >14 cc, post-SBRT PLR >90, and PLR change >30 were associated with a poorer OS (p=0.002, p=0.011, and p=0.001, respectively), and the PLR change was significant in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 10.09; 95% CI, 1.15-88.40; p=0.037). For PFS, GTV >14 cc, post-SBRT NLR >2.5 and post-SBRT PLR >90 were predictive of a poorer PFS in univariable analysis (p=0.011, p=0.004 and p=0.041, respectively) and only post-SBRT NLR >2.5 remained significant in multivariable analysis (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.03-5.76; p=0.042, respectively).ConclusionsThe NLR and PLR increased transiently after SBRT, and the post-SBRT NLR and PLR were associated with the clinical outcomes of HCC patients.","N6 methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), has been extensively studied in recent years. Dysregulation of m6A and its associated machinery (including “writers”, “erasers” and “readers”) has been frequently observed in various cancer types, and their dysregulation profiles may serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers. The dysregulated m6A modifiers have been shown to function as oncogenes or tumour suppressors, and play essential roles in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, metabolism, drug resistance, and immune evasion, as well as in cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumour microenvironment, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the dysregulated m6A machinery for cancer treatment. In this review, we illustrate the mechanisms by which m6A modifiers interplay and orchestrate the fate of target RNAs. We also describe the state-of-the-art methodologies for mapping global m6A in cancer epitranscriptomes. We further summarize the recent discoveries regarding the dysregulations of m6A and the associated machinery in cancers and their pathological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms in cancers. Finally, we discuss the findings on m6A related molecules as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancers, as well as the recent development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting oncogenic m6A modifiers and their preclinical results in treating cancers.",0
"PurposeColon cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the intestine. Abnormal Carboxylesterases 3 (CES3) expression had been reported to be correlated to multiple tumor progression. However, the association among CES3 expression and prognostic value and immune effects in colonic adenocarcinoma (COAD) were unclear.Patients and methodsThe transcription and expression data of CES3 and corresponding clinical information was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The CES3 protein expression and the prognostic value were verified based on tissue microarray data. The Cancer immune group Atlas (TCIA), Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm and the GSE78220 immunotherapy cohort were used to forecast immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, a prognostic immune signature was constructed and verified.ResultsCompared with normal colon tissues, the expression of mRNA and protein levels of CES3 were downregulated in tumor tissues. CES3 expression was associated with TIICs. Hihg-CES3 COAD patients had better efficacy of concurrent immunotherapy. CES3-related immune genes (CRIs) were identified and were then used to construct prognostic immune signature and had been successfully verified in GES39582.ConclusionCES3 might be a potential immune-related gene and promising prognostic biomarker in COAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05156-5.","Due to the high toxicity, poor efficacy and resistance associated with current anti-breast cancer drugs, there’s growing interest in natural products (NPs) for their potential anti-cancer properties. Computational modelling of NPs to identify key structural features can aid in developing novel natural inhibitors. In this study, we developed statistically significant QSAR models based on NPs from the NPACT database, which have shown potential anticancer activity against the MCF-7 cancer cell lines. All the developed QSAR models were statistically robust, meeting both internal (R2 = 0.666–0.669, R2adj = 0.657–0.660, Q2Loo = 0.636–0.638) and external (Q2Fn = 0.686–0.714, CCCext = 0.830–0.847) validation criteria. Consequently, they were utilized to virtually screen a series of NPs from the COCONUT database in the search for novel natural inhibitors. Molecular docking studies were conducted on the identified compounds against the human HER2 protein (PDB ID: 3PP0), which is a crucial target in breast cancer. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that compounds 4608 and 2710 achieved the highest docking scores, with CDOCKER interaction energies of -72.67 kcal/mol and − 72.63 kcal/mol respectively. Compounds 4608 and 2710 were identified as the most promising candidates upon performing triplicate 100 ns MD simulation study using the CHARMM36 force field. DFT studies was performed to evaluate their stability and reactivity as potential drug molecules. This research contributes to the development of new natural inhibitors for breast cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00266-5.",0
"AbstractGastric cancer remains a considerable global health burden, with limited treatment options available for advanced cases, especially for superaged patients. Cadonilimab, a first-in-class bi-specific antibody (BsAb), offer a promising immunotherapy approach by targeting PD-1/CTLA-4 simultaneously. Herein, we present a case report of an 85-year-old patient with HER2-negative advanced gastric cancer who received first-line treatment with cadonilimab combined with chemotherapy, but cadonilimab was discontinued due to the observation of immune-related pneumonitis during treatment. Despite these changes, the patient still exhibited a stable disease condition for a year until now. This case report highlights the potential of cadonilimab in the treatment of superaged patients with advanced gastric cancer, while the efficacy and safety of it need to be further evaluated.","AbstractOesophageal cancer (EC) is a malignancy which accounts for a substantial number of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of EC have not been fully elucidated. GSE17351 and GSE20347 data sets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were employed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR) was used to examine hub gene expression. ECA‐109 and TE‐12 cells were transfected using the pcDNA3.1 expression vector encoding GABRP. The cell counting kit‐8 (CCK‐8), cell scratch and Transwell assays were performed to assess the effect of GABRP on EC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT)‐associated protein levels were measured by Western blotting. Subsequently, CFTR was knocked down to verify whether GABRP affected biological events in EC cells by targeting CFTR. Seven hub genes were identified, including GABRP, FLG, ENAH, KLF4, CD24, ABLIM3 and ABLIM1, which all could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for EC. The RT‐qPCR results indicated that the expression levels of GABRP, FLG, KLF4, CD24, ABLIM3 and ABLIM1 were downregulated, whereas the expression level of ENAH was upregulated. In vitro functional assays demonstrated that GABRP overexpression suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of EC cells. Mechanistically, GABRP promoted the expression of CFTR, and CFTR knockdown significantly counteracted the influence of GABRP overexpression on biological events in EC cells. Overexpression of GABRP inhibited EC progression by increasing CFTR expression, which might be a new target for EC treatment.",0
"Background:Axitinib plus pembrolizumab showed superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) versus sunitinib in a randomised phase III trial in patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). We report long-term efficacy and safety of the axitinib/pembrolizumab from the phase I trial (NCT02133742), after 46–55 months from study initiation (data cut-off date, 23rd July 2019).Methods:Fifty-two treatment-naïve patients with advanced RCC were treated with oral axitinib 5 mg twice daily and intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. PFS, duration of response (DoR) and OS were summarised using the Kaplan–Meier method.Results:At a median follow-up of 42.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.1–44.1), median OS was not reached; 38 (73.1%) patients were alive. The probability of being alive at 4 years was 66.8% (95% CI: 49.1–79.5). Median PFS in the overall population was 23.5 months (95% CI: 15.4–30.4). ORR was 73.1%; five patients had complete response. Median DoR was 22.1 months (95% CI: 15.1–34.5). Grade III/IV adverse events (AEs) were reported in 38 (73.1%) patients and 20 (38.5%) discontinued treatment because of AEs: 17 (32.7%) discontinued axitinib, 13 (25.0%) discontinued pembrolizumab, and 10 (19.2%) discontinued both drugs. Common AEs included diarrhoea (84.6%), fatigue (80.8%), hypertension (53.8%), cough (48.1%) and dysphonia (48.1%). There were no new AE terms reported and no treatment-related deaths.Conclusions:In patients with advanced RCC with ~4 years of follow-up, combination axitinib/pembrolizumab continued to demonstrate clinical benefit, with no new safety signals.","PD-L1 is a glycoprotein present on antigen-presenting cells and malignant cells and activates the PD-L1 receptor on cells surfaces, leading to T-cell anergy and death. The objective of this study was to assess PD-L1 tumoral expression in 50 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, define its prognostic value, and investigate its association with 2-year overall survival, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, and a number of other clinicopathological parameters. In a 24-month prospective observational study, involving 50 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients, PD-L1 tumoral expression was evaluated using semiquantitative immunohistochemistry analysis by an experienced pathologist. PD-L1 expression of ≥ 6% of tumor cells was associated with poor survival outcome and determined to be a pertinent clinical cutoff value. PD-L1 expression of ≥ 6% was significantly associated with a number of clinicopathological parameters in our study of 50 patients with OSCC. Pathological nodal staging (P = 0.00), lympho-vascular invasion (P = 0.03), extra-nodal extension (P = 0.04), overall staging (P = 0.01), locoregional recurrence (P = 0.00), and distant metastasis (P = 0.00) all showed statistically significant associations. Our study concluded a significant correlation with decreased 2-year overall survival and 2-year disease free survival by using the Kaplan- Meier survival plot for overall survival (p = 0.02) and (p = 0.0002), respectively. The presence of ≥ 6% PD-L1 (CD274) tumoral expression was found to be significantly associated with 2-year overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRC), distant metastasis (DM), and various clinicopathological parameters. Tumoral PD-L1 was found as a discrete prognostic biomarker which showed significant association with tumor aggressiveness.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDImmunotherapy (IT) has gained increased significance as a systemic therapy option in the management of various types of metastatic cancer, including cases involving brain metastases (BMs). The differential diagnosis of progressive/relapsed BMs and treatment-related changes (TRC) is often based on imaging with amino acid (AA) PET, in addition to standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as this has been established to provide higher diagnostic accuracy. However, diagnostic value of the AA-PET in the context of IT has not been studied so far. In this pilot study we quantified diagnostic accuracy of AA PET in patients with suspected progressive BMs under IT. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis retrospective study included patients with suspected progressive/relapsed BMs on MRI after radiotherapy (RT) between 04/2007 - 01/2023. Only patients with AA PET ≤ 4 weeks prior to surgery/biopsy of BMs were selected. AA PET results were compared with histopathological findings and distinctive features were highlighted. RESULTSOut of 29 patients, 7 were treated with IT (IT+ group). Remaining patients (IT- group) were treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, a combination of both, or obtained no systemic therapy before PET. The groups did not differ regarding age, gender, initial number of BMs or time interval between PET and last RT. In the IT+ group, 6 patients had malignant melanoma and 1 patient urothelial carcinoma as primary tumor. The IT+ patients obtained ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab, sequentially, or in combination. In the IT+ and IT- group, 7 and 21 PET scans were read as suspicious for progressive/relapsed BMs, respectively. The rate of false-positive findings was 5/7 (71.4%) and 3/21 (14.3%), respectively (chi square test, p=0.008). Histopathological analyses revealed an inflammatory reaction with lymphocytic infiltrates in the examined tissue in the IT+ group. CONCLUSIONThere is a significantly higher rate of false-positive AA PET findings in patients with BMs who have been treated with IT. This observation may be explained by an immunologically mediated inflammatory reaction. Further immunological analyses of lymphocytic infiltrates could provide more information.In conclusion, until more data are available, caution should be exercised when diagnosing tumor recurrence using AA PET in patients who have previously received IT.","AbstractBackgroundHormone receptor–positive (HR+) breast cancer responds poorly to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In some settings, radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to mediate immunostimulatory effects and promote ICI sensitivity.MethodsWe investigated whether hypofractionated RT may be successfully combined with ICIs in a mouse model of multifocal, metachronous HR+ mammary carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that focal RT targeting the first detectable (primary) tumor combined with ICIs may generate effective immunity, delaying the development of new lesions.ResultsFocal RT in various doses and fractionations limited primary tumor growth, with an optimum for a 20-Gy × 2 regimen (ablative in approximately 90% of mice). The degree of primary disease control, however, did not necessarily correlate with overall survival extension because of changes in the development of new neoplastic lesions contributing to global tumor burden. Adding a PD-1 blocker to focal RT delivered in a 10-Gy × 3, 20-Gy × 2, or 8-Gy × 6 regimen failed to alter overall survival extension enabled by RT alone. Similar results were obtained with a CTLA4 blocker, an IL-1β inhibitor, and a PD-1 blocker plus recombinant FLT3LG when combined with the 10-Gy × 3 regimen.ConclusionsIn this model of HR+ mammary carcinogenesis, RT to the primary tumor ameliorates overall survival (to an extent based on dose and fractionation). Increasing local control through RT alone or RT plus immunotherapy beyond a hitherto undefined threshold, however, does not necessarily inhibit the development of subsequent nonirradiated neoplasms and hence does not necessarily provide extra overall survival benefits.",0
"As one of the most prevalent malignancies, lung cancer displays considerable biological variability in both molecular and clinical characteristics. Lung cancer is broadly categorized into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the latter being most prevalent. The primary histological subtypes of NSCLC are lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In the present work, we primarily extracted mRNA count data from a publicly accessible database followed by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed mitophagy-related genes (DEMRGs) identification in case of both LUAD and LUSC cohorts. Next, we identified important DEMRGs via clustering approach followed by enrichment, survival, and mutational analyses. Lastly, the finalized prognostic biomarker was validated using wet-lab experimentations. Primarily, we obtained 986 and 1714 DEGs across LUAD and LUSC cohorts. Only 7 DEMRGs from both cohorts had significant membership values as indicated by the clustering analysis. Most significant pathway, Gene Ontology (GO)-biological process (BP), GO-molecular function (MF), GO-cellular compartment (CC) terms were macroautophagy, GTP metabolic process, magnesium ion binding, mitochondrial outer membrane. Among all, only TDRKH reported significant overall survival (OS) and 14% amplification across LUAD patients. Lastly, we validated TDRKH via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In conclusion, our findings advocate for the exploration of TDRKH and their genetic alterations in precision oncology therapeutic approaches for LUAD, emphasizing the potential for target-driven therapy and early diagnostics.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-024-04127-y.","Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3) is a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein family expressed in the extracellular matrix closely associated with the development and occurrence of various malignant tumors; yet, its function in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is still poorly understood. The following study investigated the progress and mechanism of HAPLN3 on ccRCC using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments. In order to determine whether HAPLN3 is differentially expressed in ccRCC, we analyzed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE40435 and further validated them in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Simultaneously, the TCGA dataset was utilized to study the relationship between HAPLN3 expression and the progression of ccRCC and its prognostic value in ccRCC. Gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore HAPLN3-related signaling pathways in ccRCC. The TIMER database investigates the link for both HAPLN3 and immune cell infiltration. Different ccRCC cell lines the role of HAPLN3 on cell biological behavior in vitro. HAPLN3 was increased in ccRCC, and its high expression was related to the patients' survival rates and clinical characteristics. GSEA showed that HAPLN3 is mainly enriched in proliferative and metastatic pathways. In addition, HAPLN3 was an independently associated significant predictor in patients with ccRCC. Functional experiments demonstrated that HAPLN3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. To sum up, our data suggest that HAPLN3 may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.",1
"ABSTRACTPoly(amino acid) nanomedicines hold significant promise for cancer therapy. However, their clinical translation has not matched the extensive efforts of scientists or the burgeoning body of research. The therapeutic outcomes with most nanomedicines often fall short of the promising results observed in animal experiments. This review explores the challenges faced in cancer therapy using poly(amino acid) nanomedicines, particularly addressing the controversies surrounding the enhanced permeability and retention effect and the lack of methods for controlled and reproducible mass production of poly(amino acid) nanomedicines. Furthermore, this review examines the opportunities emerging in this field due to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence.","Objective:This study aimed to assess reporting quality of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the head and neck oncology literature using the TRIPOD-AI criteria.Data Sources:A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, incorporating search terms related to “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “deep learning,” “neural network,” and various head and neck neoplasms.Review Methods:Two independent reviewers analyzed each published study for adherence to the 65-point TRIPOD-AI criteria. Items were classified as “Yes,” “No,” or “NA” for each publication. The proportion of studies satisfying each TRIPOD-AI criterion was calculated. Additionally, the evidence level for each study was evaluated independently by two reviewers using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence. Discrepancies were reconciled through discussion until consensus was reached.Results:The study highlights the need for improvements in ML algorithm reporting in head and neck oncology. This includes more comprehensive descriptions of datasets, standardization of model performance reporting, and increased sharing of ML models, data, and code with the research community. Adoption of TRIPOD-AI is necessary for achieving standardized ML research reporting in head and neck oncology.Conclusion:Current reporting of ML algorithms hinders clinical application, reproducibility, and understanding of the data used for model training. To overcome these limitations and improve patient and clinician trust, ML developers should provide open access to models, code, and source data, fostering iterative progress through community critique, thus enhancing model accuracy and mitigating biases.",1
"BackgroundThe advantages of radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) depend on the radiation sensitivity of the patient. Here, we established and verified radiological factor-related gene signature and built a prognostic risk model to predict whether radiotherapy would be beneficial.MethodsData from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus, and RadAtlas databases were subjected to LASSO regression, univariate COX regression, and multivariate COX regression analyses to integrate genomic and clinical information from patients with HNSCC. HNSCC radiation-related prognostic genes were identified, and patients classified into high- and low-risk groups, based on risk scores. Variations in radiation sensitivity according to immunological microenvironment, functional pathways, and immunotherapy response were investigated. Finally, the expression of HNSCC radiation-related genes was verified by qRT-PCR.ResultsWe built a clinical risk prediction model comprising a 15-gene signature and used it to divide patients into two groups based on their susceptibility to radiation: radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant. Overall survival was significantly greater in the radiation-sensitive than the radiation-resistant group. Further, our model was an independent predictor of radiotherapy response, outperforming other clinical parameters, and could be combined with tumor mutational burden, to identify the target population with good predictive value for prognosis at 1, 2, and 3 years. Additionally, the radiation-resistant group was more vulnerable to low levels of immune infiltration, which are significantly associated with DNA damage repair, hypoxia, and cell cycle regulation. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion scores also suggested that the resistant group would respond less favorably to immunotherapy.ConclusionsOur prognostic model based on a radiation-related gene signature has potential for application as a tool for risk stratification of radiation therapy for patients with HNSCC, helping to identify candidates for radiation therapy and overcome radiation resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05304-x.","With more treatment options in oncology lead to better outcomes and more favorable side effect profiles, patients are living longer — with higher quality of life — than ever, with a growing survivor population.

"AbstractBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with severe immune-related adverse events (s-irAEs) that result in hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, treatment discontinuation, or death. This study examined the impact of s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies on clinical outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsData were derived from ConcertAI Patient360 NSCLC, a US-based electronic medical record database, between January 2012 and May 2021. Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC and received ICI-containing therapy. s-irAEs and management actions were abstracted from unstructured EHR data from ICI initiation through the earliest of 100 days after ICI discontinuation, start of a non-ICI-containing regimen, loss to follow up, end of study period, or death. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies, and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS).ResultsThe study included 3211 patients. Median (IQR) age was 67 (60-73) years, and 44.9% were female. Most patients (61.6%) initiated ICIs as first-line therapy; half (50.1%) initiated ICIs as monotherapy, with nivolumab monotherapy (29.5%) as the most common initial ICI-containing regimen in any line. Overall, 8.6% of patients experienced s-irAEs, most often diarrhea (3.5%), pneumonitis (1.4%), and rash (1.3%). Among patients who experienced at least one s-irAEs, over half (57.4%) were hospitalized, and 71.8% were treated with corticosteroids, any time after the occurrence of their first s-irAEs. Median rwPFS was 4.9 (95%CI, 4.6-5.2) months, and median rwOS was 13.6 (12.6-14.7) months from ICI initiation. rwPFS and rwOS were comparable between patients with s-irAEs vs patients without s-irAEs when s-irAEs were first managed with anti-cancer treatment interruptions. Patients with s-irAEs had a 53% (22.3%-91.4%) higher risk of death than patients without s-irAEs when s-irAEs initially required corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants, and a 61% (37.9%-87.9%) higher risk of death when s-irAEs first required hospitalization or ED admission.ConclusionThe impact of s-irAEs on clinical outcomes may depend on the initial intervention required to manage the adverse event. s-irAEs were associated with worse outcomes when they initially required hospital/ED admission, corticosteroids, or other immunosuppression.","AbstractBackgroundThis investigator-initiated phase II trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (CaboNivoIpi) in previously treated patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.MethodsEligible patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who progressed on 1 prior line of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy received a 2-week run-in of cabozantinib monotherapy followed by CaboNivoIpi for 4 cycles (cycle length = 6 weeks), followed by cabozantinib plus nivolumab (cycle length = 4 weeks) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) within the first 6 months of treatment. A Simon optimal 2-stage design allowed for an interim analysis after accrual of 10 evaluable patients. At least 5 responses were needed to proceed to stage 2.ResultsAmong 11 patients enrolled, the median age was 69 years. Prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapies included lenvatinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib plus everolimus. Median follow-up was 13.4 months. Among 10 evaluable patients, ORR within the first 6 months of treatment was 10% (1 partial response). Median progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI, 3.0–not reached) and median overall survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 4.6–not reached). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were noted in 55% (6/11) and grade 5 AEs in 18% (2/11) of patients. The most common treatment-related AE was hypertension. The study did not reach its prespecified efficacy threshold.ConclusionCaboNivoIpi had low ORRs and a high rate of grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs.Clinical Trial RegistrationNCT03914300",1
"Purpose:Recent studies have shown that severe depletion of the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) induced by radiation therapy (RT) has been associated with poor overall survival of patients with many solid tumors. In this paper, we aimed to predict radiation-induced lymphocyte depletion in esophageal cancer patients during the course of RT based on patient characteristics and dosimetric features.Methods:We proposed a hybrid deep learning model in a stacked structure to predict a trend toward ALC depletion based on the clinical information before or at the early stages of RT treatment. The proposed model consisted of four channels, one channel based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network and three channels based on neural networks, to process four categories of features followed by a dense layer to integrate the outputs of four channels and predict the weekly ALC values. Moreover, a discriminative kernel was developed to extract temporal features and assign different weights to each part of the input sequence that enabled the model to focus on the most relevant parts. The proposed model was trained and tested on a dataset of 860 esophageal cancer patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy.Results:The performance of the proposed model was evaluated based on several important prediction metrics and compared to other commonly used prediction models. The results showed that the proposed model outperformed off-the-shelf prediction methods with at least a 30% reduction in the mean squared error (MSE) of weekly ALC predictions based on pretreatment data. Moreover, using an extended model based on augmented first-week treatment, data reduced the MSE of predictions by 70% compared to the model based on the pretreatment data.Conclusions:In conclusion, our model performed well in predicting radiation-induced lymphocyte depletion for RT treatment planning. The ability to predict ALC will enable physicians to evaluate individual RT treatment plans for lymphopenia risk and to identify patients at high risk who would benefit from modified treatment approaches.","BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.",0
"PurposePostoperative adjuvant trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is regarded as a common strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients at a high risk of recurrence. However, there are currently no clinically available biomarkers to predict adjuvant TACE response. Vessels that encapsulate tumor clusters (VETC) can be used as an independent predictor of HCC prognosis. In this study, we aimed to explore whether the VETC pattern could predict adjuvant TACE benefit.MethodsVascular pattern and HIF-1α expression were detected in immunohistochemistry. The survival benefit of adjuvant TACE therapy for patients with or without VETC pattern (VETC+ /VETC−) was evaluated.ResultsThe adjuvant TACE therapy obviously improved the TTR and OS in VETC+ patients, while adjuvant TACE therapy could not benefit from VETC− patients. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that adjuvant TACE therapy significantly improved the TTR and OS in VETC+ patients, but not in VETC- patients. In addition, the VETC+ , but not VETC− , patients could benefit from adjuvant TACE therapy in patients with high-risk factors of vascular invasion, larger tumor or multiple tumor. The mechanistic investigations revealed that the favorable efficacy of adjuvant TACE on VETC+ patients, but not VETC− ones, may be not due to the activation of HIF-1α pathway.ConclusionThe VETC pattern may represent a novel and reliable factor for selecting HCC patients who may benefit from adjuvant TACE therapy, and the combination of VETC pattern and tumor characteristics may help stratify patients’ outcomes and responses to adjuvant TACE therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04323-4.","PurposeCell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma enables rapid and repeat testing of actionable mutations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an attractive platform for multiplex sequencing capabilities compared to traditional methods such as PCR. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of the NGS-based ctDNA assay and to identify the genomic alteration profile of ctDNA in real-world Chinese non-small cell lung (NSCLC) patients.MethodsIn total, 294 Chinese patients with pathological diagnosis of Phase III-IV NSCLC were enrolled. 3–4 mL peripheral blood was collected and NGS-based analysis was carried out using a 20-gene panel. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA NGS-based assay was validated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).ResultsWe have tested 570 sites from 286 samples using ddPCR, which included 108 positive sites and 462 negative sites from NGS results, and the concordance rate was 99.8% (418/419) for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 96.7% (146/151) for insertions and deletions (InDels). The most frequent genes were TP53 (32%), EGFR (31.97%), KRAS (6.46%), PIK3CA (4.76%), and MET (4.08%). Exon 19 deletion (19del) was the most common alteration in EGFR and G12C was the most common alteration in KRAS. Furthermore, the detection rate of TP53 was higher in the male and patients with squamous cell carcinoma. We also found the prevalence of TP53 in L858R was higher than in 19del (61.29% vs. 40%; p = 0.1115).ConclusionThe results indicate that the results of NGS-based ctDNA assay are highly consistent with ddPCR. In Chinese NSCLC patients, TP53 mutation was more frequently associated with male and squamous cell carcinoma. The prevalence of concomitant mutations in L858R may be different from that in 19del.",0
"ABSTRACTAsparagine synthetase (ASNS) catalyzes the biosynthesis of asparagine from aspartate and glutamine. Cells lacking ASNS, however, are auxotrophic for asparagine. Use of L-asparaginase to promote asparagine starvation in solid tumors with low ASNS levels, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is a rationale treatment strategy. However, tumor cell resistance to L-asparaginase has limited its clinical utility. Our preclinical studies show that RAS/MAPK signaling circumvents L-asparaginase-induced tumor killing, but L-asparaginase and MEK inhibition potentiated tumor killing; suggesting that this combination may provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients with PDAC. This Phase I trial (NCT05034627) will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib, in combination with pegylated L-asparaginase, L calaspargase pegol-mknl, in patients with locally-advanced or metastatic PDAC.","Cancer metabolic reprogramming has been considered an emerging hallmark in tumorigenesis and the antitumor immune response. Like cancer cells, immune cells within the tumor microenvironment or premetastatic niche also undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming, which profoundly impacts anti-tumor immune responses. Numerous evidence has illuminated that immunosuppressive TME and the metabolites released by tumor cells, including lactic acid, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), fatty acids (FAs), cholesterol, D-2-Hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), adenosine (ADO), and kynurenine (KYN) can contribute to CD8+ T cell dysfunction. Dynamic alterations of these metabolites between tumor cells and immune cells can similarly initiate metabolic competition in the TME, leading to nutrient deprivation and subsequent microenvironmental acidosis, which impedes immune response. This review summarizes the new landscape beyond the classical metabolic pathways in tumor cells, highlighting the pivotal role of metabolic disturbance in the immunosuppressive microenvironment, especially how nutrient deprivation in TME leads to metabolic reprogramming of CD8+ T cells. Likewise, it emphasizes the current therapeutic targets or strategies related to tumor metabolism and immune response, providing therapeutic benefits for tumor immunotherapy and drug development in the future.

"ObjectiveImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been validated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, there exists no evidence regarding NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, experiencing EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment failure. We collected clinical information from real world and conducted a time series-based meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations and experienced EGFR-TKIs resistance.MethodsTwenty-two NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations after TKI resistance were included from two hospitals. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literature published until December 31, 2021. Endpoint outcomes included mortality and progression-free survival (PFS) at different times of follow-up.ResultsIn total, 22 patients showed that the median PFS was 5.6 months (range 2.0–9.0 months). According to treatment strategies, the median PFS was 2.4 months (range 2.0–5.3 months) in the ICI monotherapy group and 5.9 months (range 2.8–9.0 months) in the ICI combined Chemotherapy group. Additionally, sixteen studies, including 5 trials, 10 controlled cohorts and 1 real-world study, were assessed, involving a total of ICI-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation after TKI failure. The 6-month survival and PFS rate were 0.82 (95% CI 0.36–0.97) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.34–0.74), respectively. ICI combined chemotherapy showed the best survival outcome among these groups, as demonstrated by the 12-month survival rate and PFS. No new safety signals were identified with the combination therapy. The frequency of treatment-related adverse events was similar to that in previously reported studies of chemotherapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors.ConclusionsThe addition of ICIs plus chemotherapy may significantly improve progression-free survival among patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who EGFR-TKIs resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04176-x.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been explored as first-line treatment in various types of previously untreatable malignancies, while limited evidence is available on the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients undergoing immunotherapy. We systematically reviewed data concerning challenges of hepatic adverse events including HBV reactivation and hepatitis in patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing immunotherapy.MethodsA systematic search was conducted in Medline, web of science, Embase and Cochrane library up to May 31, 2022. Studies reporting the safety profile of ICIs in patients with HBV infection were eligible. Meta-analyses were conducted to generate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsA total of 13 studies including 2561 patients were included for meta-analysis. The overall incidence rates of HBV reactivation in patients with chronic HBV infection and past HBV infection were 1.0% (95% CI 0–3%) and 0% (95% CI 0–0%), respectively. Among patients with chronic HBV infection, the incidence rates of HBV reactivation were 1.0% (95% CI 0–2%) and 10.0% (95% CI 4–18%) for patients with and without antiviral prophylaxis, respectively. Patients with chronic HBV infection were at a higher risk of HBV reactivation compared with those with past HBV infection [OR = 8.69, 95% CI (2.16–34.99)]. Antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of HBV reactivation [OR = 0.12, 95% CI (0.02–0.67)] and HBV-associated hepatitis [OR = 0.05, 95% CI (0.01–0.28)] in patients with chronic HBV infection.ConclusionsProphylactic antiviral therapy should be administered to patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing anticancer immunotherapy. Patients with past HBV infection are at lower risk of HBV reactivation compared with those with chronic HBV infection, they could be initiated with antiviral prophylaxis or monitored with the intent of on-demand antiviral therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04133-8.",1
"BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological cancer driven on by aberrant myeloid precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. A prognostic model was created in this study to direct therapeutic care.MethodsDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were investigated using the RNA-seq data from the TCGA-LAML and GTEx. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) examines the genes involved in cancer. Find the intersection genes and construct the PPI network to discover hub genes and remove prognosis-related genes. A nomogram was produced for predicting the prognosis of AML patients using the risk prognosis model that was constructed using COX and Lasso regression analysis. GO, KEGG, and ssGSEA analysis were used to look into its biological function. TIDE score predicts immunotherapy response.ResultsDifferentially expressed gene analysis revealed 1004 genes, WGCNA analysis revealed 19,575 tumor-related genes, and 941 intersection genes in total. Twelve prognostic genes were found using the PPI network and prognostic analysis. To build a risk rating model, RPS3A and PSMA2 were examined using COX and Lasso regression analysis. The risk score was used to divide the patients into two groups, and Kaplan–Meier analysis indicated that the two groups had different overall survival rates. Univariate and multivariate COX studies demonstrated that risk score is an independent prognostic factor. According to the TIDE study, the immunotherapy response was better in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group.ConclusionsWe eventually selected out two molecules to construct prediction models that might be used as biomarkers for predicting AML immunotherapy and prognosis.","PurposeClear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are the most common form of renal cancer in the world. The loss of extracellular matrix (ECM) stimulates cell apoptosis, known as anoikis. A resistance to anoikis in cancer cells is believed to contribute to tumor malignancy, particularly metastasis; however, the potential influence of anoikis on the prognosis of ccRCC patients is not fully understood.MethodsIn this study, anoikis-related genes (ARGs) with discrepant expression were selected from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The anoikis-related gene signature (ARS) was built using a combination of the univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses. ARS was also evaluated for their prognostic value. We explored the tumor microenvironment and enrichment pathways between different clusters of ccRCC. We also examined differences in clinical characteristics, immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity between the high- and low-risk sets. In addition, we utilized three external databases and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to validate the expression and prognosis of ARGs.ResultsEight ARGs (PLAUR, HMCN1, CDKN2A, BID, GLI2, PLG, PRKCQ and IRF6) were identified as anoikis-related prognostic factors. According to Kaplan–Meier (KM) analysis, ccRCC patients with high-risk ARGs have a worse prognosis. The risk score was found to be a significant independent prognostic indicator. According to tumor microenvironment (TME) scores, stromal score, immune score, and estimated score of the high-risk group were superior to those of the low-risk group. There were significant differences between the two groups regarding the amount of infiltrated immune cells, immune checkpoint expression as well as drug sensitivity. A nomogram was constructed using ccRCC clinical features and risk scores. The signature and the nomogram both performed well in predicting overall survival (OS) for ccRCC patients. According to a decision curve analysis (DCA), clinical treatment options for patients with ccRCC could be improved using this model.ConclusionThe results of validation from external databases and qRT-PCR were basically agreement with findings in TCGA and GEO databases. The ARS serving as biomarkers may provide an important reference for individual therapy of ccRCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05012-6.",1
"PurposeLung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is an aggressive subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in the development of LUSC. We aim to identify potential therapeutic targets and a TME-related prognostic signature and for LUSC.MethodsTME-related genes were obtained from TCGA-LUSC dataset. LUSC samples were clustered by the non-negative matrix clustering algorithm (NMF). The prognostic signature was constructed through univariate Cox regression, multivariate Cox regression, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out to explore the enrichment pathways.ResultsThis study constructed a prognostic signature which contained 12 genes: HHIPL2, PLK4, SLC6A4, LSM1, TSLP, P4HA1, AMH, CLDN5, NRTN, CDH2, PTGIS, and STX1A. Patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the median risk score of this signature. Compared with low-risk group patients, patients in high-risk group patients had poorer overall survival, which demonstrated this signature was an independent prognostic factor. Besides, correlation analysis and GSEA results revealed that genes of this signature were correlated with immune cells and drug response.ConclusionOur novel signature based on 12 TME-related genes might be applied as an independent prognostic indicator. Importantly, the signature could be a promising biomarker and accurately predict the prognosis of LUSC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05042-0.","In recent years, as more and more lung-cancer patients have been treated with immunotherapeutic agents, their survival has been prolonged compared to before. It is well known that BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase) is predominantly found in cells of the hematopoietic system. However, there is a distinct lack of literature on BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and its effect on the immune microenvironment. Consequently, the main goal of this investigation was to analyze how BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma affects its progression, along with its prognostic significance, through the utilization of bioinformatics online resources and publicly available databases. Data on the sequencing results and clinical records of lung adenocarcinoma patients were gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the expression level of BKT, TCGA categorized lung adenocarcinoma patients into BTK high-expression and low-expression groups. We investigated the effects of BKT on clinicopathologic, genomic, and immunologic characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma patients. We analyzed BTK mRNA expression in tumors and normal tissues using two key resources: Tumor Immuno Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER 2.0) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA 2). We analyzed the prognosis of the patients using GEPIA2 and validated the results using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, we assessed BTK protein expression by Human Protein Atlas (HPA). We sought to elucidate the clinical prognostic significance of BTK in The TCGA using the online tool GEPIA 2. Furthermore, to clarify the biologic roles and pathways linked to BTK, we conducted a genomic enrichment analysis of the information. To predict the proportion of various immune cell infiltrations in the immune microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed in the TCGA database, we performed an analysis using the TIMER online tool. Using TIMER and CIBERSORT, the correlation between genes co-expressed with BTK and the corresponding tumor-infiltrating immune cells was explored; finally, the relationship between BTK expression and immune infiltration and immune checkpoints in the TMB group and the high and low groups was analyzed by R language analysis using the TCGA database. The expression of BTK provides some hints about the prognosis of the patients. The high expression of BTK is involved in immune response regulation signaling pathways, leukocyte-mediated immunity, leukocyte intercellular adhesion, graft rejection, and complement. Analysis of the GEPIA 2 database showed that BTK was co-expressed with the genes FGD2, SASH3, NCKAP1L, CD53, ARHGAP30 and LPXN. Increased expression of the above-mentioned genes resulted in increased proportions of CD8 + T cells, memory CD4 + T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and decreased proportions of Treg cells and TH2 cells. In addition, our study revealed a strong positive correlation between various key immune checkpoints (for example, PDCD1, CD274, PDCD1LG2, CTLA4, HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and SIGLEC15) and BTK expression. In conclusion, increased BTK expression in lung adenocarcinoma is closely associated with prolonged survival of lung-cancer patients. Moreover, the genes classified under the BTK high-expression group exhibit significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, suggesting a potential impact on the tumor microenvironment. We investigated the potential of BTK as a tumor suppressor gene in predicting prolonged patient survival. In addition, we further investigated the possibility that BTK further affects the immunotherapeutic response of patients by influencing the microenvironment of tumor immune infiltration, but the relevant mechanisms remain to be further studied.",1
"Three 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) derivatives (named C4–C6) including DNJ and tegafur (TGF) were designed and synthesized, and their antiproliferative effects were investigated. C4–C6, especially C6, exerted good lipophilicity, α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and antitumor effects. Mechanism studies indicated that C6 significantly induced cell apoptosis and S-phase block and inhibited migration of HCT-116 cells. Besides, C6 induced mitochondrial damage by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, improving the accumulation of ROS, upregulating the expression of Bax, and downregulating Bcl-2. Moreover, C6 induced excessive production of ROS to trigger oxidative stress, resulting in an increase in the level of MDA and NO, a decrease in the content of GSH and SOD, and an overexpression of Nrf2. Furthermore, C6 induced DNA damage by down-regulating the expression of thymidylate synthase. These results indicated that C6 is a potential antitumor agent and kills HCT-116 cells through DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress.","We develop a family of mathematical models to predict patient-specific response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. The models capture key features of tumor growth, therapeutic response, and tissue mechanics that are informed by diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. We then calibrate the models to synthetic and clinical data using Bayesian inference to give a description of the parameter uncertainties. Given the family of models and the calibration scheme, we perform three analyses. First, we test the identifiability of each model; that is, given synthetic data with the same level of noise as that seen in the clinical setting, are we able to accurately recover parameter values employed to generate the data? Second, we test the identifiability of the framework itself; that is, when data is generated by one model from the family, is that model selected as the best one during the calibration? Third, we apply our model family to predict patient-specific response on a cohort of 32 patients with triple negative breast cancer. For analysis 1, we show that we can recover the parameters used to generate synthetic data (with 5%, 10%, and 15% Gaussian noise − greater than that typically seen in magnetic resonance imaging in the clinical setting) with a mean error of 5.9% (+/−1.4%). For analysis 2, the model used to generate the data is selected as the best model for over 50% of the synthetic data sets, provided that the noise level in the synthetic data is less than 10%. For analysis 3, we show that the calibrated drug efficacy rate in the diffusion and proliferation mechanically coupled, drug informed, reaction diffusion model strongly correlates with patient response to therapy with an area under the curve score of 0.85 in a receiver operator characteristic analysis. Thus, our framework shows that, within the noise levels encountered in the clinical setting, a high level of rigor can be achieved for mathematical model parameterizations and selections, and this translates into high accuracy for predicting responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant therapy.",0
"Infusion of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that target B cells has proven to be a successful treatment for B cell malignancies. This success inspired the development of CAR T cells to selectively deplete or modulate the aberrant immune responses that underlie autoimmune disease. Promising results are emerging from clinical trials of CAR T cells targeting the B cell protein CD19 in patients with B cell-driven autoimmune diseases. Further approaches are being designed to extend the application and improve safety of CAR T cell therapy in the setting of autoimmunity, including the use of chimeric autoantibody receptors to selectively deplete autoantigen-specific B cells and the use of regulatory T cells engineered to express antigen-specific CARs for targeted immune modulation. Here we highlight important considerations, such as optimal target cell populations, CAR construct design, acceptable toxicities and potential for lasting immune reset, that will inform the eventual safe adoption of CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), resulting in poor clinical outcomes and high mortality. The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Punicalagin (PCG), a polyphenol obtained from the Punica granatum, against TNBC. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of PCG in TNBC (MDA-MB-231, BT-20) and ER + (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. A dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was observed with PCG (12.5–100 μM). However, only 50 and 100 μM doses of PCG inhibited the growth of BT-20 and MCF-7 cells. PCG significantly increased mitochondrial ROS in TNBC cells and induced autophagy across all cell lines, as evidenced by an increase in autophagic vacuoles and a decrease in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. PCG suppressed PI3K/Akt and activated phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) signaling. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that PCG is capable of significantly inhibiting the proliferation of TNBC cells through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway as well as the initiation of the JNK pathway. PCG could thus be potentially useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of TNBC.Graphical abstract",0
"Even though both targeted and immunotherapy-based therapies have been established as frontline standard-of-care for patients with advanced lung cancer, adverse events, resistance, and disease progression remain unavoidable in most instances. In this scenario, chemotherapy is a popular salvage option, but it has restricted therapeutic index. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a viable option. ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy to deliver cytotoxic payloads to cancer cells in a direct fashion. Among the promising ADCs used in advanced solid tumors, HER2 targeted ADCs of trastuzumab ematansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan are key drugs in this field.","The dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), which may result from genomic alterations or modulation by upstream effectors, is implicated in cancer oncogenesis and progression. CDK12 overexpression or activation is sufficient to induce tumor initiation, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance. However, CDK12 may also exert tumor-suppressive functions in a context-dependent manner. Therefore, caution is warranted when targeting CDK12 in future clinical trials. A comprehensive elucidation of the dual roles and underlying mechanisms of CDK12 in carcinogenesis is urgently needed to advance precision oncology. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the dysregulation and biological roles of CDK12 in cancer. Subsequently, we systematically summarize the functions and mechanisms of the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles of CDK12 in different contexts. Finally, we discuss the potential of CDK12 as a novel therapeutic target and its implications in clinical oncology, offering insights into future directions for innovative cancer treatment strategies.",1
"PurposeMitophagy and aging (MiAg) are very important pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to tumorigenesis. MiAg-related genes have prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, prognostic, and immune correlation studies of MiAg-related genes in LUAD are lacking.MethodsMiAg differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LUAD were obtained from public sequencing datasets. A prognostic model including MiAg DEGs was constructed according to patients divided into low- and high-risk groups. Gene Ontology, gene set enrichment analysis, gene set variation analysis, CIBERSORT immune infiltration analysis, and clinical characteristic correlation analyses were performed for functional annotation and correlation of MiAgs with prognosis in patients with LUAD.ResultsSeven MiAg DEGs of LUAD were identified: CAV1, DSG2, DSP, MYH11, NME1, PAICS, PLOD2, and the expression levels of these genes were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). The RiskScore of the MiAg DEG prognostic model demonstrated high predictive ability of overall survival of patients diagnosed with LUAD. Patients with high and low MiAg phenotypic scores exhibited significant differences in the infiltration levels of eight types of immune cells (P < 0.05). The multi-factor DEG regression model showed higher efficacy in predicting 5-year survival than 3- and 1-year survival of patients with LUAD.ConclusionsSeven MiAg-related genes were identified to be significantly associated with the prognosis of patients diagnosed with LUAD. Moreover, the identified MiAg DEGs might affect the immunotherapy strategy of patients with LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05390-x.","Background:Compared to adult cancers, pediatric cancers are uniquely characterized by a genomically stable landscape and lower tumor mutational burden. However, alternative splicing, a global cellular process that produces different mRNA/protein isoforms from a single mRNA transcript, has been increasingly implicated in the development of pediatric cancers.Design:We review the current literature on the role of alternative splicing in adult cancer, cancer predisposition syndromes, and pediatric cancers. We also describe multiple splice variants identified in adult cancers and confirmed through comprehensive genomic profiling in our institutional cohort of rare, refractory and relapsed pediatric and adolescent young adult cancer patients. Finally, we summarize the contributions of alternative splicing events to neoantigens and chemoresistance and prospects for splicing-based therapies.Results:Published dysregulated splicing events can be categorized as exon inclusion, exon exclusion, splicing factor upregulation, or splice site alterations. We observe these phenomena in cancer predisposition syndromes (Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, CHEK2) and pediatric leukemia (B-ALL), sarcomas (Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma), retinoblastoma, Wilms tumor, and neuroblastoma. Within our institutional cohort, we demonstrate splice variants in key regulatory genes (CHEK2, TP53, PIK3R1, MDM2, KDM6A, NF1) that resulted in exon exclusion or splice site alterations, which were predicted to impact functional protein expression and promote tumorigenesis. Differentially spliced isoforms and splicing proteins also impact neoantigen creation and treatment resistance, such as imatinib or glucocorticoid regimens. Additionally, splice-altering strategies with the potential to change the therapeutic landscape of pediatric cancers include antisense oligonucleotides, adeno-associated virus gene transfers, and small molecule inhibitors.Conclusions:Alternative splicing plays a critical role in the formation and growth of pediatric cancers, and our institutional cohort confirms and highlights the broad spectrum of affected genes in a variety of cancers. Further studies that elucidate the mechanisms of disease-inducing splicing events will contribute toward the development of novel therapeutics.",0
"Although obesity-related asthma is associated with worse asthma outcomes, optimal treatment approaches for this complex phenotype are still largely unavailable. This state-of-the-art review article synthesizes evidence for existing and emerging treatment approaches for obesity-related asthma and highlights pathways that offer potential targets for novel therapeutics. Existing treatments targeting insulin resistance and obesity, including metformin and GLP-1 (glucagon-like-peptide 1) receptor agonists, have been associated with improved asthma outcomes, although GLP-1R agonist data in asthma are limited to individuals with comorbid obesity. Monoclonal antibodies approved for treatment of moderate to severe asthma generally appear to be effective in individuals with obesity, although this is based on retrospective or secondary analysis of clinical trials; moreover, although most of these asthma biologics are approved for use in the pediatric population, the impact of obesity on their efficacy has not been well studied in youth. Potential therapeutic targets being investigated include IL-6, arginine metabolites, nitro-fatty acids, and mitochondrial antioxidants, with clinical trials for each currently underway. Potential therapeutic targets include adipose tissue eosinophils and the GLP-1–arginine–advanced glycation end products axis, although data in humans are still needed. Finally, transcriptomic and epigenetic studies of “obese asthma” demonstrate enrichment of IFN-related signaling pathways, Rho-GTPase pathways, and integrins, suggesting that these too could represent future treatment targets. We advocate for further study of these potential therapeutic mechanisms and continued investigation of the distinct inflammatory pathways characteristic of obesity-related asthma, to facilitate effective treatment development for this unique asthma phenotype.","ABSTRACTAutophagy, a lysosome-dependent protein degradation mechanism, is a highly conserved catabolic process seen in all eukaryotes. This cell protection system, which is present in all tissues and functions at a basic level, can be up- or downregulated in response to various stresses. A disruption in the natural route of the autophagy process is frequently followed by an interruption in the inherent operation of the body’s cells and organs. Probiotics are live bacteria that protect the host through various mechanisms. One of the processes through which probiotics exert their beneficial effects on various cells and tissues is autophagy. Autophagy can assist in maintaining host homeostasis by stimulating the immune system and affecting numerous physiological and pathological responses. In this review, we particularly focus on autophagy impairments occurring in several human illnesses and investigate how probiotics affect the autophagy process under various circumstances.Abbreviation: AD: Alzheimer disease; AKT: AKT serine/threonine kinase; AMPK: 5′AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy related; CCl4: carbon tetrachloride; CFS: cell-free supernatant; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CRC: colorectal cancer; EPS: L. plantarum H31 exopolysaccharide; HD: Huntington disease; HFD: high-fat diet; HPV: human papillomavirus; IFNG/IFN-γ: interferon gamma; IL6: interleukin 6; LGG: L. rhamnosus GG; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; PD: Parkinson disease; Pg3G: pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PolyQ: polyglutamine; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SCFAs: short-chain fatty acids; SLAB51: a novel formulation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria; Slp: surface layer protein (of acidophilus NCFM); SNCA: synuclein alpha; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase 1; YB: B. longum subsp. infantis YB0411; YFP: yeast fermentate prebiotic.",1
"PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of main tumor resection on long-term survival compared with pleural biopsy alone in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were intraoperatively diagnosed with pleural metastasis.Materials and MethodsA total of 176 patients with adenocarcinoma who had unexpected pleural metastasis detected during surgery from 2002 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Each surgeon decided whether to perform main tumor resection or pleural biopsy alone.ResultsThe patients were grouped based on the surgical approaches: main tumor resection (resection group; n=83) and pleural biopsy only (O&C group; n=93). The resection group had better overall survival (OS; 10-year survival, 27.9% vs. 9.4%; median survival, 68.3 vs. 36.6 months; p < 0.01) and locoregional progression-free survival (10-year survival, 12.5% vs. 7.1%; median survival, 19.6 vs. 10.6 months; p < 0.01) than the O&C group. Similar results were found for OS in patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line therapy (10-year survival, 49.2% vs. 15.0%; median survival, 72.2 vs. 45.4 months; p=0.03), patients who did not undergo TKIs treatment (10-year survival, 29.4% vs. 9.2%; median survival, 82.4 vs. 23.8 months; p < 0.01), and patients with positive target gene mutation (10-year survival, 31.7% vs. 10.1%; median survival, 72.2 vs. 33.7 months; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, pleural biopsy only (hazard ratio, 1.73; p=0.04) was a significant predictor of OS.ConclusionMain tumor resection can improve survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who had unexpected pleural metastasis during operation.","PurposeWe aimed to assess the predictive value of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) therapy using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted at Seoul National University Hospital. Patients with EGFR/ALK-wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received ICBs between December 2013 and December 2019 were enrolled. Patients with archived blood samples collected prior to ICB treatment were assigned to the ELISA cohort. In addition, those with tissue samples from sites of recurrence or metastasis were assigned to an IHC cohort. Then, we analyzed Gal-3 expression in both cohorts.ResultsFifty-six patients in the ELISA cohort were grouped into low (N = 36) and high (N = 20) groups, using the mean Gal-3 ELISA level (13.24 pg/ml) as a cutoff. The high group demonstrated trends toward reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (0.9 vs. 3.7 months, p = 0.196) and significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (1.6 vs. 12.3 months, p = 0.018) than the low group. We categorized 94 patients in the IHC cohort into negative (N = 31) and positive (N = 63) groups based on Gal-3 IHC positivity. However, the median PFS (4.6 vs. 4.6 months for the negative vs. positive IHC group, respectively, p = 0.345) and OS (16.4 vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.137) were not significantly different.ConclusionHigh blood Gal-3 levels may predict inferior survival in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with ICBs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04275-9.",1
"AbstractLarge type 3 and type 4 gastric cancers (GC) have a significantly poor prognosis, primarily due to their high predisposition for peritoneal dissemination. The application of intraperitoneal chemotherapy has emerged as a viable therapeutic strategy for managing GC patients with peritoneal metastasis. This study is planned to enroll 37 resectable large type 3 or type 4 GC patients. These patients are scheduled to undergo a treatment comprising preoperative chemotherapy with paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and S-1, followed by D2 gastrectomy, and concluding with postoperative treatments that include prophylactic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The study’s primary objective is to evaluate the 3-year peritoneal recurrence rate. Secondary objectives are to assess the 3-year disease-free survival, 3-year overall survival and to monitor the adverse events.Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR2400083253 (","In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether anlotinib reverses osimertinib resistance by inhibiting the formation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. In a clinical case, anlotinib reversed osimertinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analyses on tumor tissues from three NSCLC patients with osimertinib resistance to analyze alterations in the expression levels of EMT markers and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) before and after the development of osimertinib resistance. The results revealed the downregulation of E-cadherin, coupled with the upregulation of vimentin and VEGFA in tumor tissues of patients exhibiting osimertinib resistance, compared with those in tissues from patients before receiving osimertinib. Subsequently, we established osimertinib-resistant (Osi-R) cell lines and found that the Osi-R cells acquired EMT features. Next, we analyzed the synergistic effects of the combination therapy to verify whether anlotinib could reverse osimertinib resistance by inhibiting EMT. The expression levels of VEGFA and tube formation were analyzed in the combination group in vitro. Finally, we determined the reversal of osimertinib resistance by the combination of osimertinib and anlotinib in vivo using 20 nude mice. The combined treatment of osimertinib and anlotinib effectively prevented the metastasis of Osi-R cells, inhibited tumor growth, exerted antitumor activity, and ultimately reversed osimertinib resistance in mice. The co-administration of osimertinib and anlotinib demonstrated synergistic efficacy in inhibiting EMT and angiogenesis in three NSCLC patients, ultimately reversing osimertinib resistance.",0
"ABSTRACTObjectivesTo evaluate the effects of CALM intervention on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), and heart rate variability (HRV) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.MethodsA total of 153 NSCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to the CALM group and usual care (UC) group. Patients in the CALM group were received 6 CALM intervention sessions over a 12-week period and evaluated using CRF, QOL and HRV at baseline (T0) and after 2, 4, and 6 intervention sessions.ResultsThe CALM group showed significant differences in total CRF, behavioral/daily life CRF, emotional/affective CRF, sensory/physical CRF, cognitive CRF and QOL before and after CALM intervention sessions (F = 643.47, F = 208.34, F = 354.52, F = 285.69, F = 334.29, F = 245.77, p < 0.001). The CALM group showed significant increases in standard deviation of normal R-R interval (SDNN) and high-frequency power (HF) (z = −4.94, p < 0.001,z = −4.30, p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were observed between CRF and SDNN, HF and QOL across all participants.ConclusionsThe CALM intervention had a positive impact on overall physical and mental health, fatigue reduction, quality of life and autonomic dysfunction in NSCLC patients. Heart rate variability may serve as an observational indicator of physical and mental health.","BackgroundDespite advances in precision medicine for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), biomarker testing for these therapies remains frequently underused, delayed, and inequitable. Pulmonologists often play a critical role in the initial diagnostic steps for patients with lung cancer, and previous data show variability in their knowledge and practices regarding biomarker testing. The purpose of this study is to better understand how pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care.Research QuestionWith the increasing importance of biomarker testing and precision medicine, how do pulmonologists view their role in lung cancer care?Study DesignAn electronic survey consisting of 31 items focused on attitudes and practices regarding diagnostic steps for NSCLC was randomly distributed to a sample of practicing pulmonologists in the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) analytics database. Inferential statistics were performed using χ2 tests and multivariable logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 401 pulmonologists responded to the survey. Most (92%) were general pulmonologists, and more than one-half (62%) indicated they order biomarker testing. Longer practice tenure, higher case volumes, and participation in a multidisciplinary tumor board were associated with ordering biomarkers (P < .05). Pulmonology was identified to have the leading responsibility for the initial diagnostic biopsy by most respondents (83%) and less often for staging (45%), leading discussions about biomarker testing with patients (28%), and for ordering biomarkers (22%). The most common reasons for not ordering biomarkers included the following: oncology was responsible (84%), it was not within their scope of practice (46%), or lack of the necessary knowledge (51%).InterpretationThis study shows that pulmonologists vary in their practices for ordering biomarkers, and many defer this responsibility to oncology. Despite the role of bronchoscopy and pulmonology societal guidelines for staging, many defer leadership of this process. Many pulmonologists lack the necessary resources and multidisciplinary infrastructure likely required to efficiently accomplish biomarker testing.",1
"BackgroundThe CD-TK double suicide gene has become an effective therapy for bladder cancer. A novel molecular-targeted ultrasound (US) method has been developed to precisely guide nanobubbles loaded with this gene to regions within bladder tumor cells and is widely used due to its efficiency in delivering drugs to the target tumor.MethodsUniform nanoscaled nanobubbles loaded with CD-TK double suicide gene were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods.ResultsIn the present study, we synthesized CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded cationic nanobubbles conjugated with anti-VEGFR2 that can bind with VEGFR2-positive cells. Fluorescence and flow cytometry evidence show that CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded nanobubbles were successfully developed. CD-TK-CNBs delivered via US-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) enhanced transfection efficiency, overexpression of CD-TK double suicide gene, and tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro.ConclusionsThese CD-TK-CNBs may become a novel treatment for bladder cancer.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",0
"Purpose of ReviewAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal blood neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in mitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by novel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluation.Recent FindingsMetabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity to therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial metabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a breakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial complexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting these vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy in preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results limited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on drug combinations with synergistic or additive activity.SummaryIn this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies targeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the specific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to achieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that currently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or are not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells. Thus, further studies of complex metabolic rewiring of leukemia cells before and after combinatorial therapies are warranted.","Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), a known target for cancer immunotherapy, was crystallized with novel crystal packing, resulting in a true apo PTPN2 crystal structure with an unbound active site.

"PurposeNRAS plays a pivotal role in progression of various kinds of somatic malignancies; however, the correlation between NRAS and lung adenocarcinoma is less known. We aim to analyze the prognostic value of NRAS expression in lung adenocarcinoma, and explore the relationship between NRAS and tumor immune microenvironment.MethodsWe obtained the transcriptome profiles and clinical data of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and three Genome Expression Omnibus datasets. Specimens from 325 patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma were collected for immunohistochemical assays of NRAS, PD-L1, PD-1 and TIM-3. Then, we performed gene set enrichment analysis to investigate cancer-related and immune-related signaling pathways. TIMER algorithms were performed to evaluate tumor immune infiltrating cells and immune-related biomarkers.ResultsCompared with adjacent non-tumor tissue, NRAS expression was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissue. NRAS expression was significantly correlated with more advanced stage and positive lymph nodes. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox analysis suggested that high NRAS expression led to a poor prognosis, and could be an independent prognostic factor in LUAD patients. Besides, NRAS expression was positively correlated with CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, and negatively correlated with B cells and CD4+ T cells. The expression level of NRAS was positively correlated with PD-L1, PD-1, and TIM-3 both at RNA and protein level.ConclusionsTo conclude, we found NRAS is a novel prognostic biomarker in LUAD. Besides, the expression level of NRAS may influence the prognosis of LUAD via various kinds of cancer-related pathways and remodeling TIM.","PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.",1
"ABSTRACTFor the past few years, researchers and oncologists have been pushing to find biomarkers that would help predict which treatment option would best work on a patient. Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is one of the latest biomarkers that is being studied and considered as a promising agnostic immunotherapy biomarker. However, it still shows controversial results in studies due to the difficulty in finding solid comparable results. This is a consequence of different cutoff definitions among many cancer types, age ranges, and the use of different sequencing assays, in addition to its association with other biomarkers such as PD-L1. Finally, the use of composite biomarkers to assess the genetic signature of a tumor might be the way forward to seriously use TMB as an agnostic biomarker.","ABSTRACTBackgroundTumoral melanosis (TM) is a histological term to describe a nodular aggregation of macrophages containing melanin pigment (melanophages) that is devoid of viable melanocytes. It is most often identified in skin, where it may be appreciated clinically as a pigmented lesion; however, it can also be found in other organs such as lymph nodes. The presence of TM is usually thought to signify the presence of a regressed melanoma or other pigmented tumor. Until recently, it was a relatively uncommon finding; however, with the use of effective systemic therapies against melanoma, its occurrence in histological specimens is more frequent.MethodsWe identified and reviewed all histopathological diagnoses of TM at any organ site reported at a single institution from 2006 to 2018. TM cases were paired with non‐TM cases of cutaneous melanoma through propensity score matching at a 1:2 ratio, and their survival outcomes were compared. The clinical outcomes examined included recurrence‐free survival (RFS), distant disease‐free survival (DDFS), melanoma‐specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).ResultsTM was reported in 79 patients. Their median age was 65 years (range 22–88), with a 2:1 male predominance (51 out of 79, 65%). The most common organ involved was the skin (67%), with a third of all cases localized to a lower limb (36%). TM had a strong association with the presence of melanoma (91%) and regression at other sites of melanoma (54%), suggesting that it is part of a systemic immune response against melanoma. Most patients with TM either previously or subsequently developed histologically confirmed melanoma in the same anatomical region as the TM (89%). Thirty‐five TM patients were matched with 70 non‐TM cases. Patients with melanoma who developed TM without prior regional or systemic therapy showed improved MSS (p = 0.03), whereas no statistically significant differences were observed in terms of RFS, DDFS, and OS.ConclusionsTM usually occurs in the context of a previous or subsequent cutaneous melanoma and is associated with improved MSS.

"PurposeThe current evaluation methods for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly CD8 + TILs, mainly rely on semiquantitative immunohistochemistry with high variability. We aimed to construct an individualized DNA methylation-based signature for CD8 + TILs (CD8 + MeTIL) that may characterize melanoma immune microenvironment and guide therapeutic selection.MethodsThe transcriptome profiles and DNA methylation data of 457 melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed. Differential methylation analysis between groups with high and low CD8 + TILs was performed to select differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and define CD8 + MeTIL. The prognostic value of CD8 + MeTIL and its predictive value for immunotherapy response were investigated using multiple melanoma cohorts.ResultsWe successfully constructed the CD8 + MeTIL signature based on four DMPs. The survival analyses showed that higher CD8 + MeTIL score was associated with worse survival outcomes in TCGA-SKCM and GSE144487 cohorts. The ROC curve for the predictive analysis revealed that the survival prediction of CD8 + MeTIL score was superior compared with CD8 + TILs (CIBERSORT) and CD8B mRNA expression. Furthermore, we founded that tumors with higher CD8 + MeTIL score were marked with immunosuppressive characteristics, including low immune score and downregulated immune-related pathways. More importantly, the CD8 + MeTIL score showed a potential predictive value for the benefit from immunotherapy in two published cohorts. When combined CD8 + MeTIL with PD-L1 expression, the patient classification showed significantly different immunotherapy response rates and long-term survival outcomes.ConclusionsThe CD8 + MeTIL signature might be as a novel method to evaluate CD8 + TILs and guide immunotherapy approaches.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04566-1.","PurposeTo explore the feasibility and performance of machine learning-based radiomics models in predicting thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsA total of 227 NSCLC patients were included in this retrospective study and divided into the training set and test set with a ratio of 8:2 randomly. Lung tumors on CT images were semi-automatic segmented utilizing 3D Slicer. Radiomic features quantifying tumor intensity, shape, texture, and transformed wavelet were extracted using a Python toolkit. Variance threshold (VT), principal component analysis (PCA), and least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) were used to reduce features; logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to develop classifier, respectively. The performance of the models was evaluated by areas under the curves (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Different models were compared by the Delong test to determine the optimal algorithms.ResultsTotal 1968 radiomic features were extracted from the lung tumors images, and then 13, 15, and 13 stable features were selected by VT, PCA, and LASSO, respectively. Each classifier could discriminate against the TTF-1-positive groups with average AUC ranging from 0.601 to 0.784 in the training set. Among the models, three models constructed by the LASSO method showed satisfactory performance in the test set with AUC ranging from 0.715 to 0.787. The Delong test showed no significant difference between the LASSO models (P > 0.05).ConclusionMachine learning-based radiomics model could predict the expression of TTF-1 in NSCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04357-8.",1
"BackgroundEGFR exon 20 insertion (EGFR ex20ins) mutations account for about 10–12% of all EGFR-mutated tumors, which are usually associated with primary drug resistance to conventional EGFR-TKI therapy and worse survival outcomes, and are currently a major problem for clinicians in clinical management. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of sequencing technology and careful review of clinical data, investigators have gained a deeper understanding and clearer cognition of the clinicopathological features and molecular mechanisms of these EGFR ex20ins mutations.PurposeThe aim of this study was to systemically review the molecular structure and clinical characteristics of EGFR ex20ins mutations, and focus on summarizing the latest data of emerging therapies (including novel small-molecule EGFR-TKI drugs, specific monoclonal antibodies, novel drugs targeting other mechanisms, and immunotherapy) for those patients.ConclusionAdvances in overcoming these systemic challenges have greatly accelerated the development of new drugs targeting EGFR ex20ins, and are committed to designing more rational combination therapies to overcome or delay the emergence of drug resistance, ultimately improve the prognosis of such uncommon mutant populations.","With more treatment options in oncology lead to better outcomes and more favorable side effect profiles, patients are living longer — with higher quality of life — than ever, with a growing survivor population.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and life-threatening neoplastic disease that continues to pose a formidable challenge to global health. The present work was performed to evaluate the anticancer properties of betanin and betanin (BT) loaded starch nanoparticles (S-BT). The BT and S-BT were characterized by DLS, SEM, UV spectroscopy, XPS and FTIR. The cytotoxic effect was assessed by MTT and LDH assay. The apoptotic potential of BT and S-BT was assessed by DCFDA, Rh123, AO/EB and DAPI staining methods. Cell cycle arrest was depicted using flow cytometry. The antimetastatic potential of BT and S-BT was evaluated by wound healing assay. The S-BT showed a spherical morphology with a size of 175 nm. The betanin contained SNPs were found to have strong encapsulation efficiency and favorable release profiles. Both BT and S-BT exhibited cytotoxicity in SW480 cells but S-BT displayed increased cytotoxicity when compared to BT alone. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation and generation of ROS, all indicative of apoptotic mode of cell death, were revealed by fluorescence imaging. The cells were arrested in the G2M phase. Moreover, both BT and S-BT were able to inhibit the migratory potential of SW480 cells. Overall, our results indicated that both BT and S-BT were able to induce anticancer effects; and, S-BT was found to have increased therapeutic efficacy when compared to BT alone.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and highly recurrent malignancies worldwide and currently ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The high degree of morbidity and mortality associated with CRC is primarily attributed to the limited effectiveness of current therapeutic approaches and the emergence of chemoresistance to standard treatment modalities. Recent research indicates that several natural products, including Aronia berry extracts (ABE) and oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs), might offer a safe, cost-effective, and multi-targeted adjunctive role to cancer treatment. Herein, we hypothesized a combined treatment with ABE and OPCs could synergistically modulate multiple oncogenic pathways in CRC, thereby enhancing their anticancer activity. We initially conducted a series of in vitro experiments to assess the synergistic anticancer effects of ABE and OPCs on CRC cell lines. We demonstrate that these two compounds exhibited a superior synergistic anti-cancer potential vs. individual treatments in enhancing the ability to inhibit cell viability, suppress colony formation, and induce apoptosis (p < 0.05). Consistent with our in vitro findings, we validated this combinatorial anti-cancer effect in tumor-derived 3D organoids (PDOs; p < 0.01). Using genome-wide transcriptomic profiling, we identified that a specific gene, LMNB1, associated with the cell apoptosis pathway, was found to play a crucial role in exhibiting anti-cancer effects with these two products. Furthermore, the combined treatment of ABE and OPCs significantly impacted the expression of key proteins involved in apoptosis, including suppressed expression levels of LMNB1 in CRC cell lines (p < 0.05), which resulted in inhibiting downstream AKT phosphorylation. In conclusion, our study provides novel evidence of the synergistic anticancer effects of ABE and OPCs in CRC cells, partially mediated through the regulation of apoptosis and the oncogene LMNB1 within the AKT signaling pathway. These findings have the potential to better appreciate the anticancer potential of natural products in CRC and help improve treatment outcomes in this malignancy.",1
"AbstractMost patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have limited treatment options following standard-of-care therapy. VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05425940 (ClinicalTrials.gov)","AbstractBackgroundGlioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary central nervous system tumor characterized by poor outcomes. In case of relapse or progression to adjuvant chemotherapy, there is no univocal preferred regimen for relapsing glioblastoma.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and Bayesian trial-level network meta-analyses (NMA) to identify the regimens associated with the best outcomes. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR). We estimated separate treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values. Only phase II/III prospective comparative trials were included.ResultsTwenty-four studies (3733 patients and 27 different therapies) were ultimately included. Twenty-three different regimens were compared for OS, 21 for PFS, and 26 for ORR. When taking lomustine as a common comparator, only regorafenib was likely to be significantly superior in terms of OS (hazard ratio: 0.50, 95% credible interval: 0.33-0.75). Regorafenib was significantly superior to other 16 (69.6%) regimens, including NovoTTF-100A, bevacizumab monotherapy, and several bevacizumab-based combinations. Regarding PFS and ORR, no treatment was clearly superior to the others.ConclusionsThis NMA supports regorafenib as one of the best available options for relapsing/refractory glioblastoma. Lomustine, NovoTTF-100A, and bevacizumab emerge as other viable alternative regimens. However, evidence on regorafenib is controversial at best. Moreover, most studies were underpowered, with varying inclusion criteria and primary endpoints, and no longer adapted to the most recent glioblastoma classification. A paradigmatic change in clinical trials’ design for relapsing/refractory glioblastoma and more effective treatments are urgently required.",1
"PurposeThere is uncertainty regarding the role of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).MethodsWe identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICIs combined with NACT to NACT in early-stage TNBC. Efficacy outcomes included pathological complete response (pCR) and event-free survival (EFS). Toxicity data included any grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, AEs leading to death, common and meaningful AEs associated with chemotherapy and immune-related AEs. Odds ratio (ORs), hazard ratios (HR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) for efficacy and toxicity were extracted and pooled in a meta-analysis. Differences in the odds for pCR between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status and between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors were also assessed.ResultsFive RCTs comprising 2,075 patients were analyzed. Compared to NACT alone, combination of ICIs and NACT significantly improved pCR (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25–2.47, p = 0.001) and EFS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48–0.91, p = 0.01). Magnitude of effect on pCR was similar between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors (p for the subgroup difference = 0.80) and between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors (p = 0.27). The combination treatment resulted in higher odds of any grade 3/4 AEs (OR 1.31, p = 0.02) and serious AEs (OR 1.84, p = 0.006), with no statistically significant difference in AEs leading to death (OR 1.67, p = 0.51). Higher magnitude of toxicity was observed for immune-related AEs.ConclusionCombination of ICIs and NACT were associated with improved outcome in early-stage TNBC while increasing toxicity significantly. Longer follow-up is desired to better understand the risk and benefit ratio of this combination.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03591-w.","BackgroundThis study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MethodsElectronic databases were scanned to identify relevant trials. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and their prognostic factors. Stratified analyses were accomplished on ICIs agent and evaluation criteria.ResultsTotally, 3697 individuals from 40 cohorts were recruited. For patients treated with ICIs, the pooled median time to progression (TTP) was 8.0 months, median PFS 4.9 months, and median OS 12.0 months; the pooled median PFS and OS of ICIs plus anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents (PFS: 6.3 months, OS: 16.4 months) were longer than those of ICIs alone. Furthermore, Child–Pugh stage (HR = 1.37, P = 0.0123) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (HR = 1.40, P = 0.0016) were prognostic factors for PFS. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0356), Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR = 1.17, P < 0.0001), Child–Pugh stage (HR = 1.58, P < 0.0001), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (HR = 1.23, P = 0.0005), ECOG (HR = 1.50, P = 0.0012), portal vein invasion (HR = 1.32, P = 0.0053), extrahepatic metastasis (HR = 0.84, P = 0.0047), best response (HR = 0.58, P < 0.0001), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (HR = 1.23, P = 0.0451) were the prognostic factors for OS. According to both RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) rate of ICIs plus anti-VEGF agents were better than those of ICIs alone. The overall rate of any grade adverse events (AEs) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.61–0.89), grade 3 or higher AEs was 0.28 (95% CI 0.15–0.42), and the rate of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 0.09 (95% CI 0.06–0.12).ConclusionsThe ICIs was promising in HCC with good efficacy and tolerated toxicity. Compared with ICIs monotherapy, the joint application of ICIs and anti-VEGF agents can contribute a lot more benefits to the survival of patients according to clinical practices.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03716-1.",1
"AbstractCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines reduce severe disease and mortality and may lessen transmission, measured by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load (VL). Evaluating vaccine associations in VL at COVID-19 diagnosis in 4 phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled vaccine trials, July 2020 to July 2021, VL reductions were 2.78 log10 copies/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–4.18; n = 60 placebo, 11 vaccine) and 2.12 log10 copies/mL (95% CI, 1.44–2.80; n = 594 placebo, 36 vaccine) for NVX-CoV2373 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Associations were not significant for AZD1222 (0.59 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, −.19 to 1.36; n = 90 placebo, 78 vaccine) or Ad26.COV2.S (0.23 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, −.01 to .47; n = 916 placebo, 424 vaccine). Thus, vaccines potentially decreased transmission when ancestral SARS-CoV-2 predominated. Clinical Trials Registration.

However, inhibiting HDACs—an effective treatment for lymphomas—has shown limited success in solid tumors. We report the discovery of a class of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) that demonstrates exquisite selective cytotoxicity against human HCC cells. The lead compound STR-V-53  showed a favorable safety profile in mice and robustly suppressed tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of HCC. When combined with the anti-HCC drug sorafenib, STR-V-53, showed greater in vivo efficacy. Moreover, STR-V-53 combined with anti-PD1 therapy increased the CD8+ to regulatory T-cell (Treg) ratio and survival in an orthotopic HCC model in immunocompetent mice. This combination therapy resulted in durable responses in 40% of the mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that STR-V-53 primed HCC cells to immunotherapy through HDAC inhibition, impaired glucose-regulated transcription, impaired DNA synthesis, upregulated apoptosis, and stimulated the immune response pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the novel HDACi STR-V-53 is an effective anti-HCC agent that can induce profound responses when combined with standard immunotherapy.",0
"ABSTRACTCancer is increasingly being recognized as a global health issue with considerable unmet medical need. Despite the rapid progression of anticancer pharmaceuticals, there are still significant challenges for the effective management of cancer. In many circumstances, cancer cells are difficult to detect and treat. Combination of nanovesicles (NVs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), referred as magnetic nanovesicles (MNVs), is now well recognized as a potential theranostic option for improving cancer treatment outcomes and reducing adverse effects. MNVs can be used for monitoring the long-term fate and functional benefits of cancer therapy. Moreover, MNV-mediated hyperthermia mechanism has been explored as a potential technique for triggering cancer cell death, and/or controlled release of laden cargo. In this review, we focus on the unique characteristics of MNVs as a promising avenue for targeted drug delivery, diagnosis, and treatments of cancer or tumor. Moreover, we discuss critical considerations related to the issues raised in this area, which will guide future research toward better anti-cancer therapeutics for clinical applications.","Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) has a poor prognosis. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) significantly affects the development and progression of various human tumors. However, the significance and pathological mechanisms of CDKN2A in COAD remain to be elucidated. We assessed expression levels, clinical significance, biological function, co-expressed genes, and enrichment of related pathways of CDKN2A in COAD using various databases, including The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, Human Protein Atlas, STRING, GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, and Linked Omics. Our investigation showed that CDKN2A was highly expressed in colon adenocarcinomas (P < .001). It is weakly expressed or not expressed in normal tissues. The survival time of patients with colon adenocarcinoma with high CDKN2A expression is significantly shorter than that of patients with low expression levels (P = .011). There was a significant positive correlation between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and the infiltration of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Moreover, there was a significant negative association between the expression level of CDKN2A in colon adenocarcinoma tissues and B cell infiltration. The ten hub genes included tumor protein 53, V-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten, cyclin D1, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, catenin beta 1, and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase. Mutations in the CDKN2A genome in colon adenocarcinoma reduce survival. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in apoptotic signaling pathways and multiple pathways related to metabolic progression. Our results indicate that CDKN2A can be used as a marker of poor prognosis in patients with colon adenocarcinoma. CDKN2A may regulate the occurrence and development of colon adenocarcinomas by influencing immune cell infiltration and metabolic pathways.",1
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) tumors have a highly immunosuppressive desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME) where immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy has been exceptionally ineffective. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor activation leads to cancer and immune cell proliferation and phenotype, and cytokine production leading to tumor progression and worse overall survival in PDA patients. We hypothesized that TGF-β receptor inhibition may alter PDA progression and antitumor immunity in the TME. Here, we used a syngeneic preclinical murine model of PDA to explore the impact of TGF-β pathway inhibitor galunisertib (GAL), dual checkpoint immunotherapy (anti-PD-L1 and CTLA-4), the chemotherapy gemcitabine (GEM), and their combinations on antitumor immune responses. Blockade of TGF-β and ICI in immune-competent mice bearing orthotopically injected murine PDA cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and was accompanied by antitumor M1 macrophage infiltration. In contrast, GEM treatment resulted in increased PDA tumor growth, decreased antitumor M1 macrophages, and decreased cytotoxic CD8+ T cell subpopulation compared to control mice. Together, these findings demonstrate the ability of TGF-β inhibition with GAL to prime antitumor immunity in the TME and the curative potential of combining GAL with dual ICI. These preclinical results indicate that targeted inhibition of TGF-β may enhance the efficacy of dual immunotherapy in PDA. Optimal manipulation of the immune TME with non-ICI therapy may enhance therapeutic efficacy.","PurposeNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is ranked the top otorhinolaryngology malignant tumors in the world. However, the general prognosis of recurrent and metastatic (R/M) nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) remains poor, and current surgery and chemoradiotherapy do not generate satisfactory outcomes.MethodsAs a new therapeutic choice, immunotherapy, especially with regard to the development of checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors have made considerable progress in recent years. As Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with increased risk of NPC, EBV-related immunotherapy may lead to a breakthrough in advanced NPCs.ResultsIn this review, we summarized the clinical characters of NPC, and several past and ongoing clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors and EBV-CTLs (CTLs: cytotoxic T lymphocytes) in R/M NPC immunotherapy.ConclusionWe conclude that although the evaluated effects of new immunotherapy drugs have brought us hope on NPC treatment, further phase II-III trials with larger samples are still required to improve the proportion and scheme of drug collocation for better clinical outcomes and less drug-related safety.",1
"ABSTRACTAcute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous hematopoietic cancer prevalent in adults, has been a leading cause of leukemia-associated deaths for decades. Despite advancements in understanding its pathology and pharmacological targets, therapeutic strategies have seen minimal change. The standard treatment, combining cytarabine and anthracycline, has persisted, accompanied by challenges such as pharmacokinetic issues and non-specific drug delivery, leading to severe side effects. Nanotechnology offers a promising solution through combination drug delivery. FDA-approved CPX351 (VYXEOS™) a liposomal formulation delivering doxorubicin and cytarabine, exemplifies enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Ongoing research explores various nanocarriers for delivering multiple bioactives, addressing drug targeting, pharmacokinetics and chemoresistance. This review highlights nanotechnology-based combination therapies for the effective management of AML, presenting a potential breakthrough in leukemia.","The integration of nanotechnology and synthetic biology could lay the framework for new classes of engineered biosensors that produce amplified readouts of disease states. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of this vision, here we present an engineered gene circuit that, in response to cancer-associated transcriptional deregulation, expresses heterologous enzyme biomarkers whose activity can be measured by nanoparticle sensors that generate amplified detection readouts. Specifically, we designed a AND-gate gene circuit that integrates the activity of two ovarian cancer-specific synthetic promoters to drive the expression of a heterologous protein output, secreted Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease, exclusively from within tumor cells. Nanoparticle probes were engineered to carry a TEV-specific peptide substrate in order to measure the activity of the circuit-generated enzyme to yield amplified detection signals measurable in the urine or blood. We applied our integrated sense-and-respond system in a mouse model of disseminated ovarian cancer, where we demonstrated measurement of circuit-specific TEV protease activity both in vivo using exogenously administered nanoparticle sensors and ex vivo using quenched fluorescent probes. We envision that this work will lay the foundation for how synthetic biology and nanotechnology can be meaningfully integrated to achieve next-generation engineered biosensors.",1
"P2 purinergic receptor expression is dysregulated in multiple cancer subtypes and is associated with worse outcomes. Studies identify roles for P2 purinergic receptors in tumor cells that drive disease aggressiveness. There is also sufficient evidence that P2 purinergic receptor expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for disease initiation and progression. Immune cells constitute a significant component of the TME and display both tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic potential. Studies pre-dating the investigation of P2 purinergic receptors in cancer identify P2 receptor expression on multiple immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, T-cells, and dendritic cells; all of which are implicated in tumor initiation, tumor promotion, or response to treatment. Herein, we discuss P2 purinergic receptor expression and function in tumor-related immune cells. We provide a rationale for further investigations of P2 purinergic receptors within the TME to better define the mechanistic pathways of inflammation-mediate tumorigenesis and explore P2 purinergic receptors as potential targets for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.","Adipocytes are crucial components of breast cancer and are involved in regulating the progression, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Characterized by storing energy and producing a variety of secretory factors, adipocytes are responsible for inducing obesity and regulating the tumor immune activity. Adipocytes communicate with tumor infiltrating immune cells through the secreted adipokines, cytokines, and exosomes in the breast cancer TIME, which shapes the tumor supporting environment to facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. In-depth studies of the crosstalk between adipocytes and TIME can not only provide a more comprehensive regulatory landscape of TIME, but also be conducive to screening novel targets for future precision targeted therapy. The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies for understanding the role of crosstalk between adipocytes and immune cells in shaping the breast cancer immune microenvironment.",1
"Background: Medication dosing in overweight and obese children often involves complex weight-based calculations, leading to higher dosing errors, particularly with intravenous drugs. Currently, tools to aid in dosage calculations are lacking for these patients, especially in Thai population. Objective: This study aimed to develop a mobile application with the intent of utilizing it as a tool to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of dosing calculations required for obese and overweight Thai children. Methods: The performance of the application was assessed in 3 key aspects using a sample of 30 healthcare professionals. These key aspects included: 1) the accuracy of dosage calculations, assessed through pre- and posttests comparing manual calculations to app-based calculations using a 10-item questionnaire, 2) the time taken for calculations before and after app usage, 3) user satisfaction, which was measured through a questionnaire. Results: The integration of applications into the calculation demonstrated a significant improvement when compared to the manual calculation in both accuracy (6.10 vs 9.33 out of 10, P < .001) and efficiency (10.40 vs 8.53 minutes per 10 questions, P = .008). Also, the application elicited high levels of satisfaction among users, as reflected by an overall mean satisfaction score of 4.57 on a 5-point scale. Conclusion: The integration of this application to assist in dosage calculations for overweight and obese pediatric Thai patients has yielded favorable outcomes concerning accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Further development should be pursued within a larger cohort, with an emphasis on real-world implementation in clinical settings.","AbstractBackground:Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent type of cancer with a high mortality rate in its late stages. One of the major challenges in OSCC treatment is the resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanism underlying drug resistance and develop appropriate precision therapy strategies to enhance clinical efficacy.Methods:To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) inhibitor KN93 and EGFR inhibitors, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments using two FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1)-deficient (SCC9 and SCC25) and two FAT1 wild-type (SCC47 and HN12) OSCC cell lines. We assessed the effects of EGFR inhibitors (afatinib or cetuximab), KN93, or their combination on the malignant phenotype of OSCC in vivo and in vitro. The alterations in protein expression levels of members of the EGFR signaling pathway and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) were analyzed. Changes in the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) protein were characterized. Moreover, we analyzed mitochondrial dysfunction. Besides, the effects of combination therapy on mitochondrial dynamics were also evaluated.Results:OSCC with FAT1 mutations exhibited resistance to EGFR inhibitors treatment. The combination of KN93 and EGFR inhibitors significantly inhibited the proliferation, survival, and migration of FAT1-mutated OSCC cells and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, combination therapy enhanced the therapeutic sensitivity of FAT1-mutated OSCC cells to EGFR inhibitors by modulating the EGFR pathway and downregulated tumor stemness-related proteins. Furthermore, combination therapy induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, ultimately resulting in tumor suppression.Conclusion:Combination therapy with EGFR inhibitors and KN93 could be a novel precision therapeutic strategy and a potential clinical solution for EGFR-resistant OSCC patients with FAT1 mutations.",0
"PurposeDisulfidptosis is a novel type of cell death induced by disulphide stress that depends on the accumulation of cystine disulphide, causing cytotoxicity and triggering cell death. However, the direct prognostic effect and regulatory mechanism of disulfidptosis-related genes in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) remain unclear.MethodsTo explore the role of 10 disulfidptosis-related genes, the multiomic data of 10 genes were comprehensively analysed. Next, based on seven disulfidptosis-related differentially expressed genes, a novel disulfidptosis-related gene score was developed to help predict the prognosis of BLCA. Immunohistochemistry, EDU, Real-time PCR and western blot were used to verify the model.ResultsSignificant functional differences were found between the high- and low-risk score groups, and samples with a higher risk score were more malignant. Furthermore, the tumour exclusion and Tumour Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion scores of the high-risk score group were higher than those of the low-risk score group. The risk score was positively correlated with the expression of immune checkpoints. Drug sensitivity analyses revealed that the low-risk score group had a higher sensitivity to cisplatin, doxorubicin, docetaxel and gemcitabine than the high-risk score group. Moreover, the expression of the TM4SF1 was positively correlated with the malignancy degree of BLCA, and the proliferation ability of BLCA cells was reduced after knockdown TM4SF1.ConclusionThe present study results suggest that disulfidptosis-related genes influence the prognosis of BLCA through their involvement in immune cell infiltration. Thus, these findings indicate the role of disulfidptosis in BLCA and its potential regulatory mechanisms.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05235-7.","PurposeWe aimed to study the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) using bioinformatics.MethodsGSE39582 and GSE39084, which collectively contain 363 CRC samples, were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database as a test set. TCGA-COADREAD, with 376 CRC samples, was downloaded from the UCSC database as a validation set. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for ARGs that were significantly associated with prognosis. The top 10 ARGs were used to classify the samples into different subtypes based on unsupervised cluster analysis. The immune environments of the different subtypes were analyzed. ARGs that were significantly associated with CRC prognosis were used to construct a risk model. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen independent prognostic factors and construct a nomogram.ResultsFour anoikis-related subtypes (ARSs) with differential prognoses and immune microenvironments were identified. KRAS and epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathways were enriched in subtype B, which had the worst prognosis. Three ARGs (DLG1, AKT3, and LPAR1) were used to construct the risk model. Both the test and validation sets showed worse outcomes for patients in the high-risk group than those in the low-risk group. Risk score was found to be an independent prognostic factor for CRC. Moreover, there was a difference in drug sensitivity between the high- and low-risk groups.ConclusionThe identified ARGs and risk scores were associated with CRC prognosis and could predict the responses of patients with CRC to immunotherapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04945-2.",1
"Lung cancer treatment is evolving, and the role of senescent macrophages in tumor immune evasion has become a key focus. This study explores how senescent macrophages interact with lung cancer cells, contributing to tumor progression and immune dysfunction. As aging impairs macrophage functions, including phagocytosis and metabolic signaling, it promotes chronic inflammation and cancer development. p16INK4a-positive macrophages are common in aged mice, and their clearance slows tumor growth, suggesting these cells support tumor proliferation and immune evasion. Targeting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and reprogramming senescent macrophages offers potential therapeutic benefits, including reversing immune aging and boosting anti-tumor immunity. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires further molecular understanding and rigorous clinical trials.","PurposeThe treatment options for metastatic soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are limited. In most cases, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has not been successful so far. Macrophages dominate the immune landscape of STSs; thus, combinatorial strategies aiming at both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages may represent a particularly relevant treatment approach for metastatic or recurrent STSs.MethodsIn this cohort study, 66 patients who underwent surgery for STSs were enrolled. Tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In cell suspensions obtained from surgical resections, human T cells were activated by superparamagnetic polymer beads and cultured at a concentration of 0.3 × 106/µl in the absence or presence of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (anti-PD-1, anti-CD47, and anti-PD-1 + anti-CD47). Supernatants from cell suspensions were analyzed using multiplex Luminex cytokine bead-based immunoassays.ResultsThe most profound response to anti-CD47 therapy was observed in an undifferentiated pleiomorphic sarcoma which also displayed high expression of CD47 in the tumor microenvironment. Both anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 therapies drastically increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment of STSs, but co-administration of both agents did not further increase cytokine secretion. Furthermore, all patient samples treated with a combination of both anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 antibodies showed a dramatic reduction in cytokine secretion.ConclusionOur findings suggest that anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 therapies do not enhance each other, and the combined application of anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 agents in vitro limits rather than potentiates their efficacy.",0
"Adipocytes are crucial components of breast cancer and are involved in regulating the progression, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Characterized by storing energy and producing a variety of secretory factors, adipocytes are responsible for inducing obesity and regulating the tumor immune activity. Adipocytes communicate with tumor infiltrating immune cells through the secreted adipokines, cytokines, and exosomes in the breast cancer TIME, which shapes the tumor supporting environment to facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. In-depth studies of the crosstalk between adipocytes and TIME can not only provide a more comprehensive regulatory landscape of TIME, but also be conducive to screening novel targets for future precision targeted therapy. The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies for understanding the role of crosstalk between adipocytes and immune cells in shaping the breast cancer immune microenvironment.","Objective.Arthritis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies highlights the importance of immune checkpoint expression for joint homeostasis. We investigated the role of programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 in the synovium using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model.Methods.We blocked PD-L1 using blocking antibodies during CIA and assessed the arthritis severity by clinical and histologic scoring. PD-L1 expression and the origin of synovial macrophages were investigated using flow cytometry and parabiosis. We used Cre-Lox mice to ascertain the protective role of PD-L1–expressing macrophages in arthritis. The immune profile of human and murine synovial PD-L1+ macrophages was determined by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing.Results.Anti–PD-L1 antibody treatment during CIA worsened arthritis with increased immune cell infiltration compared with isotype control, supporting the regulatory role of PD-L1 in the joint. The main cells expressing PD-L1 in the synovium were macrophages. Using parabiosis, we showed that synovial PD-L1+ macrophages were both locally proliferating and partially replaced by the circulation. PD-L1+ macrophages had increased levels of MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) and interleukin (IL)-10 expression during acute CIA. Genetic depletion of PD-L1 on macrophages in LyzcrePD-L1fl/fl mice resulted in worsened CIA compared with controls. We found that human PD-L1+ macrophages in the synovium of healthy individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis express MerTK and IL-10.Conclusion.PD-L1+ macrophages with efferocytotic and anti-inflammatory characteristics protect the synovium from severe arthritis in the CIA mouse model. Tissue-protective, PD-L1–expressing macrophages are also present in the human synovium at homeostasis and during rheumatoid arthritis.",0
"BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.","BackgroundSelenium, a natural microelement with both nutritional and toxicological properties, is intertwined with tumorigenesis and progression. However, it is not fully understood how selenium metabolism affects immune response and cancer biology.MethodsWe estimated selenium metabolism by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to delineate the selenium metabolism landscape using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and a integrated pan-cancer single-cell dataset. We systematically explored the prognostic implications of selenium metabolism and selenium-related regulatory patterns. The therapeutic value of selenium metabolism was explored through machine learning and examined in several immunotherapy cohorts. The heterogeneity and underlying mechanism of selenium metabolism were investigated by cell‒cell communication analysis at the single-cell level.ResultsA GSEA analysis based on 86 genes was used to evaluate the selenium metabolism landscape. The selenium metabolism score exhibited prognostic value in predicting the lower risk of mortality, possibly due to its correlation with multiple cancer hallmarks, including a positive correlation with complement (R = 0.761, P < 0.001), inflammatory response (R = 0.663, P < 0.001), apoptosis (R = 0.626, P < 0.001), hypoxia (R = 0.587, P < 0.001), reactive oxygen species (ROS) (R = 0.558, P < 0.001), and interferon gamma response (R = 0.539, P < 0.001). We also observed heterogeneity in the relationship between selenium metabolism and immunity across different cancers. Based on selenium-related genes, we constructed a machine learning model with area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.82 in predicting immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based immunotherapy response. Single-cell selenium metabolism quantification revealed that adjacent and tumor tissues had higher selenium metabolism compared with normal tissues, especially in epithelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages. The communication between high-selenium epithelium and high-selenium fibroblast was significantly higher than other cells, especially in cytokines, chemokines, collagen, Wnt, VEGF, IGF and FGF pathways.ConclusionOur study provides a comprehensive landscape of selenium metabolism levels and diverse regulatory patterns in different cancers, deepening the understanding of selenium’s roles in tumorigenesis and immunity.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05333-6.",1
"PurposeIn recent times, multiple molecular subtypes with varying prognoses have been identified in bladder cancer (BLCA). However, the attributes of butyrate metabolism-related (BMR) molecular subtypes and their correlation with immunotherapy response remain inadequately explored in BLCA.MethodsWe utilized 594 samples of BLCA to investigate the molecular subtypes mediated by BMR genes and their correlation with the immunotherapy response. To quantify the BMR features of individual tumors, we developed a BMR score through the COX and LASSO regression methods. Clinical-related, tumor microenvironment, drug-sensitive and immunotherapy analyses were used to comprehensively analyze BMR scores.ResultsTwo distinct molecular subtypes related to butyrate metabolism were identified in BLCA, each with unique prognostic implications and immune microenvironments. BMR score was constructed based on 7 BMR genes and was used to classify the patients into two score groups. Clinical analysis revealed that the BMR score was an independent prognostic factor. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. The BMR score can also predict tumor immunity. The results demonstrated that a low BMR score was associated with higher efficacy of immunotherapy, which was also validated by an external dataset.ConclusionOur study proposes both molecular subtypes and a BMR-based score as promising prognostic classifications in BLCA. These findings may offer new insights for the development of precise targeted cancer therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05067-5.","BackgroundThe CD-TK double suicide gene has become an effective therapy for bladder cancer. A novel molecular-targeted ultrasound (US) method has been developed to precisely guide nanobubbles loaded with this gene to regions within bladder tumor cells and is widely used due to its efficiency in delivering drugs to the target tumor.MethodsUniform nanoscaled nanobubbles loaded with CD-TK double suicide gene were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods.ResultsIn the present study, we synthesized CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded cationic nanobubbles conjugated with anti-VEGFR2 that can bind with VEGFR2-positive cells. Fluorescence and flow cytometry evidence show that CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded nanobubbles were successfully developed. CD-TK-CNBs delivered via US-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) enhanced transfection efficiency, overexpression of CD-TK double suicide gene, and tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro.ConclusionsThese CD-TK-CNBs may become a novel treatment for bladder cancer.",1
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent form of gastrointestinal malignancy with challenges in chemotherapy resistance and side effects. Effective and low toxic drugs for CRC treatment are urgently needed. Ferroptosis is a novel mode of cell death, which has garnered attention for its therapeutic potential against cancer. Baicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is the primary flavone extracted from the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis that exhibits anticancer effects against several malignancies including CRC. In this study, we investigated whether baicalein induced ferroptosis in CRC cells. We showed that baicalein (1–64 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the viability of human CRC lines HCT116 and DLD1. Co-treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 (1 μM) significantly mitigated baicalein-induced CRC cell death, whereas autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (25 μM), necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (10 μM), or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (10 μM) did not rescue baicalein-induced CRC cell death. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the inhibitory effect of baicalein on CRC cells is associated with ferroptosis induction. We revealed that baicalein (7.5–30 μM) dose-dependently decreased the expression levels of GPX4, key regulator of ferroptosis, in HCT116 and DLD1 cells by blocking janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway via direct interaction with JAK2, ultimately leading to ferroptosis in CRC cells. In a CRC xenograft mouse model, administration of baicalein (10, 20 mg/kg, i.g., every two days for two weeks) dose-dependently inhibited the tumor growth with significant ferroptosis induced by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 axis in tumor tissue. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis contributes to baicalein-induced anti-CRC activity through blockade of the JAK2/STAT3/GPX4 signaling pathway, which provides evidence for the therapeutic application of baicalein against CRC.","Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody of VEGF, and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death function independently of the apoptotic machinery, has been accepted as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention; the ferroptosis pathway can enhance cell immune activity of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in HCC. In this study we investigated whether and how bevacizumab regulated ferroptosis and immune activity in liver cancer. Firstly, we performed RNA-sequencing in bevacizumab-treated human liver cancer cell line HepG2 cells, and found that bevacizumab significantly altered the expression of a number of genes including VEGF, PI3K, HAT1, SLC7A11 and IL-9 in liver cancer, bevacizumab upregulated 37 ferroptosis-related drivers, and downregulated 17 ferroptosis-related suppressors in particular. We demonstrated that bevacizumab triggered ferroptosis in liver cancer cells by driving VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/SLC7A11 axis. Clinical data confirmed that the expression levels of VEGF were positively associated with those of PI3K, HAT1 and SLC7A11 in HCC tissues. Meanwhile, we found that bevacizumab enhanced immune cell activity in tumor immune-microenvironment. We identified that HAT1 up-regulated miR-143 targeting IL-9 mRNA 3’UTR in liver cancer cells; bevacizumab treatment resulted in the increase of IL-9 levels and its secretion via VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/miR-143/IL-9 axis, which led to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo through increasing the release of IL-2 and Granzyme B from activated CD8+ T cells. We conclude that in addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer. This study provides new insight into the mechanisms by which bevacizumab synergistically modulates ferroptosis and CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer.",1
"ObjectiveImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been validated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, there exists no evidence regarding NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, experiencing EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment failure. We collected clinical information from real world and conducted a time series-based meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations and experienced EGFR-TKIs resistance.MethodsTwenty-two NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations after TKI resistance were included from two hospitals. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literature published until December 31, 2021. Endpoint outcomes included mortality and progression-free survival (PFS) at different times of follow-up.ResultsIn total, 22 patients showed that the median PFS was 5.6 months (range 2.0–9.0 months). According to treatment strategies, the median PFS was 2.4 months (range 2.0–5.3 months) in the ICI monotherapy group and 5.9 months (range 2.8–9.0 months) in the ICI combined Chemotherapy group. Additionally, sixteen studies, including 5 trials, 10 controlled cohorts and 1 real-world study, were assessed, involving a total of ICI-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation after TKI failure. The 6-month survival and PFS rate were 0.82 (95% CI 0.36–0.97) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.34–0.74), respectively. ICI combined chemotherapy showed the best survival outcome among these groups, as demonstrated by the 12-month survival rate and PFS. No new safety signals were identified with the combination therapy. The frequency of treatment-related adverse events was similar to that in previously reported studies of chemotherapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors.ConclusionsThe addition of ICIs plus chemotherapy may significantly improve progression-free survival among patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who EGFR-TKIs resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04176-x.","PurposeExposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can predispose to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) involving the gastrointestinal tract. The association between ICIs and bowel perforation has not been well studied. We aimed to describe the clinical course, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients experiencing bowel perforation during or after ICI treatment.MethodsThis retrospective, single-center study included adult cancer patients with bowel perforation that occurred between the first dose of ICI treatment and up to 1 year thereafter between 1/1/2010 and 4/30/2021. Patients’ clinical course, imaging, treatment, and outcomes related to bowel perforation were collected and analyzed.ResultsOf the 13,991 patients who received ICIs during the study period, 90 (0.6%) met the inclusion criteria. A majority were male (54.4%), the most common cancer type was melanoma (23.3%), and most patients had received PD-1/L1 inhibitor treatment (58.8%). Onset of perforation occurred after a median of four ICI treatment cycles. The most common symptom was abdominal pain (95.5%). The colon was the most common location for the perforation (37.7%). Evidence of diverticulitis, enterocolitis, or appendicitis was seen in 32 (35.6%) patients, and 6 (6.6%) patients had luminal cancer involvement at the time of perforation. The overall hospitalization rate related to perforation was 95.5%, with mortality of 15.5% during the same admission. Antibiotics were given in 95% of our sample; 37.8% of patients also required surgical/interventional radiology intervention. Forty-six patients (51.1%) had perforation-related complications (for example, sepsis, fistula, abscess), which were associated with a higher mortality rate (30%).ConclusionOur findings suggest a low incidence of bowel perforation after ICI treatment (0.6%), with 40% of patients having coexisting bowel inflammation as a potential contributing factor. Patients with bowel perforation had an aggressive disease course and high rates of hospitalization, complications, and mortality. Early recognition and prompt intervention is critical to improve patient outcomes. Future studies are warranted to further investigate the cause, predictive markers, and optimal treatment for this patient population.",1
"ABSTRACTThe SWI/SNF complex is a chromatin remodeling complex comprised by several proteins such as SMARCA4 or SMARCB1. Mutations in its components can lead to the development of aggressive rhabdoid tumors such as epithelioid sarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor or small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type, among others. These malignancies tend to affect young patients and their prognosis is poor given the lack of effective treatments. Characteristically, these tumors are highly infiltrated by TILs, suggesting that some lymphocytes are recognizing tumor antigens. The use of those TILs as a therapeutic strategy is a promising approach worth exploring. Here, we report the clinical protocol of the TILTS study, a Phase II clinical trial assessing personalized adoptive cell therapy with TILs in patients affected by these tumor types.Clinical Trial Registration: 2023-504632-17-00 ( (ClinicalTrials.gov).","The cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP), a bromodomain-containing protein, engages with multiple transcription factors and enhances the activation of many genes. CBP bromodomain acts as an epigenetic reader and plays an important role in the CBP-chromatin interaction which makes it an important drug target for treating many diseases. Though inhibiting CBP bromodomain was reported to have great potential in cancer therapeutics, approved CBP bromodomain inhibitor is yet to come. We utilized various in silico approaches like molecular docking, ADMET, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM-PBSA calculations, and in silico PASS predictions to identify potential CBP bromodomain inhibitors from marine natural compounds as they have been identified as having distinctive chemical structures and greater anticancer activities. To develop a marine natural compound library for this investigation, Lipinski’s rule of five was used. Sequential investigations utilizing molecular docking, ADMET studies, 100 ns MD simulations, and MM-PBSA calculations revealed that three marine compounds—ascididemin, neoamphimedine, and stelletin A—demonstrated superior binding affinity compared to the standard inhibitor, 69 A. These compounds also exhibited suitable drug-like properties, a favorable safety profile, and formed stable protein-ligand complexes. The in-silico PASS tool predicted that these compounds have significant potential for anticancer activity. Among them, ascididemin demonstrated the highest binding affinity in both molecular docking and MM-PBSA calculations, as well as a better stability profile in MD simulations. Hence, ascididemin can be a potential inhibitor of CBP bromodomain. However, in vitro and in vivo validation is required for further confirmation of these findings.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00258-5.",0
"Purpose:There are few markers to identify those likely to recur or progress after treatment with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). We developed and validated artificial intelligence (AI)–based histologic assays that extract interpretable features from transurethral resection of bladder tumor digitized pathology images to predict risk of recurrence, progression, development of BCG-unresponsive disease, and cystectomy.Materials and Methods:Pre-BCG resection-derived whole-slide images and clinical data were obtained for high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer cases treated with BCG from 12 centers and were analyzed through a segmentation and feature extraction pipeline. Features associated with clinical outcomes were defined and tested on independent development and validation cohorts. Cases were classified into high or low risk for recurrence, progression, BCG-unresponsive disease, and cystectomy.Results:Nine hundred forty-four cases (development: 303, validation: 641, median follow-up: 36 months) representative of the intended use population were included (high-grade Ta: 34.1%, high-grade T1: 54.8%; carcinoma in situ only: 11.1%, any carcinoma in situ: 31.4%). In the validation cohort, “high recurrence risk” cases had inferior high-grade recurrence-free survival vs “low recurrence risk” cases (HR, 2.08, P < .0001). “High progression risk” patients had poorer progression-free survival (HR, 3.87, P < .001) and higher risk of cystectomy (HR, 3.35, P < .001) than “low progression risk” patients. Cases harboring the BCG-unresponsive disease signature had a shorter time to development of BCG-unresponsive disease than cases without the signature (HR, 2.31, P < .0001). AI assays provided predictive information beyond clinicopathologic factors.Conclusions:We developed and validated AI-based histologic assays that identify high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer cases at higher risk of recurrence, progression, BCG-unresponsive disease, and cystectomy, potentially aiding clinical decision making.","AbstractAs cancer patients with intracranial metastatic disease experience increasingly prolonged survival, the diagnosis and management of recurrent brain metastasis pose significant challenges in clinical practice. Prior to deciding upon a management strategy, it is necessary to ascertain whether patients have recurrent/progressive disease vs adverse radiation effect, classify the recurrence as local or distant in the brain, evaluate the extent of intracranial disease (size, number and location of lesions, and brain metastasis velocity), the status of extracranial disease, and enumerate the interval from the last intracranially directed intervention to disease recurrence. A spectrum of salvage local treatment options includes surgery (resection and laser interstitial thermal therapy [LITT]) with or without adjuvant radiotherapy in the forms of external beam radiotherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. Nonoperative salvage local treatments also range from single fraction and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS/FSRS) to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Optimal integration of systemic therapies, preferably with central nervous system (CNS) activity, may also require reinterrogation of brain metastasis tissue to identify actionable molecular alterations specific to intracranial progressive disease. Ultimately, the selection of the appropriate management approach necessitates a sophisticated understanding of patient, tumor, and prior treatment-related factors and is often multimodal; hence, interdisciplinary evaluation for such patients is indispensable.",1
"PurposeThe aim of the study was to construct a risk score model based on m6A-related targets to predict overall survival and immunotherapy response in ovarian cancer.MethodsThe gene expression profiles of 24 m6A regulators were extracted. Survival analysis screened 9 prognostic m6A regulators. Next, consensus clustering analysis was applied to identify clusters of ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, 47 phenotype-related differentially expressed genes, strongly correlated with 9 prognostic m6A regulators, were screened and subjected to univariate and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. Ultimately, a nomogram was constructed which presented a strong ability to predict overall survival in ovarian cancer.ResultsCBLL1, FTO, HNRNPC, METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, ZC3H13, RBM15B and YTHDC2 were associated with worse overall survival (OS) in ovarian cancer. Three m6A clusters were identified, which were highly consistent with the three immune phenotypes. What is more, a risk model based on seven m6A-related targets was constructed with distinct prognosis. In addition, the low-risk group is the best candidate population for immunotherapy.ConclusionWe comprehensively analyzed the m6A modification landscape of ovarian cancer and detected seven m6A-related targets as an independent prognostic biomarker for predicting survival. Furthermore, we divided patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct prognosis and select the optimum population which may benefit from immunotherapy and constructed a nomogram to precisely predict ovarian cancer patients’ survival time and visualize the prediction results.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04162-3.","BackgroundIncreasing studies have demonstrated the biological function of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in tumorigenesis. However, the potential role of m6A modifications in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.MethodsHerein, 23 m6A regulators were fetched and introduced into consensus clustering to identify distinct m6A modification patterns and develop m6A-based molecular signatures. Then, a principal component analysis algorithm was employed to construct an m6A-based scoring system to further quantify m6A modification patterns in individual tumors. Immunophenoscore (IPS) was used to estimate the immunotherapeutic response of patients.ResultsThree different m6A modification patterns with distinct prognoses and biological signatures were identified among 611 HCC samples. The TIME characteristics of these three patterns were consistent with three known immune profiles: immune-oasis, immune-excluded, and immune-inflamed phenotypes. Identifying m6A modification patterns within individual tumors based on the m6Ascore, developed under the m6A-related signature genes, contributed to elaborating biological processes, clinical outcomes, immune cell infiltration, immunotherapeutic effects, and genetic variations. The low-m6Ascore subtype, characterized by immunosuppression, suggested an immune-suppressed phenotype and a low probability of benefiting from immunotherapy. Finally, the potential function of PRDM4 in HCC was explored.ConclusionThis study comprehensively elucidated the indispensable role of m6A modification patterns in the complexity of TIME. The quantitative identification of m6A modification patterns in individual tumors will contribute to optimizing precision immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04255-z.",1
"AbstractBackground:B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy yield remarkable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/RMM). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) reportedly exhibits distinct advantages in addressing the challenges posed by tumor heterogeneity in the distribution and genetic variations in R/RMM.Methods:Herein, the ctDNA of 108 peripheral blood plasma samples from patients with R/RMM at the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University was thoroughly investigated before administration of anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy to establish its predictive potential. Flow cytometry is used primarily to detect subgroups of T cells or CAR-T cells.Results:In this study, several tumor and T cell effector-mediated factors were considered to be related to treatment failure by an integrat analysis, including higher percentages of multiple myeloma (MM) cells in the bone marrow (P = 0.0125), lower percentages of CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood at peak (P = 0.0375), and higher percentages of CD8+ T cells (P = 0.0340). Furthermore, there is a substantial correlation between high ctDNA level (>143 ng/mL) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.007). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high levels of ctDNA (>143 ng/mL), MM-driven high-risk mutations (including IGLL5 [P = 0.004], IRF4 [P = 0.024], and CREBBP [P = 0.041]), number of multisite mutations, and resistance-related mutation (ERBB4, P = 0.040) were independent risk factors for PFS.Conclusion:Finally, a ctDNA-based risk model was built based on the above independent risk factors, which serves as an adjunct non-invasive measure of substantial tumor burden and a prognostic genetic feature that can assist in predicting the response to anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy.Registeration:Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100046474) and National Clinical Trial (NCT04670055, NCT05430945).","PurposeCell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma enables rapid and repeat testing of actionable mutations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an attractive platform for multiplex sequencing capabilities compared to traditional methods such as PCR. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of the NGS-based ctDNA assay and to identify the genomic alteration profile of ctDNA in real-world Chinese non-small cell lung (NSCLC) patients.MethodsIn total, 294 Chinese patients with pathological diagnosis of Phase III-IV NSCLC were enrolled. 3–4 mL peripheral blood was collected and NGS-based analysis was carried out using a 20-gene panel. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA NGS-based assay was validated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).ResultsWe have tested 570 sites from 286 samples using ddPCR, which included 108 positive sites and 462 negative sites from NGS results, and the concordance rate was 99.8% (418/419) for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 96.7% (146/151) for insertions and deletions (InDels). The most frequent genes were TP53 (32%), EGFR (31.97%), KRAS (6.46%), PIK3CA (4.76%), and MET (4.08%). Exon 19 deletion (19del) was the most common alteration in EGFR and G12C was the most common alteration in KRAS. Furthermore, the detection rate of TP53 was higher in the male and patients with squamous cell carcinoma. We also found the prevalence of TP53 in L858R was higher than in 19del (61.29% vs. 40%; p = 0.1115).ConclusionThe results indicate that the results of NGS-based ctDNA assay are highly consistent with ddPCR. In Chinese NSCLC patients, TP53 mutation was more frequently associated with male and squamous cell carcinoma. The prevalence of concomitant mutations in L858R may be different from that in 19del.",1
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a very promising novel class of immune response-regulating drugs for cancer treatment. Hypophysitis is one of their most common immune-related adverse events, occurring in a significant proportion of patients. Since this is a potentially severe entity, regular hormone monitoring is recommended during treatment to allow for a timely diagnosis and adequate treatment. Identification of clinical signs and symptoms, such as headaches, fatigue, weakness, nausea and dizziness, can also be key for its recognition. Compressive symptoms, such as visual disturbances, are uncommon, as is diabetes insipidus. Imaging findings are usually mild and transient and can easily go unnoticed. However, the presence of pituitary abnormalities in imaging studies should prompt closer monitoring, as these can precede clinical manifestations. The clinical importance of this entity relates mainly to the risk of hormone deficiency, especially ACTH, which occurs in the majority of patients and is rarely reversible, requiring lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy.","PurposeThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tumor tracking hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the twelve cases of unresectable HCC with tumor thrombus in the main trunk or first branch of the portal vein that were treated with MRI-guided tumor tracking HFRT or SBRT using the ViewRay Linac MRIdian system between June 2019 and January 2021. The HFRT was performed with a total of 50 Gy in 10 fractions, and SBRT performed in a range of 36–50 Gy with 4–5 fractions. The median biologic effective dose (BED) with an a/b ratio of 10 was 75 Gy10 (range 68.4–100 Gy10).ResultsThe median follow-up duration was 5.0 months (range 1.9–12.8 months). Ten patients (83.3%) showed an objective response of PVTT. At the time of analysis, ten patients (83.3%) showed local control. The 1-year intrahepatic control rate was 48.9%. Three patients (25%) showed mild gastrointestinal symptoms, and there were no cases of grade 3 or higher toxicity. For hepatic toxicity, there were no cases in which the Child–Pugh score increased by more than two points after RT without disease progression.ConclusionMRI-guided tumor tracking HFRT and SBRT was a feasible, effective, and safe treatment option in HCC patients with tumor thrombi in the main trunk or first branch of the portal vein.",0
"IntroductionTumor immunotherapy has recently emerged as a crucial focal point in oncology treatment research. Among tumor immunotherapy approaches, tumor immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have attracted substantial attention in clinical research. However, this treatment modality has benefitted only a limited number of patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of various biomarkers to decipher their prognostic implications in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who are treated with ICIs, and thus identify predictive markers with practical clinical relevance.MethodsA systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify clinical studies that examined the correlation between biomarkers and treatment outcomes in the HNSCC patients. The included articles were screened and analyzed to extract data regarding overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).ResultsThe relationship between the biomarkers included in the summary and prognosis was as follows: HPV positivity was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58–1.99), PFS (HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.81–1.67), and response (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.37–2.99). PD-L1 positivity was associated with OS (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.59–0.85), PFS (HR = 0.56 95% CI = 0.43–0.73), and response (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.51–3.10). Neither HPV positivity nor PD-L1 positivity was associated with DCR. The following markers were collected for OS and PFS data and were associated with longer OS: lower Glasgow prognostic score (GPS/mGPS) grading, lower PS grading, high body mass index (BMI), low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), low platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), high albumin (Alb), low lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Factors associated with better PFS were lower GPS/mGPS grading, lower PS grading, high BMI, low NLR, high absolute lymphocyte count, and low LDH. Hyperprogressive disease was associated with worse OS and PFS. Fewer clinical studies have been completed on the tumor microenvironment and hypoxia, microsatellite instability/DNA mismatch repair, and microbiome and systematic analysis is difficult.ConclusionIn our meta-analysis, different immune checkpoint factors were associated with different prognoses in HNSCC patients receiving immunotherapy. HPV, PD-L1, BMI, Alb, HPD, PS, GPS/mGPS, LDH, NLR, and PLR predicted the ICI outcome in HNSCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05504-5.","IntroductionReceptor/ligand pair immune checkpoints are inhibitors that regulate immunity as vital “Don’t Find-Me” signals to the adaptive immune system, additionally, the essential goals of anti-cancer therapy. Moreover, the immune checkpoints are involved in treatment resistance in cancer therapy. The immune checkpoints as a signal from “self” and their expression on healthy cells prevent phagocytosis. Cells (for example, senescent and/or apoptotic cells) with low immune checkpoints, such as low CD47 and/or PD-L1, are phagocytosed, which is necessary for tissue integrity and homeostasis maintenance. In other words, cancer cells induce increased CD47 expression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), avoiding their clearance by immune cells. PD-L1 and/or CD47 expression tumors have also been employed as biomarkers to guide cure prospects. Thus, targeting innate and adaptive immune checkpoints might improve the influence of the treatments on tumor cells. However, the CD47 regulation in the TME stands intricate, so much of this process has stayed a riddle. In this line, less attention has been paid to cytokines in TME. Cytokines are significant regulators of tumor immune surveillance, and they do this by controlling the actions of the immune cell. Recently, it has been suggested that different types of cytokines at TME might cooperate with others that contribute to the regulation of CD47 and/or PD-L1.Materials and methodsThe data were searched in available databases and a Web Search engine (PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) using related keywords in the title, abstract, and keywords.ConclusionGiven the significant role of pro/anti-inflammatory signaling in the TME, we discuss the present understanding of pro/anti-inflammatory signaling implications in “Don’t Eat-Me” regulation signals, particularly CD47, in the pathophysiology of cancers and come up with innovative opinions for the clinical transformation and personalized medicine.",1
"PurposeThis phase I clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell generated by the piggyBac transposon system in advanced relapsed/refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Compared to viral systems, the piggyBac transposon system is a simpler, more economical, and alternative way to introduce chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgenes into T cells.MethodsThis study recruited nine patients with advanced relapsed/refractory EGFR-positive NSCLC for two cycles of the piggyBac-generated EGFR-CAR T cells at dose of 1 × 106 cells/kg or 3 × 106 cells/kg of body weight. The patients were monitored for adverse events, clinical response, and persistence of plasma GFR-CAR T cells.ResultsInfusions of piggyBac-generated EGFR-CAR T cells were well tolerated in all nine patients. The most common adverse events were grade 1 to 3 fever and there were no patients who experienced grade 4 adverse events or serious cytokine release syndrome. After treatment, eight of nine patients showed detectable EGFR-CAR T cells in their peripheral blood. One patient showed a partial response and lasted for more than 13 months, while six had stable disease, and two had progressed disease. The progression-free survival of these nine patients was 7.13 months (95% CI 2.71–17.10 months), while the median overall survival was 15.63 months (95% CI 8.82–22.03 months).ConclusionThis Phase I clinical trial revealed that the non-viral piggyBac transposon system-engineered EGFR-CAR T-cell therapy is feasible and safe in treatment of EGFR-positive advanced relapsed/refractory NSCLC patients. Future study will assess it in more patients or even possibly with a higher dose.Trial registration number NCT03182816.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03613-7.","BackgroundThe use of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with other anti-cancer agents was a priority for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with considerable PD-L1 expression. However, studies seldom show the progression of liver metastases after using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).MethodsData were obtained from the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care of Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Military Medical University. In the present study, we analyzed five non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had liver metastases after they were treated with pembrolizumab between 2019 and 2021. All of them had both stable primary lesions and liver progression with pembrolizumab intervention. Blood laboratory tests and imaging examinations were performed regularly during the treatment to assess the tumor responses of patients.ResultsAll patients displayed reduction or stability in the initial lesions as a result, but they also experienced the emergence of metastatic liver locations, which were regularly detected throughout immunotherapy. Additionally, the appearance of liver metastasis weakened their liver function gradually with the escalation of carcinoembryonic antigen, regarded as a predictor for evaluating the progression of tumors. These individuals were highly distinctive with hyper-progressive diseases associated with immunotherapy. We drew individualized intervention schemes for metastatic lesions in each patient and found that their life expectancy shared no significance given the restricting subjected population.ConclusionsOur study indicated a clinical phenomenon after using immune checkpoint inhibitors and presented a necessity for implementing large scales clinical studies to manage NSCLC-oriented liver metastasis.",1
"The utilization of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, specifically anti-PD-1/L1 agents, prior to radical cystectomy is an emerging paradigm in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). In situ vaccination represents a strategy to manipulate the tumor in order to augment the immune response toward improved local and distant cancer control. The authors describe the study rationale, design and objectives for RAD VACCINE MIBC, a single-arm, single-institution, phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of combination neoadjuvant sasanlimab (humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1) with stereotactic body radiotherapy as an in situ vaccine in cisplatin-ineligible patients with MIBC. The results from this trial will establish the safety profile of this combination strategy and evaluate pathologic complete response rates.","Background and aimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and deadly disease with limited treatment options. Regorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promise in HCC treatment but faces limitations as a monotherapy. Combining regorafenib with PD-1 inhibitor may improve efficacy and survival outcomes for patients. This retrospective analysis was conducted to explore its efficacy and safety, providing reference experience for better application of this combination therapy.MethodsThis retrospective single-center study evaluated the efficacy and safety of combining regorafenib with PD-1 blockade for patients with HCC. Efficacy was evaluated according to the RECIST 1.1 evaluation criteria. Safety was assessed using CTCAE 4.0. Data was analyzed to compare survival status in different subgroups.ResultsGenerally, there were 76 patients with HCC elected to receive the regorafenib plus PD-1 blockade treatment during the study period. The objective response rate was 21.1% (n = 16), and the disease control rate was 56.6% (n = 43). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.8 months, and median overall survival had not yet been reached. All patients suffered of at least 1 adverse event. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 31.6% of patients (n = 24), with the most common being hand-foot syndrome, decreased appetite, and abdominal distension. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in PFS based on cirrhosis status or previous treatment lines.ConclusionWith manageable safety, regorafenib combined PD-1 inhibitor could bring survival benefits for advanced HCC who have received systemic treatment. Further, the Cox analysis showed that HBV infection, metastasis, etc. did not have significant effects on the survival benefits.",1
"Aim: We aimed to investigate the predictive value of the Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) expression from circulating blood for recurrence, metastasis and overall death on patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Materials & Methods: We collected blood samples from 122 patients who were admitted to our hospital for NSCLC.Results: Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis in adjusted Model II showed that compared with GRHL2-negative expression, positive expression in patients with NSCLC was associated with increased death risk (HR = 7.0, 95% CI: 2.1–20.9, p = 0.03) and risk for composite end point (HR = 8.2, 95% CI: 4.0–27.1, p <0.01).Conclusion: This study supported that elevated circulating GRHL2 expression might be considered as a candidate prognostic biomarker for poor prognosis among these NSCLC patients.","Background:In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) revolution is rapidly moving from metastatic to early-stage, however, the impact of clinicopathological variables and optimal treatment sequencing remain unclear.Methods:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with ICI as single agent or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (PCT) were included. Primary outcomes were pathological complete response (pCR), event free survival (EFS) (neoadjuvant/perioperative), and disease-free survival (DFS) (adjuvant). Secondary outcomes were major pathological response (MPR), overall survival (OS), toxicity, surgical outcomes (neoadjuvant/perioperative); OS and toxicity (adjuvant). An additional secondary endpoint was to compare EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative strategies.Results:8 RCTs (2 neoadjuvant, 4 perioperative, 2 adjuvant) (4661 participants) were included. Neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI+PCT significantly improved pCR, EFS, OS, MPR and R0 resection compared to PCT. Adjuvant ICI significantly improved DFS compared to placebo. There was a significant subgroup interaction by PD-L1 status (χ2 = 10.72, P = 0.005), pCR (χ2 = 17.80, P < 0.0001), and stage (χ2 = 4.46, P = 0.003) for EFS. No difference according to PD-L1 status was found for pCR, with 14% of patients having PD-L1 negative tumors still experiencing a pCR. No interaction by PD-L1 status was found for DFS upon adjuvant ICI. Indirect comparison showed no difference in EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative ICI+PCT.Conclusions:PD-L1 status, pCR and stage impact on survival upon neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI. The restriction of neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI to PD-L1 + patients could preclude pCR and long-term benefit in the PD-L1-subgroup. Neoadjuvant and perioperative could be equivalent strategies.",0
"BackgroundOvarian cancer (OvCa) is the most lethal of the gynecologic malignancies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have revolutionized the treatment of multiple malignancies, have had limited efficacy in OvCa patients. This lack of effectiveness is partly due to the abnormal ovarian tumor microenvironment (TME), displaying a desmoplastic, highly fibrotic extracellular matrix. High extracellular matrix deposition leads to a buildup of compressive forces that cause tumor blood vessel collapse, reduced vessel perfusion, poor delivery of drugs, and compromised trafficking of cytotoxic T-cells to these tumors.MethodsUsing two syngeneic OvCa models, we tested the effect of losartan, a widely prescribed anti-hypertensive drug, on reprogramming the TME and chemosensitizing the cancer cells.ResultsLosartan treatment (i) reprograms the TME leading to increased vascular perfusion, and thus enhances drug delivery and immune effector cell intratumoral infiltration and function; and (ii) rewires the OvCa cells by suppressing the IGF-1 signaling, resulting in enhanced chemosensitivity. As a result of the combined tumor and stromal effects, losartan treatment enhances the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in OvCa models.ConclusionThe safety and low cost ( < $1-2/day) of losartan warrant rapid translation of our findings to patients with OvCa.","BackgroundOvarian cancer patients’ resistance to first-line treatment posed a significant challenge, with approximately 70% experiencing recurrence and developing strong resistance to first-line chemotherapies like paclitaxel.ObjectivesWithin the framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM), this study aimed to use artificial intelligence to find drug resistance characteristics at the single cell, and further construct the classification strategy and deep learning prognostic models based on these resistance traits, which can better facilitate and perform 3PM.MethodsThis study employed “Beyondcell,” an algorithm capable of predicting cellular drug responses, to calculate the similarity between the expression patterns of 21,937 cells from ovarian cancer samples and the signatures of 5201 drugs to identify drug-resistance cells. Drug resistance features were used to perform 10 multi-omics clustering on the TCGA training set to identify patient subgroups with differential drug responses. Concurrently, a deep learning prognostic model with KAN architecture which had a flexible activation function to better fit the model was constructed for this training set. The constructed patient subtype classifier and prognostic model were evaluated using three external validation sets from GEO: GSE17260, GSE26712, and GSE51088.ResultsThis study identified that endothelial cells are resistant to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and docetaxel, suggesting their potential as targets for cellular therapy in ovarian cancer patients. Based on drug resistance features, 10 multi-omics clustering identified four patient subtypes with differential responses to four chemotherapy drugs, in which subtype CS2 showed the highest drug sensitivity to all four drugs. The other subtypes also showed enrichment in different biological pathways and immune infiltration, allowing for targeted treatment based on their characteristics. Besides, this study applied the latest KAN architecture in artificial intelligence to replace the MLP structure in the DeepSurv prognostic model, finally demonstrating robust performance on patients’ prognosis prediction.ConclusionsThis study, by classifying patients and constructing prognostic models based on resistance characteristics to first-line drugs, has effectively applied multi-omics data into the realm of 3PM.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-024-00374-4.",1
"PurposeThe aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical impact of skeletal muscle area (SMA) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors.MethodsUnivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on data of 103 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors. The SMA was measured at the level of the third lumbar vertebral (L3) on computed tomography images using OsiriX software (32-bit, version 5.8; OsiriX, Geneva, Switzerland). The L3 muscle index (cm2/m2) was defined as the SMA (cm2) at the L3 level divided by the height (m) squared.ResultsL3 muscle index Low was an independent predictor of both progression-free (P = 0.0399) and overall survival (P = 0.0155). Moreover, the disease control rate was significantly lower in the L3 muscle index Low group (49.0% [25/51]) than in the L3 muscle index High group (73.1% [38/52]; P = 0.0117). However, there was no significant difference between the response rates of the L3 muscle index Low group (21.6% [11/51]) and L3 muscle index High group (32.7% [17/52]; P = 0.2031).ConclusionsL3 muscle index Low is an independent predictor of worse outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03146-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody are promising treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but lack reliable biomarkers of response. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between pre-treatment body composition measures (muscle, adipose, etc.) and the prognosis of patients with HCC treated with ICIs.MethodsWe measured the total area of all skeletal muscles, total adipose tissue area, subcutaneous adipose tissue area, and visceral adipose tissue area at the level of the third lumbar vertebra using quantitative CT. Then, we calculated the skeletal muscle index, visceral adipose tissue index, subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI), and total adipose tissue index. The Cox regression model was used to determine the independent factors of the patient prognosis and construct a nomogram to predict survival. The consistency index (C-index) and calibration curve were used to determine the predictive accuracy and discrimination ability of the nomogram.ResultsMultivariate analysis revealed that the SATI (high- vs. low SATI; HR 0.251; 95% CI 0.109–0.577; P = 0.001), sarcopenia (sarcopenia vs. no sarcopenia; HR 2.171; 95% CI 1.100–4.284; P = 0.026), and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) (PVTT vs. No PVTT; HR 2.429; 95% CI 1. 197–4. 929; P = 0.014) were indicated as independent prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis indicated that Child–Pugh class (HR 0.477, 95% CI 0.257–0.885, P = 0.019) and sarcopenia (HR 2.376, 95% CI 1.335–4.230, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors of PFS. We established a nomogram using SATI, SA, and PVTT to predict the 12-month and 18-month survival probability of HCC patients treated with ICIs. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.754 (95% CI 0.686–0.823), and the calibration curve confirmed that the predicted results were in good agreement with the actual observations.ConclusionSubcutaneous adipose and sarcopenia are significant prognostic factors of patients with HCC receiving ICIs. A nomogram based on body composition parameters and clinical factors could well predict survival in HCC patients treated with ICIs.",1
"PurposeItraconazole is an antifungal drug that has been clinically used for over 30 years. In recent years, scholars have discovered that it possesses an anticancer effect. Moreover, its mechanism has been clarified to some degree. What deserves to be mentioned is that itraconazole acting on the Hedgehog pathway has made a new progress in the treatment of cancers. While interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the Hedgehog pathway is largely activated in different cancer cells.ResultThis review tries to highlight the effect of itraconazole on smoothened receptor (SMO) in the Hedgehog pathway, thereby reducing the glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) release and finally exhibiting a range of anticancer effects, promoting apoptosis of cancer cells, and inhibiting proliferation by indirect inhibition of NF-κB pathway and inflammation, moreover, promoting the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, inhibiting the expression of target genes transcribed by GLI such as BCL-2 and Cyclin-D1. Besides, itraconazole increases the number of Bnip3, subsequently, inducing the dissociation of the Beclin-1/BCL-2 binding complex, as a result of ultimately promoting autophagy of cancer cells.ConclusionAs a new anticancer drug, whether itraconazole eventually entering clinical application requires the joint eforts of all scholars. In any case, an in-depth study on itraconazole will bring new hope for cancer patients in the near future.","This Pillars of Immunology article is a commentary on “A subset of CD4+ thymocytes selected by MHC class I molecules,” a pivotal article by A.

"AbstractGlioblastoma is an aggressive tumor for which median survival remains 14-18 months despite aggressive standard of care. Cellular immunotherapy approaches have recently shown promise. Homologous antigenic loading is an ex-vivo technique that leverages p38MAPK and mTORC1 signaling cascades to initiate powerful cDC1-like skewing in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, leading to downstream induction of tissue-infiltrating, cytolytic effector memory T-cells. This open-label phase I clinical trial evaluated the autologous dendritic cell vaccine DOC1021 prepared through homologous antigenic loading and administered bilaterally near the deep cervical lymph nodes. Three courses of vaccine were administered every 2 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, adjuvanted concurrently with six weeks of weekly type I interferon. Four dose levels from 3.5x106 to 3.6x107 total vaccine cells were tested. Tumor progression prior to vaccination was not an exclusion criterion. Sixteen newly diagnosed IDH-WT patients completed treatment, median age 63 years and 94% MGMTp unmethylated. The most common related AEs were grade 1 injection-site reactions and grade 1-3 fatigue and urticaria. No DLTs were observed. Immunohistochemistry of tumors derived from early post-vaccination second resections showed enhanced CD8+ T-cell infiltration and pathologic findings consistent with residual rather than relapsed GBM in 2/3 patients. Analysis of post-vaccination PBMC in dose level cohorts 2-4 indicated expansion of both CD4+ (13/13) and CD8+ (11/13) central memory T-cell compartments (p<0.002 and p<0.05, respectively) as well as expansion of CD8+CD127+ T-cells (12/13; p<0.001). Among three patients for whom tissue was obtained pre- and post-vaccination, clinical outcomes correlated with Visium spatial transcriptomic analysis. Median survival for the MGMTp unmethylated cohort (n=15) has not yet been reached but is statistically greater (p<0.05) than that of matched historic controls. The results indicate that DOC1021 is safe, can be effectively integrated within existing standards of care and is potentially efficacious in a challenging patient population.","The emerging field of cancer neuroscience reshapes our understanding of the intricate relationship between the nervous system and cancer biology; this new paradigm is likely to fundamentally change and advance neuro-oncological care. The profound interplay between cancers and the nervous system is reciprocal: Cancer growth can be induced and regulated by the nervous system; conversely, tumors can themselves alter the nervous system. Such crosstalk between cancer cells and the nervous system is evident in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Recent advances have uncovered numerous direct neuron-cancer interactions at glioma-neuronal synapses, paracrine mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment, and indirect neuroimmune interactions. Neurosurgeons have historically played a central role in neuro-oncological care, and as the field of cancer neuroscience is becoming increasingly established, the role of neurosurgical intervention is becoming clearer. Examples include peripheral denervation procedures, delineation of neuron-glioma networks, development of neuroprostheses, neuromodulatory procedures, and advanced local delivery systems. The present review seeks to highlight key cancer neuroscience mechanisms with neurosurgical implications and outline the future role of neurosurgical intervention in cancer neuroscience.",0
"Pancreas, a vital organ with intricate endocrine and exocrine functions, is central to the regulation of the body's glucose levels and digestive processes. Disruptions in its endocrine functions, primarily regulated by islets of Langerhans, can lead to debilitating diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Murine models of pancreatic dysfunction have contributed significantly to the understanding of insulitis, islet-relevant immunological responses, and the optimization of cell therapies. However, genetic differences between mice and humans have severely limited their clinical translational relevance. Recent advancements in tissue engineering and microfabrication have ushered in a new era of in vitro models that offer a promising solution. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art engineered tools designed to study endocrine dysfunction of the pancreas. Islet on a chip devices that allow precise control of various culture conditions and noninvasive readouts of functional outcomes have led to the generation of physiomimetic niches for primary and stem cell derived islets. Live pancreatic slices are a new experimental tool that could more comprehensively recapitulate the complex cellular interplay between the endocrine and exocrine parts of the pancreas. Although a powerful tool, live pancreatic slices require more complex control over their culture parameters such as local oxygenation and continuous removal of digestive enzymes and cellular waste products for maintaining experimental functionality over long term. The combination of islet-immune and slice on chip strategies can guide the path toward the next generation of pancreatic tissue modeling for better understanding and treatment of endocrine pancreatic dysfunctions.","AbstractTraditional vaccines have played an important role in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, but they still have problems such as low immunogenicity, poor stability, and difficulty in inducing lasting immune responses. In recent years, the nucleic acid vaccine has emerged as a relatively cheap and safe new vaccine. Compared with traditional vaccines, nucleic acid vaccine has some unique advantages, such as easy production and storage, scalability, and consistency between batches. However, the direct administration of naked nucleic acid vaccine is not ideal, and safer and more effective vaccine delivery systems are needed. With the rapid development of nanocarrier technology, the combination of gene therapy and nanodelivery systems has broadened the therapeutic application of molecular biology and the medical application of biological nanomaterials. Nanoparticles can be used as potential drug-delivery vehicles for the treatment of hereditary and infectious diseases. In addition, due to the advantages of lung immunity, such as rapid onset of action, good efficacy, and reduced adverse reactions, pulmonary delivery of nucleic acid vaccine has become a hot spot in the field of research. In recent years, lipid nanocarriers have become safe, efficient, and ideal materials for vaccine delivery due to their unique physical and chemical properties, which can effectively reduce the toxic side effects of drugs and achieve the effect of slow release and controlled release, and there have been a large number of studies using lipid nanocarriers to efficiently deliver target components into the body. Based on the delivery of tuberculosis (TB) nucleic acid vaccine by lipid carrier, this article systematically reviews the advantages and mechanism of liposomes as a nucleic acid vaccine delivery carrier, so as to lay a solid foundation for the faster and more effective development of new anti-TB vaccine delivery systems in the future.",0
"PurposeThe risk factors and clinical characteristics of ICI-induced immune-mediated hepatotoxicity (IMH) are not fully understood. Thus, the present study sought to clarify the clinical features of IMH.MethodsAll patients treated with ICIs between September 2014 and April 2019 at our institution were included. Clinical data were retrospectively collected from medical records. The frequency of grade ≥ 2 liver damage, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for developing IMH were examined.ResultsOverall, 250 patients (median age 71 years; range 30–87 years; 202 males and 48 females) were included in the analyses. Forty-five patients had elevated transaminase levels (> threefold the upper limit of normal). Of these, 21 were considered to have IMH. The remaining 24 patients had other causes of elevated transaminase levels. Steroids were administered to 13/21 patients with IMH. Although all patients exhibited improvement, IMH was not associated with the anticancer efficacy of the ICIs or OS. A multivariable analysis revealed that IMH was significantly associated with malignant melanoma (odds ratio [OR] 11.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5–38.0; P = 0.0002) and ipilimumab–nivolumab combination therapy (OR 61.2; 95% CI 7.9–1275.3; P < 0.0001).ConclusionImmune-mediated hepatotoxicity occurred in 9.5% of patients treated with ICIs. Appropriate therapeutic interventions are important to avoid affecting the patient’s prognosis, and accurate diagnosis of IMH is essential for this purpose. The frequency of IMH varied according to the type of cancer and the drug used, and was significantly higher in patients with malignant melanoma and in patients given ipilimumab–nivolumab combination therapy.","Objective.HER2 is an important prognostic and therapeutic target in uterine serous carcinoma (USC). Optimal HER2 testing platforms have not been defined and guidelines for testing have changed over time. Our objective is to assess the concordance of HER2 positivity based on chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and next generation sequencing (NGS) and to determine the rate of downstream mutations that may affect response to HER2 directed therapy.Methods.Utilizing the Caris tumor registry, 2192 USC tumors were identified and analyzed using NGS (NextSeq, 592 Genes and WES, NovaSEQ), IHC, and CISH. PD-L1 expression was tested by IHC. Microsatellite instability was tested by fragment analysis, IHC, and NGS. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was measured by totaling somatic mutations per tumor. HER2 positivity through IHC and CISH was determined based on 2007 and 2018 ASCO/CAP HER2 breast cancer guidelines.Results.There was a higher rate of HER2 positivity by IHC when using the 2018 guidelines compared to the 2007 guidelines (16.3% vs 12.3%). Concordance between IHC and CISH was 98.9%. ERBB2 amplification was identified by NGS in 10.5% of tumors. Compared to CISH results, this corresponds to a concordance rate of 91.6% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 60.3%. Single gene alterations in HER2 amplified tumors that may implicate HER2 therapy resistance included PI3K (33.1%), KRAS (2.5%), and PTEN (1.3%).Conclusions.There was high concordance between HER2 positivity based on CISH and IHC. Rate of HER2 positivity is the lowest by NGS. Ultimately these testing platforms need to be validated by response to targeted therapy.",0
"AbstractThe programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) acts as a central inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor. The soluble form of its primary ligand, sPD-L1, was found to be elevated in the serum of patients with cancer, infectious diseases, and chronic inflammation. So far, the hepatic origin of sPD-L1 has received relatively little attention and is therefore the subject of this study in the context of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of liver grafts. sPD-L1 concentrations as well as several well-established clinically relevant laboratory parameters were determined in the perfusate of 16 donor liver grafts undergoing NMP up to 30 hours. sPD-L1 levels continuously increased during NMP and significantly correlated with markers of hepatic synthesis (cholinesterase), acute-phase proteins (von Willebrand factor, procalcitonin, antithrombin, interleukin-6, fibrinogen), and liver decay markers (gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase). Perfusate leukocytes were in the lower reference range and decreased after 12 hours. Mean sPD-L1 levels in the perfusate correlated with donor levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. Our study reveals a significant increase in the concentration of sPD-L1 following ischemia-reperfusion injury in a hepatic ex vivo model. sPD-L1 concentrations during NMP correlate with established acute-phase proteins and liver cell decay markers, suggesting that hepatic sPD-L1 synthesis or shedding increases during the acute phase and cell decay. Furthermore, sPD-L1 correlates with established liver function and synthesis parameters as well as with donor laboratory values and might therefore be a potential biomarker for the hepatic function of liver grafts.","ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore the key oncogenic factor of metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MethodsWe utilized four differential GEO datasets (GSE164760, GSE139602, GSE197112, and GSE49541) to identify the key oncogenic factor for MASH-related HCC. The differential genes were analyzed using the GEO2R algorithm online. The GEPIA online website was used to explore the expression of selected four genes (SPP1, GNMT, CLDN11, and THBS2). The genetic alterations in genes were estimated by the cBioPortal website. The Kaplan-Meier Plotter online database was applied to explore the prognostic value of SPP1. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were carried out to further confirm the prognostic value of SPP1. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis exported associated pathways with SPP1 expression. The positively or negatively related immune cells and immune checkpoint expressions were identified through Pearson correlation analysis. The lipogenesis-associated proteins were detected using western blotting and fluorescence. The high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model was constructed, and liver samples were collected.ResultsSPP1, GNMT, CLDN11, and THBS2 were determined in the transformation process of MASH to liver fibrosis. SPP1 and GNMT were upregulated in the HCC tumor tissue. SPP1, in particular, had the potential to be the prognostic factor through Cox analysis. Remarkably, SPP1 was highly expressed in HCC compared to normal tissues in three independent datasets (GSE121248, GSE14520, and GSE45267). SPP1 is mainly involved in the amplification and deep deletion mutations. SPP1 was found to be strongly correlated with ANXA2 expression, and ANXA2 was also highly expressed in HCC with significant prognostic performance. Moreover, SPP1 was found to participate in the carcinogenic mechanism and correlate with immune cells and immune checkpoint expression. SPP1 knockdown suppressed the SREBP1 and FASN expressions and increased the SIRT1 expression in vitro. Moreover, the HFD model validated the upregulation of SPP1 in the fatty liver in vivo.ConclusionSPP1 may be the key oncogenic factor for the transformation of MASH to HCC, and it could be a potential immunotherapeutic target in HCC.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown limited success in patients with solid tumors. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have shown that adrenoceptor beta-2 (ADRB2) is a novel checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. To inhibit ADRB2-mediated inhibitory signaling, we downregulated ADRB2 in CAR-T (shβ2-CAR-T) cells via RNA interference, assessed different parameters, and compared them with conventional second-generation CAR-T cells. ADRB2 knockdown CAR-T cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, by increasing CD69, CD107a, GzmB, IFN-γ, T-bet, and GLUT-1. In addition, ADRB2 deficiency led to improved proliferation, increased CD8/CD4 T cell ratio, and decreased apoptosis in CAR-T cells. shβ2-CAR-T cells expressed more Bcl-2 and led to the generation of more significant proportions of T central memory cells. Finally, the ZAP-70/NF-κB signaling axis was shown to be responsible for the improved functions of novel CAR-T cells. In tumor-bearing mice, shβ2-CAR-T cells performed better than conventional CAR-T cells in eradicating prostate tumors. The study provides the basis for future clinical and translational CAR-T cell research to focus on adrenergic stress-mediated challenges in the tumor microenvironment of stressed tumors.","Aim: The present investigation aimed to develop niosomes containing gold nanoparticles (Nio-AuNPs) and to evaluate the combinational effect of Nio-AuNPs and x-ray radiation therapy (XRT) on growth inhibition potential and induction of apoptosis in the A549 cell line.Materials & methods: Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized, and niosomes were prepared using the thin-film hydration method. Various techniques were employed to determine their physiochemical characteristics. MTT assay, cell apoptosis analysis and combination index analysis were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic feasibility of Nio-AuNPs combined with XRT.Results: The combination of Nio-AuNPs and XRT resulted in greater cytotoxicity compared with XRT alone or with AuNPs.Conclusion: The AuNPs-loaded niosomal formulation enhances the efficacy of XRT on lung cancer cells in vitro, presenting a promising and effective therapeutic strategy.",1
"PurposeForkhead Box Protein 3 (FoxP3) is known as a key mediator in the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The aim of our study was to investigate whether FoxP3-positive Tregs have the potential to act as an independent predictor in progression as well as in regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, especially in patients with intermediate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II).MethodsNuclear FoxP3 expression was immunohistochemically analysed in 169 patient samples (CIN I, CIN II with regressive course, CIN II with progressive course, CIN III). The median numbers were calculated for each slide and correlated with the histological CIN grade. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 26 (Mann–Whitney U test, Spearman’s rank correlation).ResultsAn increased FoxP3 expression in CIN II with progression could be detected in comparison to CIN II with regression (p = 0.003). Total FoxP3 expression (epithelium and dysplasia-connected stroma) was higher in more advanced CIN grades (p < 0.001 for CIN I vs. CIN II; p = 0.227 for CIN II vs. CIN III). A positive correlation could be detected between FoxP3-positive cells in epithelium and total FoxP3 expression (Spearman’s Rho: 0,565; p < 0.01).ConclusionExpression of FoxP3 could be a helpful predictive factor to assess the risks of CIN II progression. As a prognosticator for regression and progression in cervical intraepithelial lesions it might thereby help in the decision process regarding surgical treatment vs. watchful waiting strategy to prevent conisation-associated risks for patients in child-bearing age. In addition, the findings support the potential of Tregs as a target for immune therapy in cervical cancer patients.","BackgroundTumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute the main infiltrating immune cells in the solid tumor microenvironment. Amounting studies have analyzed the antitumor effect on immune response induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), γ-interferon (γ-IFN), and palmitic Acid (PA). However, their combined treatment for gastric cancer (GC) has not been illuminated.MethodsWe investigated the relevance of macrophage polarization and the effect of PA and γ-IFN in GC in vitro and in vivo. M1 and M2 macrophage-associated markers were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometry, and the activation level of the TLR4 signaling pathways was evaluated by western blot analysis. The effect of PA and γ-IFN on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells (GCCs) was evaluated by Cell-Counting Kit-8, transwell assays, and wound-healing assays. In vivo animal models were used to verify the effect of PA and γ-IFN on tumor progression, and the M1 and M2 macrophage markers, CD8 + T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells (Treg) cells, and the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tumor tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical (IHC).ResultsThe results showed that this combination strategy enhanced M1-like macrophages and diminished M2-like macrophages through the TLR4 signaling pathway in vitro. In addition, the combination strategy impairs the proliferative and migratory activity of GCC in vitro and in vivo. While, the antitumor effect was abolished using the TAK-424 (a specific TLR-4 signaling pathway inhibitor) in vitro.ConclusionsThe combined treatment of PA and γ-IFN inhibited GC progression by modulating macrophages polarization via the TLR4 pathway.",0
"IntroductionhTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) is a catalytic subunit of the enzyme telomerase and has a role in cell proliferation, cellular senescence, and human aging.Materials and methodsThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression and significance of hTERT protein expression as a prognostic marker in different histological subtypes of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), including 46 embryonal carcinomas, 46 yolk sac tumors, 38 teratomas, 84 seminomas as well as two main subtypes of seminomas and non-seminomas using tissue microarray (TMA) technique.ResultsThe results showed that there is a statistically significance difference between the expression of hTERT and various histological subtypes of TGCTs (P < 0.001). In embryonal carcinoma, low level expression of hTERT protein was significantly associated with advanced pT stage (P = 0.023) as well as tunica vaginalis invasion (P = 0.043). Moreover, low level expression of hTERT protein was found to be a significant predictor of worse DSS (log rank: P = 0.011) and PFS (log rank: P = 0.011) in the univariate analysis. Additionally, significant differences were observed (P =0.021, P =0.018) with 5-year survival rates for DSS and PFS of 66% and 70% for moderate as compared to 97% and 97% for high hTERT protein expression, respectively.ConclusionWe showed that hTERT protein expression was associated with more aggressive tumor behavior in embryonal carcinoma patients. Also, hTERT may be a novel worse prognostic indicator of DSS or PFS, if the patients are followed up for more time periods.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03319-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Advancements in optoelectronic biointerfaces have revolutionized healthcare by enabling targeted stimulation and monitoring of cells, tissues, and organs. Photostimulation, a key application, offers precise control over biological processes, surpassing traditional modulation methods with increased spatial resolution and reduced invasiveness. This perspective highlights three approaches in non-genetic optoelectronic photostimulation: nanostructured phototransducers for cellular stimulation, micropatterned photoelectrode arrays for tissue stimulation, and thin-film flexible photoelectrodes for multiscale stimulation. Nanostructured phototransducers provide localized stimulation at the cellular or subcellular level, facilitating cellular therapy and regenerative medicine. Micropatterned photoelectrode arrays offer precise tissue stimulation, critical for targeted therapeutic interventions. Thin-film flexible photoelectrodes combine flexibility and biocompatibility for scalable medical applications. Beyond neuromodulation, optoelectronic biointerfaces hold promise in cardiology, oncology, wound healing, and endocrine and respiratory therapies. Future directions include integrating these devices with advanced imaging and feedback systems, developing wireless and biocompatible devices for long-term use, and creating multifunctional devices that combine photostimulation with other therapies. The integration of light and electronics through these biointerfaces paves the way for innovative, less invasive, and more accurate medical treatments, promising a transformative impact on patient care across various medical fields.",0
"BackgroundGallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare malignant tumour of the bile duct. Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations in the early stage, it is basically at an advanced stage when discovered. Radical resection remains the only curative therapy for patients with GBC. The resection rate is relatively low due to tumour invasion and metastasis, and the overall prognosis is poor. For most patients with unresectable lesions, chemotherapy has been the only recommended treatment for decades. Immunotherapy combined with TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) was proven to be effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Some physicians have attempted to apply immunotherapy and TKIs combined with traditional chemotherapy in patients with advanced GBC. However, the outcomes were not clear because limited cases were reported.Case presentationWe present a case series of four elderly patients with advanced GBC who received tislelizumab and lenvatinib combined with chemotherapy. All four patients responded to this treatment approach. Tumour responses were better in Patient 1 (TMB-H, MSS), Patient 2 (low TMB, MSS), and Patient 3 (low TMB, MSI-H) than in Patient 4 (low TMB, MSS), in whom metastasis occurred during the later stage of treatment.ConclusionThe combination of tislelizumab and lenvatinib may be a promising treatment for patients with advanced GBC. The efficacy and safety need further confirmation.","Background and aimsConversion therapy downstages tumors and renders patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) eligible for radical resection. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab plus lenvatinib and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4-HAIC) as a first-line conversion therapy.MethodsClinical data from HCC patients who were treated with the triple therapy between April 2021 and April 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), conversion resection rate (CRR), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs).ResultsA total of 18 patients completed conversion therapy assessment, which ended on March 27, 2023. The patients had a median age of 55.5 (37–72) years, and 94.4% were male. According to mRECIST, tumor shrinkage was observed in all patients, with an ORR of 94.4% (17/18), a DCR of 94.4% (17/18), and a median time to response of 1.4 (0.7–3.0) months. Successful conversion was observed in 61.1% (11/18) of patients (mRECIST). The CRR and pathological complete response were 38.9% (7/18) and 57.1% (4/7), respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 17.8 months, while median overall survival was not reached. The 6- and 9-month PFS rates were 83.3% and 66.7%, respectively. The most common TRAE (16/18 patients, 88.9%) was an increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels.ConclusionTislelizumab combined with lenvatinib and FOLFOX4-HAIC achieved a high conversion rate and acceptable toxicity in patients with unresectable HCC, suggesting that this combination may represent a new conversion strategy for this population.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDKidney cell carcinoma corresponds to the 14th cause of incidence in cancer in the world. Mortality is about 12.8 ASR in USA and 3.8 in Colombia. Metastatic disease corresponds to 14% of the patients, having worse prognosis compared to those patients with local or locally advanced disease. We want to share our experience of a patient with brain metastatic disease in clear cell carcinoma of the kidney, treated with TKI, IO and ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT) with outstanding results. Case summary: 65-year-old female, first diagnosed in 2011 with a clear cell carcinoma stage III, due to pT3aNxM0 at diagnosis, managed with radical nephrectomy. After this patient was 3 years free of disease, she developed in 2014 a meta-chronic papillary thyroid carcinoma stage III, due to T1N1M0, managed with total thyroidectomy plus nodal dissection, and adjuvant iodine therapy with 100 mci. In 2019 the patient presented a pulmonary new lesion, with confirmation of clear cell carcinoma, and was treated with pazopanib due to poor tolerance to sunitinib. In September 2022 the patient presented four lesions in both cerebral hemispheres, mainly involving the right frontal lobe as well as the mesial region of both temporal lobes. Neurosurgery performed a biopsy, confirming clear cell carcinoma. The patient received IMRT holoencephalic over 5 daily sessions. We started treatment with nivolumab in September 2022. After receiving 5 cycles of IO, the patient consulted due to new onset of convulsion, documenting edema of the main lesion, and neurologic worsening. After evaluating the case, we started anticonvulsive treatment and a short period of steroid, with recovery of her function. We used this treatment for around 10 days, and continued immunotherapy and anti-convulsant therapy. In January 2023, we started KMT, at a relation 3:1, measuring ketones and neurologic status constantly. After confirmation of ketones in urine or blood, we started adjustment of therapy to improve compliance. In July 2023, the patient didn’t require assistance to medical appointments, was capable of being free of anticonvulsive therapy, and her cognitive functions were all preserved. In January 2024, the patient remained with partial response, and dietary supplementation (ketovie) was stopped. CONCLUSIONThis case supports the use of KMT in clear cell renal carcinoma scenarios, in which it can be associated with a synergistic effect to ITK and/or immunotherapy, as well as radiotherapy modalities, improving progression-free survival and functional improvement without increasing toxicity.","BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"Objectives:To determine the clinical predictors of response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival to pembrolizumab in advanced or recurrent, mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) or Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) endometrial adenocarcinomas.Methods:A retrospective, single institution study was conducted among women with recurrent or advanced MMRd or MSI-H endometrial adenocarcinomas treated with single-agent pembrolizumab at our institution from 2017 to 2021. Logistic regression was used for univariable and multivariable analyses. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier and modeled via Cox proportional hazards regression. Log-rank test was used for intergroup comparisons based on body mass index (BMI). A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results:Among the 44 patients included in the analysis, the mean age was 64.1 years (range 41–87) and mean BMI was 32.9 (range 18.5–51.8). Mean cycles of pembrolizumab given was 12.8 (range 2–37). Median follow-up was 33 months (range 5–61) with a response rate of 63.6% and stable disease rate of 75%. When stratified by obesity status (BMI>30), disease control rate was 59.8% in patients with a BMI<30 and 85.2% in patients with a BMI≥30 patients (p=0.05). On multivariable analysis, obesity was associated with increased rate of disease control (OR 4.03, 95% CI 1.09, 28) while prior smoking was associated with decreased rate of disease control (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03, 0.85). PFS was significantly increased among patients with a BMI≥30 (p=0.03) but OS was similar (p=0.5)Conclusion:In this retrospective study, obesity is associated with increased rates of disease control and improved PFS in patients treated with single-agent pembrolizumab for recurrent or advanced MMRd or MSI-H endometrial adenocarcinomas.","The results of the IMbrave150 study have led to widespread use of the combination therapy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, immune checkpoint inhibitors show a spectrum of side effects ranging from mild side effects such as skin rash to potentially severe systemic effects such as myocarditis. We present a case of transverse myelitis diagnosed during the treatment of HCC with atezolizumab and bevacizumab combination therapy.",0
"Aptamers, synthetic single-strand oligonucleotides with a similar function to antibodies, are promising as therapeutics because of their minimal side effects. However, the stability and bioavailability of the aptamers pose a challenge. We developed aptamers converted from RNA aptamer to modified DNA aptamers targeting phospho-AXL with improved stability and bioavailability.Based on the comparative analysis of a library of 17 converted modified DNA aptamers, we selected aptamer candidates, GLB-G25 and GLB-A04 that exhibited highest bioavailability, stability and robust anti-tumor effect in vitro experiments.Backbone modifications such as thiophosphate or dithiophosphate and a covalent modification of the 5’-end of the aptamer with polyethylene glycol optimized the pharmacokinetic properties, improved the stability of the aptamers in vivo by reducing nuclease hydrolysis and renal clearance, and achieved high and sustained inhibition of AXL at a very low dose.Treatment with these modified aptamers in ovarian cancer orthotopic mouse models significantly reduced tumor growth and the number of metastases. This effective silencing of the phospho-AXL target thus demonstrated that aptamer specificity and bioavailability can be improved by chemical modification of existing aptamers for phospho-AXL. These results lay the foundation for translation of these aptamer candidates and companion biomarkers to the clinic.","Ovarian cancers are a complex and heterogenic group of malignancies that are difficult to detect, diagnose and treat. Fortunately, considerable knowledge of ovarian cancer specific biomarkers has been generated, that is pertinent to the development of novel theranostic platforms by combining therapies and diagnostics. Genomic and proteomic data has been invaluable in providing critical biomolecular targets for ovarian cancer theranostic approaches. Exploitation of the wealth of biomarker research that has been conducted offers viable targets as beacons for ovarian cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic targeting. These markers can be used in theranostics, a treatment strategy that combines therapy and diagnostics and is common in nuclear medicine, where radionuclides are used for both diagnosis and treatment. The development of theranostics has taken substantial focus in recent years in the battle against ovarian cancer. Yet to date only one theranostic technology has emerged in clinical practice. However, given the wealth of ovarian cancer biomarkers the field is poised to see the emergence of revolutionary disease treatment and monitoring outcomes through their incorporation into the development of theranostic strategies. The future of ovarian cancer treatment is set to enable precise diagnosis, targeted treatment, and vigilant monitoring. This review aims to assess the status of ovarian cancer diagnostic tools and biomarkers in practice, clinical development, or pre-clinical development, highlighting newly emerging theranostic applications.",1
"Background and aimsLiver fibrosis (LF) is the common pathological process of almost all liver diseases, but the pathogenesis is extremely complicated and has not been fully clarified. Therefore, we want to explore LF’s complex pathogenesis and identify key genetic markers that can predict LF prognosis.MethodsFrom Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,  we contained datasets GSE84044 and GSE130970. And involved GSE15654 whose survival data were for the validation of our model’s prognostic value. Then, Bulk RNA sequencing was used to establish a LF-related prognostic model and to determine key genes.The key genes were later analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and the role of macrophages in LF was investigated.ResultsWe established a comprehensive LF-related prognostic model (FMSig, that is, fibrosis macrophage-related prognostic signature) containing four genes (IER3, AKR1B10, ADCY1, and PGM1). FMSig can distinguish between survival outcomes in dataset GSE15654. IER3 showed a higher hazard ratio than the other three FMSig genes. Moreover, further scRNA-seq analysis showed that IER3 is highly expressed in myeloid cells while the other three genes were rarely expressed in six immune cell types and other cell clusters. After reclustering the myeloid cells into seven clusters, we found that IER3 was highly expressed in myeloid cell cluster 3, shown to be related to anti-inflammation and lipid metabolism functions. Based on pseudotime analysis, we suggest that myeloid cell type 3 is transformed from myeloid cell type 0 in the liver cirrhosis microenvironment. On immunohistochemical staining, LF showed significantly higher IER3 expression than healthy controls.ConclusionThis study established a predictive model, FMSig, to evaluate LF prognosis, and showed that IER3 and macrophages are related to LF.","PurposeThe immune microenvironment of sebaceous neoplasms (SNs) has been poorly explored, especially in benign lesions, and never correlated to the mismatch repair (MMR) status.MethodsWe conducted an immuno-histological study to analyze the immune microenvironment of SNs. A tissue microarray was constructed including sebaceous adenomas (SAs), sebaceomas (Ss) and sebaceous carcinomas (SCs) to performed immuno-histological analysis of T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and expression of Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1). An automatized count was performed using the QuPath® software. Composition of the cellular microenvironment was compared to the aggressiveness, the MMR status, and to Muir–Torre syndrome (MTS).ResultsWe included 123 SNs (43 SAs, 19 Ss and 61 SCs) for which 71.5% had a dMMR phenotype. A higher infiltration of macrophages (CD68 +) of M2 phenotype (CD163 +) and dendritic cells (CD11c +) was noticed in SCs compared to benign SNs (SAs and Ss). Programmed cell death ligand-1 but not PD-1 was expressed by more immune cells in SCs compared to benign SNs. No difference in the immune cell composition regarding the MMR status, or to MTS was observed.ConclusionIn SNs, M2 macrophages and dendritic cells infiltrates are associated with the progression and the malignant transformation of tumors. High PD-L1 expression in immune cells in SCs is an argument for the use of immunotherapy by anti-PD1 or PD-L1 in metastatic patients. The lack of correlation between the composition of immune cells in SNs and the MMR status emphasizes the singularity of SNs among MMR-associated malignancies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04629-x.",1
"ABSTRACTAsparagine synthetase (ASNS) catalyzes the biosynthesis of asparagine from aspartate and glutamine. Cells lacking ASNS, however, are auxotrophic for asparagine. Use of L-asparaginase to promote asparagine starvation in solid tumors with low ASNS levels, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is a rationale treatment strategy. However, tumor cell resistance to L-asparaginase has limited its clinical utility. Our preclinical studies show that RAS/MAPK signaling circumvents L-asparaginase-induced tumor killing, but L-asparaginase and MEK inhibition potentiated tumor killing; suggesting that this combination may provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients with PDAC. This Phase I trial (NCT05034627) will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib, in combination with pegylated L-asparaginase, L calaspargase pegol-mknl, in patients with locally-advanced or metastatic PDAC.","Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal and fast-growing cancers with a poor prognosis. Herein, we report the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a new prognostic biomarker in pancreatic cancer progression analysis at the clinical level. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 86 clinically proven cases of pancreatic cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) using anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Histoscore was done, and a variety of cutoffs were identified for analyses of the results. The chi-square test and Kaplan–Meier method were used to find the association between pancreatic cancer and various clinicopathological variables and the overall survival of the patients. PD-L1 expression was associated with histological grade and recurrence of the disease for epithelial and stromal staining at 10 histoscores. In addition, PD-L1 expression was strongly associated with lymph node involvement at the stromal 20 histoscore. The tumor stage of pancreatic cancer had an association with PD-L1 expression with epithelial and stromal 20 histoscores for all comparisons. At a stromal 20 histoscore, overall survival in high-low expression of PD-L1 was 7–19 months, and at a nuclear/cytoplasmic 10 histoscore, it was 9–28 months (p = 0.0001), respectively. Overall, PD-L1 overexpression in subcellular compartments was associated with disease aggression phenotypes and poor patient survival. Overexpression of PD-L1 was directly linked to pancreatic cancer progression and a poor survival rate. Therefore, PD-L1 may be used as a prognostic biomarker in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of pancreatic cancer patients.",1
"Circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary strategy in cancer immunotherapy, facilitating novel approaches to induce robust and durable immune responses. Unlike traditional linear messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development. This review delved into the fundamental principles underlying circRNA biology, highlighting their unique structural advantages and translational potential. We examined recent advancements in circRNA vaccine design, focusing on their application in oncology. As the circRNA-based cancer vaccine is a relatively novel technology, findings from all the major studies describing its efficacy were discussed. We further investigated their combination with other immunotherapeutic modalities, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies, that ensure the maximal anticancer effects of circRNA vaccines. Large-scale manufacturing, immunogenicity optimization, delivery systems, and other challenges and future directions in this field were also discussed. This study aims to thoroughly analyze the state-of-the-art and potential future applications of circRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy, highlighting them as exciting possibilities for next-generation cancer therapies.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia among the elderly, affects numerous individuals worldwide. Despite advances in understanding the molecular underpinnings of AD pathology, effective treatments to prevent or cure the disease remain elusive. AD is characterized not only by pathological hallmarks such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also by impairments in synaptic physiology, circuit activity and cognitive function. Synaptic homeostatic plasticity plays a vital role in maintaining the stability of synaptic and neural functions amid genetic and environmental disturbances. A key component of this regulation is presynaptic homeostatic potentiation, where increased presynaptic neurotransmitter release compensates for reduced postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, thereby stabilizing neuronal excitability. The role of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity in synapse stabilization in AD, however, remains unclear. Moreover, recent advances in transcriptomics have illuminated the complex roles of glial cells in regulating synaptic function in ageing brains and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the impact of AD-related abnormalities in glial signalling on synaptic homeostatic plasticity has not been fully delineated. This review discusses recent findings on how glial dysregulation in AD affects presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. There is increasing evidence that disrupted glial signalling, particularly through aberrant histone acetylation and transcriptomic changes in glia, compromises this plasticity in AD. Notably, the sphingosine signalling pathway has been identified as being protective in stabilizing synaptic physiology through epigenetic and homeostatic mechanisms, presenting potential therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",0
"AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.",SummaryThis article describes a case of a man in his early 40s who was diagnosed with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PPC). PPCs are rare and aggressive forms of lung cancer. Chemotherapy is of limited efficacy. We present a case that has seemingly recurred shortly after adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy following an R0 resection for localised disease. Biopsy however was negative for recurrence. PPCs may bear actionable mutations and tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used when appropriate. Immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy is emerging as the mainstay for metastatic disease despite a lack of evidence from randomised clinical trials.,1
"Aims: Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1 are crucial in cancer research for preventing cancer cells from evading the immune system.Materials & methods: This study developed a screening model combining ANN, molecular similarity, and GNINA 1.0 docking to target PD-L1. A database of 2044 substances was compiled from patents.Results: For molecular similarity, the AVALON emerged as the most effective fingerprint, demonstrating an AUC-ROC of 0.963. The ANN model outperformed the Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier in cross-validation and external validation, achieving an average precision of 0.851 and an F1 score of 0.790. GNINA 1.0 was validated through redocking and retrospective control, achieving an AUC of 0.975.Conclusions: From 15235 DrugBank compounds, 22 candidates were shortlisted. Among which (3S)-1-(4-acetylphenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid emerged as the most promising.","ABSTRACTProtein-protein interactions (PPIs) play pivotal roles in biological processes and are closely linked with human diseases. Research on small molecule inhibitors targeting PPIs provides valuable insights and guidance for novel drug development. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a crucial role in regulating human innate immunity and is implicated in various pathological conditions. Therefore, modulators of the cGAS-STING pathway have garnered extensive attention. Given that this pathway involves multiple PPIs, modulating PPIs associated with the cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as a promising strategy for modulating this pathway. In this review, we summarize an overview of recent advancements in medicinal chemistry insights into cGAS-STING PPI-based modulators and propose alternative strategies for further drug discovery based on the cGAS-STING pathway.",1
"PurposeBurkitt lymphoma (BL) is one of the most frequent subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children. Currently, short, intensive chemotherapy is used internationally and has greatly improved survival in children with BL. However, 5–10% of patients suffer recurrence after intensive chemotherapy, and the prognosis of these patients remains poor. The overall survival rate is only approximately 10%. Innovative therapies are needed to attain a higher rate of remission, such as immunotherapy for relapsed refractory (r/r) BL patients.MethodsAn 8-year-old boy with BL was studied. He suffered a relapse after treatment with standard chemotherapy. Then, we treated this patient using autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, sequentially targeting antigens CD19, CD22, and CD20. A review of the current literature on CAR-T treatment for lymphoma is presented.ResultsThe patient had no discernible response to anti-CD19 CAR-T treatment and exhibited progressive disease (PD). Following CD-22-directed CAR-T treatment, the patient underwent a partial remission (PR), but unfortunately a relapse rapidly occurred. Finally, after administering the anti-CD20 CAR-T cell therapy, the child went into complete remission (CR). The young boy has currently achieved 16-month event-free survival (EFS) so far. During administration of the CD19 and CD20 CAR-T cells, the patient appeared to experience mild (Grade I) cytokine release syndrome (CRS). However, during the CD22 CAR-T therapy, he appeared to experience grade III CRS.ConclusionAutologous anti-CD19, anti-CD22, and anti-CD20 CAR-T cell therapies targeting multiple tumor antigens could be an innovative and sound treatment for children with r/r BL, provided that they are closely monitored during treatment.","Blockade of the TGFβ signaling pathway has emerged from preclinical studies as a potential treatment to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and several other types of cancer. However, clinical translation of first-generation inhibitors has shown little success. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of HYL001, a potent inhibitor of TGFβ receptor 1 (ALK5), that is approximately 9 times more efficacious than the structurally related compound galunisertib, while maintaining a favorable safety profile. HYL001 in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1) eradicates liver metastases generated in mice by microsatellite stable, aggressive colorectal cancer tumors at doses where galunisertib is ineffective.",0
"With significant advancements of next generation sequencing technologies, large amounts of multi-omics data, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have been accumulated, offering an unprecedented opportunity to explore the heterogeneity and complexity of cancer across various molecular levels and scales. One of the promising aspects of multi-omics lies in its capacity to offer a holistic view of the biological networks and pathways underpinning cancer, facilitating a deeper understanding of its development, progression, and response to treatment. However, the exponential growth of data generated by multi-omics studies present significant analytical challenges. Processing, analyzing, integrating, and interpreting these multi-omics datasets to extract meaningful insights is an ambitious task that stands at the forefront of current cancer research. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful solution to these challenges, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in deciphering complex patterns and extracting valuable information from large-scale, intricate omics datasets. This review delves into the synergy of AI and multi-omics, highlighting its revolutionary impact on oncology. We dissect how this confluence is reshaping the landscape of cancer research and clinical practice, particularly in the realms of early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and pathology. Additionally, we elaborate the latest AI methods for multi-omics integration to provide a comprehensive insight of the complex biological mechanisms and inherent heterogeneity of cancer. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of data harmonization, algorithm interpretability, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges necessitates a multidisciplinary collaboration, paving the promising way for more precise, personalized, and effective treatments for cancer patients.","ABSTRACTAimsTo study programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.MethodsThe study included samples from 50 early-stage NSCLCs. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides (clone SP263) were scored manually and with two different AI tools (PathAI and Navify Digital Pathology) by three pathologists. TILs were digitally assessed on H&E and CD8 IHC stained sections with two different algorithms (PathAI and Navify Digital Pathology, respectively). The agreement between observers and methods for each biomarker was analysed. For PD-L1, the turn-around time (TAT) for manual versus AI-assisted scoring was recorded.ResultsAgreement was higher in tumours with low PD-L1 expression regardless of the approach. Both AI-powered tools identified a significantly higher number of cases equal or above 1% PD-L1 tumour proportion score as compared with manual scoring (p=0.00015), a finding with potential therapeutic implications. Regarding TAT, there were significant differences between manual scoring and AI use (p value <0.0001 for all comparisons). The total TILs density with the PathAI algorithm and the total density of CD8+ cells with the Navify Digital Pathology software were significantly correlated (τ=0.49 (95% CI 0.37, 0.61), p value<0.0001).ConclusionsThis preliminary study supports the use of AI algorithms for the scoring of PD-L1 and TILs in patients with NSCLC.",1
"Head and neck cancers (HNC) are aggressive, difficult-to-treat tumors that can be caused by genetic factors but mainly by lifestyle or infection caused by the human papillomavirus. As the sixth most common malignancy, it presents a formidable therapeutic challenge with limited therapeutic modalities. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is appearing as a promising multitarget anticancer and antimetastatic agent. Numerous studies have shown that curcumin and its derivatives have the potential to affect signaling pathways (NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and EGFR) and molecular mechanisms that are crucial for the growth and migration of head and neck tumors. Furthermore, its ability to interact with the tumor microenvironment and trigger the immune system may significantly influence the organism’s immune response to the tumor. Combining curcumin with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy may improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the side effects of treatment, thereby increasing its therapeutic potential. This review is a comprehensive overview that discusses both the benefits and limitations of curcumin and its therapeutic effects in the context of tumor biology, with an emphasis on molecular mechanisms in the context of HNC. This review also includes possibilities to improve the limiting properties of curcumin both in terms of the development of new derivatives, formulations, or combinations with conventional therapies that have potential as a new type of therapy for the treatment of HNC and subsequent use in clinical practice.","BackgroundLow-grade glioma (LGG) is a crucial pathological type of glioma. The present study aimed to explore multiple RNA methylation regulator-related AS events and investigate their prognostic values in LGG.MethodsThe prognostic model for low-grade glioma was established using the LASSO regression analysis. To validate prognostic value, we performed Kaplan–Maier survival analysis, ROC curves and nomograms. The ESTIMATE algorithm, the CIBERSORT algorithm and the ssGSEA algorithm were utilized to explore the role of the immune microenvironment in LGG. Subsequently, we then used GO, KEGG and GSEA enrichment analysis to explore the functional roles of these genes. In addition, we employed the GDSC database to screen potential chemotherapeutic agents.ResultsEight RNA methylation related AS events were involved in construct a survival and prognosis model, which had good ability of independent prediction for patients with LGG. Patients in the high-risk group had shorter life expectancy and higher mortality, while patients in the low-risk group had a better prognosis. We constructed a nomogram which showed an excellent predictive performance for individual OS. The risk score exhibited a close correlation with some immune cells and expression of immune checkpoints. Patients in high-risk group were characterized by immunosuppressive microenvironment and poor response to immunotherapy, and were sensitive to more chemotherapeutic drugs. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses further confirmed that significant differences existed in immune landscape between the two subgroups.ConclusionThe prognostic RNA methylation-related alternative splicing signature constructed could constitute a promising prognostic biomarker, which could serve to optimize treatment regimens.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04431-1.",0
"AbstractBackgroundRacial and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in gynecologic cancer clinical trials despite disproportionately worse oncologic outcomes. Research shows differential racial enrollment patterns because of comorbidity-based exclusion criteria. Our objective was to evaluate contemporary trends in comorbidity-based exclusion criteria among National Cancer Institute–sponsored gynecologic cancer clinical trials and protocol adherence to broadened eligibility criteria guidelines as an assessment of equitable enrollment access.MethodsThe ClinicalTrials.gov registry was queried for National Cancer Institute–sponsored gynecologic cancer clinical trials (1994-2021). Study characteristics and comorbidity-based exclusion criteria were abstracted from protocols. Descriptive statistics and temporal trends were calculated using χ2 testing with STATA v17 software.ResultsAmong 279 clinical trials identified, 65% completed enrollment, 53% were phase II, and 48% focused on ovarian cancer. Pharmaceutical agents (85%) were the primary therapeutic interventions. Several inequitably restrictive exclusion criteria increased over time such as hepatitis infection (17% in 1994-2000 vs 49% in 2015-2021, P < .001) and cardiovascular disease (47% in 1994-2000 vs 66% in 2015-2021, P = .002). A previously rare exclusion, “mental illness and/or social situations,” dramatically increased from 5% to 51% (P < .001) over 3 decades. Adherence to broadened eligibility criteria recommendations was mixed. Renal function, cardiovascular disease, and performance status criteria were not broadened, but HIV, prior or concurrent malignancies, and brain metastasis criteria were.ConclusionsSome, but not all, of the known restrictive comorbidity-based exclusion criteria have increased in gynecologic cancer clinical trial design, despite calls for improving racial and ethnic minority representation. Exclusion criteria are critical for trial safety, however, they must be carefully considered given the differential racial impact on eligibility.","AimTo describe a 10-year follow-up of children (<16y) with acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) from a UK-wide prospective surveillance study.MethodDiagnoses were retrieved from the patients’ records via the patients’ paediatric or adult neurologist using a questionnaire. Demyelinating phenotypes at follow-up were classified by an expert review panel.ResultsTwenty-four out of 125 (19.2%) children (64 males, 61 females; median age 10y, range 1y 4mo–15y 11mo), identified in the original study, were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (incidence of 2.04/million children/year); 23 of 24 fulfilled 2017 McDonald criteria at onset. Aquaporin-4-antibody neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders were diagnosed in three (2.4%, 0.26/million children/year), and relapsing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease in five (4%, 0.43/million children/year). Three out of 125 seronegative patients relapsed and 85 of 125 (68%) remained monophasic over 10 years. Five of 125 patients (4%) originally diagnosed with ADS were reclassified during follow-up: three children diagnosed initially with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were subsequently diagnosed with acute necrotising encephalopathy (RAN-binding protein 2 mutation), primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (Munc 13-4 gene inversion), and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. One child initially diagnosed with optic neuritis was later diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency, and one presenting with transverse myelitis was subsequently diagnosed with Sjögren syndrome.InterpretationThe majority of ADS presentations in children are monophasic, even at 10-year follow-up. Given the implications for treatment strategies, multiple sclerosis and central nervous system autoantibody mimics warrant extensive investigation.",0
"IntroductionWhile some clinical studies have shown that PD-1 and PD-L1 can also be an effective neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), no evidence has been available for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor sintilimab combined with chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment for potentially resectable NSCLC in the Chinese population.MethodsThis prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial (registration number: NCT04326153) included treatment-naive patients with potentially resectable NSCLC (stage IIIA/IIIB) who received sintilimab plus nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin for two to three cycles before systematic nodal dissection 30 to 45 days after neoadjuvant treatment. After surgery, patients needed to complete two cycles of adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (sintilimab + nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival rate at 24 months, whereas secondary endpoints included major pathological response (MPR) and pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, the proportion of patients who achieved tumor downstaging, overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), and adverse effects. PD-L1 status before and after treatment was also determined.ResultsAmong the 20 patients who received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, 16 underwent radical resection. The disease control rate and ORR were 90% and 70%, respectively. Among the 16 patients who underwent surgery, 10 (62.5%) and 5 (31.25%) achieved MPR and pCR, respectively. Squamous cell NSCLC exhibited superior response rates compared to adenocarcinoma (pCR 35.7% vs. 0%). Moreover, 14 patients (70%) experienced grade 1 or 2 neoadjuvant treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), whereas 6 (30%) experienced grade 3 TRAEs. Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) was found in the current study as an adverse reaction of concern. The rate of BPF was 20% (4/20), of which three patients were in grade 1–2, and one patient died. The occurrence of BPF had no significant correlation with basic disease history, nutritional status, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, surgical procedure, pathological remission, and PD-L1 expression. However, during neoadjuvant treatment, no adverse events prompted dose reduction, treatment discontinuation, surgery delay, or death. Although PD-L1 expression may change after chemoimmunotherapy, no regular pattern was noted. PD-L1 expression, neither at baseline nor after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, was associated with pathological remission.ConclusionsThe current study found similar ORR, slightly lower MPR and pCR rates, and lower grade 3 TRAEs among patients with potentially resectable stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC compared to the NADIM trial, as well as a greater ORR, MPR rate, pCR rate, and grade 3 TRAEs compared to Gao’s study involving sintilimab for Chinese patients with resectable stage IA–IIIB NSCLC. Though neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy had been found to promote a high risk of BPF for patients with stage IIIA/IIIB disease, it offered greater potential for radical cure. Therefore, the current study suggests that neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy can be a safe approach in increasing the efficiency of treatment and hopefully improving the prognosis of patients with potentially resectable locally advanced NSCLC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03896-w.","AbstractTheranostics is a new treatment modality integrating molecular imaging with targeted radionuclide therapy. Theranostic agents have received regulatory approval for some systemic cancers and have therapeutic potential in neuro-oncology. As clinical trials are developed to evaluate the efficacy of theranostic agents in brain tumors, specific considerations will have to be considered, taking into account lessons learned from previous studies examining other treatment modalities in neuro-oncology. These include the need for molecular imaging or surgical window-of-opportunity studies to confirm adequate passage across the blood-brain barrier, optimize eligibility criteria, and selection of the most appropriate response criteria and endpoints to address issues such as pseudoprogression. This review will discuss some of the issues that should be considered when designing clinical trials for theranostic agents.",0
"PurposeTo investigate the relationship between the microlymphangiogenesis, microangiogenesis, and combined detection of the programmed cell death-1 protein (PD-1)/ki67 in patients with gastric cancer as well as the disease prognosis.MethodsImmunohistochemistry was used to detect the microlymphatic density (MLD) and microvessel density (MVD) in the central and peripheral zones in 92 cases of gastric cancer, along with the number of PD-1- and ki67-positive tumor cells.ResultsThe central zone of the gastric cancer tissue contained fewer atretic cord-like lymphatic vessels than the peripheral zone, while the peripheral zone contained an increased number of lymphatic vessels compared with the central zone. In most cases, the lumen was also dilated. Compared with the MLD in the peripheral zone, the MLD in central zone was significantly decreased. Compared with the number of PD-1-positive cells in the peripheral zone, the number of PD-1-positive cells in the central zone was significantly decreased, and compared with the number of ki67-positive cells in the peripheral zone. The differences in the microlymphangiogenesis, microangiogenesis, and the number of PD-1- and ki67-positive cells among the different histological types were not statistically significant. The microlymphangiogenesis, microangiogenesis, and PD-1- and ki67-positive cells were significantly decreased in the gastric cancer tissues from the patients in stages T1 and T2 compared with the gastric cancer tissues from the patients in stages T3 and T4.ConclusionsThe detection of the MLD and MVD as well as the positive expression of PD-1 and ki67 in gastric cancer tissue are important reference indicators for judging the prognosis of gastric cancer.","PurposeTo explore the feasibility and performance of machine learning-based radiomics models in predicting thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsA total of 227 NSCLC patients were included in this retrospective study and divided into the training set and test set with a ratio of 8:2 randomly. Lung tumors on CT images were semi-automatic segmented utilizing 3D Slicer. Radiomic features quantifying tumor intensity, shape, texture, and transformed wavelet were extracted using a Python toolkit. Variance threshold (VT), principal component analysis (PCA), and least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) were used to reduce features; logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to develop classifier, respectively. The performance of the models was evaluated by areas under the curves (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Different models were compared by the Delong test to determine the optimal algorithms.ResultsTotal 1968 radiomic features were extracted from the lung tumors images, and then 13, 15, and 13 stable features were selected by VT, PCA, and LASSO, respectively. Each classifier could discriminate against the TTF-1-positive groups with average AUC ranging from 0.601 to 0.784 in the training set. Among the models, three models constructed by the LASSO method showed satisfactory performance in the test set with AUC ranging from 0.715 to 0.787. The Delong test showed no significant difference between the LASSO models (P > 0.05).ConclusionMachine learning-based radiomics model could predict the expression of TTF-1 in NSCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04357-8.",1
"Oesophageal cancer (EC), ranking 11th in incidence and 7th in mortality globally, presents a significant health challenge, with a notable prevalence in India, especially in the northeastern region. This article examines the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in treating locally advanced EC, analyzing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between 2000 and 2024. NACRT, involving preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, has shown improved survival rates, notably in the CROSS trial, which reported a 10-year overall survival benefit of 13%. Conversely, NACT is supported by key trials like the OE02 and MAGIC trials, demonstrating comparable survival outcomes. Key points of debate include compliance, complications, response and resection status, survival rates, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Compliance rates are similar for both modalities, though disease progression is more common after NACT. Postoperative complications and mortality rates are comparable, with NACTRT showing higher pathologic complete response (pCR) and R0 resection rates, potentially avoiding additional adjuvant radiation. While NACRT shows marginally better 3-year survival rates, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma, 5-year survival rates and HRQOL outcomes are similar for both treatments. NACTRT is associated with more respiratory symptoms, whereas NACT patients experience more gastrointestinal issues. Both NACT and NACTRT are viable options, with the choice depending on patient-specific factors and a thorough assessment of potential benefits and risks. Further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols for EC.","PurposeThe optimal mode of neoadjuvant treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been well characterized. Our study compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) for patients with ESCC.MethodsData from ESCC patients receiving NCRT or NCT combined with esophagectomy between 2010 and 2018 from the National Cancer Center in China were retrospectively collected. Long-term survival, pathological response, and perioperative mortality and morbidity were compared between the NCRT and NCT groups. A Cox proportional hazards model and propensity score matching (PSM) were used to minimize bias due to potential confounding.ResultsOut of 327 eligible patients with ESCC in our study, 90 patients were identified in each group by PSM. The complete pathologic response (pCR) rate in the NCRT group was markedly higher than that in the NCT group (before PSM: 35.1% vs. 6.0%; after PSM: 38.9% vs. 5.6%; both P < 0.001). The rates of 30-day or 90-day mortality were comparable between the two groups, but the NCRT group had a longer postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.001 before PSM and P = 0.012 after PSM) and more postoperative complications (P < 0.001 before PSM and P = 0.014 after PSM), especially, anastomotic leaks (P = 0.001 before PSM and P = 0.013 after PSM). No significant differences in 5-year overall survival (OS) (P = 0.439) or 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.611) were noted between unmatched groups, but the trend favored NCRT in the propensity score-matched group (77.3% vs. 61.3%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–2.87; P = 0.141 for OS, and 77.8% vs. 60.5%; HR 1.72; 95% CI 0.95–3.11; P = 0.073 for RFS). Multivariate analysis showed that only ypT and ypN stages were independent predictors of OS before and after PSM (both P < 0.05).ConclusionThere was no difference in survival between the NCT and NCRT groups, although a trend favored NCRT related to the significantly higher pCR rates. Prospective head-to-head clinical trials to compare these two types of neoadjuvant therapies in ESCC are warranted.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03659-7.",1
"BackgroundThe use of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with other anti-cancer agents was a priority for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with considerable PD-L1 expression. However, studies seldom show the progression of liver metastases after using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).MethodsData were obtained from the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care of Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Military Medical University. In the present study, we analyzed five non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had liver metastases after they were treated with pembrolizumab between 2019 and 2021. All of them had both stable primary lesions and liver progression with pembrolizumab intervention. Blood laboratory tests and imaging examinations were performed regularly during the treatment to assess the tumor responses of patients.ResultsAll patients displayed reduction or stability in the initial lesions as a result, but they also experienced the emergence of metastatic liver locations, which were regularly detected throughout immunotherapy. Additionally, the appearance of liver metastasis weakened their liver function gradually with the escalation of carcinoembryonic antigen, regarded as a predictor for evaluating the progression of tumors. These individuals were highly distinctive with hyper-progressive diseases associated with immunotherapy. We drew individualized intervention schemes for metastatic lesions in each patient and found that their life expectancy shared no significance given the restricting subjected population.ConclusionsOur study indicated a clinical phenomenon after using immune checkpoint inhibitors and presented a necessity for implementing large scales clinical studies to manage NSCLC-oriented liver metastasis.","Background and aimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and deadly disease with limited treatment options. Regorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promise in HCC treatment but faces limitations as a monotherapy. Combining regorafenib with PD-1 inhibitor may improve efficacy and survival outcomes for patients. This retrospective analysis was conducted to explore its efficacy and safety, providing reference experience for better application of this combination therapy.MethodsThis retrospective single-center study evaluated the efficacy and safety of combining regorafenib with PD-1 blockade for patients with HCC. Efficacy was evaluated according to the RECIST 1.1 evaluation criteria. Safety was assessed using CTCAE 4.0. Data was analyzed to compare survival status in different subgroups.ResultsGenerally, there were 76 patients with HCC elected to receive the regorafenib plus PD-1 blockade treatment during the study period. The objective response rate was 21.1% (n = 16), and the disease control rate was 56.6% (n = 43). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.8 months, and median overall survival had not yet been reached. All patients suffered of at least 1 adverse event. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 31.6% of patients (n = 24), with the most common being hand-foot syndrome, decreased appetite, and abdominal distension. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in PFS based on cirrhosis status or previous treatment lines.ConclusionWith manageable safety, regorafenib combined PD-1 inhibitor could bring survival benefits for advanced HCC who have received systemic treatment. Further, the Cox analysis showed that HBV infection, metastasis, etc. did not have significant effects on the survival benefits.",1
"BACKGROUND:Endemic and pandemic infectious diseases take a substantial toll on human health. Advancing understanding about the determinants of protective immunity could provide avenues toward improved treatments for infections. In 1983, a small protein and presumptive antiviral “interferon,” IFN-γ, was characterized as a factor released by antigen-stimulated lymphocytes that equips macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Shortly thereafter, IFN-γ became the first cytokine used for host-directed therapy of a nonviral infectious disease in humans. The ensuing decades of research developed knowledge about the induction of IFN-γ and its downstream target genes; provided an understanding about individuals with IFN-γ–related genetic defects that render them susceptible to infections; and documented the therapeutic impact of endogenously produced and exogenously administered IFN-γ on infectious disease.ADVANCES:It is now known that IFN-γ is produced by various lymphocytes. IFN-γ released by these lymphoid populations can act on cells expressing IFN-γ receptor plus the kinases (Janus kinases 1 and 2) and transcription factor (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) needed for signaling in response to IFN-γ. Although IFN-γ was initially considered to regulate macrophages, hundreds of human cell types express the signaling machinery and may have the ability to respond to IFN-γ.The hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) elicited by IFN-γ encode a variety of proteins, including enzymes, ion channels, and pumps. These molecules promote oxidation, nitrosylation, and acidification of intracellular microbes residing in vacuoles; restrict the availability of host metabolites and metals on which pathogens depend; disrupt microbial membranes; impair microbial uptake into or exit from host cells; or promote eviction of microbial pathogens. Given the cytotoxic effects of some ISGs, numerous suppressors and antagonists regulate the action of IFN-γ. These include type I IFNs, which can reduce production of IFN-γ; transforming growth factor–β and interleukin-10, which block IFN-γ’s ability to activate macrophages; and regulatory T cells induced in part by IFN-γ itself.Although both knockout mice and people with inborn errors of IFN-γ immunity are susceptible to diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections, the nonredundant role of IFN-γ in human host defense is narrower than in artificially infected mice. Growing knowledge of “Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease” (MSMD) reveals it to be neither strictly Mendelian nor restricted to mycobacterial disease, to arise from genotypes in at least 21 loci that impair production of and/or responses to IFN-γ, and to be phenocopied by auto-antibodies that neutralize IFN-γ. Besides reinforcing the importance of IFN-γ for macrophage antimicrobial defense, MSMD studies have uncovered multiple new facets of human immunobiology, for example, that interferon-stimulated gene 15 secreted by granulocytes promotes IFN-γ secretion by natural killer cells, giving the host a way to activate macrophages without recourse to adaptive immunity. Lastly, beneficial clinical experience with administration of recombinant IFN-γ has been reported in >1100 patients for prophylaxis or treatment of diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections.OUTLOOK:We now have a wider view of what it means to be an “interferon,” the cells beyond macrophages that IFN-γ equips, and the opportunities to prevent or treat infections that IFN-γ offers. Patients deficient for IFN-γ production but who can respond to it are candidates for adjunctive IFN-γ treatment or prophylaxis. Such individuals include those with MSMD as well as those with other immunodeficiencies, for example, people with HIV/AIDS, certain cancers, advanced age, or a disease-selective defect in producing IFN-γ during infection.Clinical use of IFN-γ will benefit from a deeper knowledge of IFN-γ biology. For example, future work could help answer the following questions: How are new IFN-γ–dependent genes born and regulated? How widely do transposable elements and endogenous retroviruses serve as functional components in the promoters of IFN-γ–dependent ISGs? What are the roles and structures of many IFN-γ–induced ISGs whose biology remains mysterious? What are the contributions of ISGs that are negatively affected by IFN-γ? How do regulatory loops among different IFN responses affect the course of infections? Hopefully, we can use the answers to such questions to design novel approaches to kill or restrict microbes that cause serious disease or death in the human population. We may also help treat some infectious diseases with an exogenous source of antimicrobial molecules whose production IFN-γ normally induces in the host.","BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. The progression of numerous malignancies has been linked to abnormal vesicle-mediated transport-related gene (VMTRG) expression. The prognostic importance of VMTRGs in HCC is uncertain nonetheless.MethodsUtilizing HCC data from TCGA and ICGC, we employed univariate cox analysis, unsupervised clustering, and lasso analysis to construct molecular subtypes and prognostic signature of HCC based on the prognostic-associated VMTRGs expression levels. Subsequently, we validated the expression levels of the signature genes. We investigated the probable pathways using gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Six methods were utilized to compare immune cell infiltration between two risk groups. Moreover, the “pRRophetic” algorithm was utilized to test the drug sensitivity of both groups.ResultsWe identified two distinct subtypes with divergent biological behaviors and immune functionality through unsupervised clustering. Subtype C1 demonstrated a poorer prognosis. A prognostic signature incorporating two VMTRGs (KIF2C and RAC1) was formulated. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analyses unveiled a significant upregulation of these pivotal genes within HCC tissues. The prognosis was worse for the high-risk group, which also had a higher clinicopathological grade, higher levels of tumor mutation burden (TMB), a higher immunological infiltration of CD8 + T cells, a higher expression of immune checkpoints, and enhanced immunotherapy efficacy. These two risk groups also have varied chemotherapy drug sensitivities.ConclusionsBased on VMTRGs, we have developed a signature that assists in accurate prognosis prediction and formulating personalized treatment strategies for HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05079-1.",0
"Background: The ever-increasing complexity and demand for antineoplastic therapy necessitates innovative solutions to improve the accuracy and safety of drug preparation. Objective: To evaluate the utilization of an advanced robotic chemotherapy drug compounding system (APOTECAchemo) at a Community Cancer Center (CCC), examining accuracy, efficiency, and staff perceptions. Methods: This single-center, retrospective study evaluated the preparation of 7 intravenous (IV) antineoplastics at a CCC over a 1-year period. We compared manual methods with the APOTECAchemo system. The primary measure of accuracy was the absolute drug error percentage, with a comparison of pass and fail rates. Secondary endpoints included the overall use of APOTECAchemo for all IV antineoplastic preparations and average preparation times. An end-user satisfaction survey gathered feedback from pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Results: A total of 8210 doses were prepared at the CCC, with 52.1% compounded by APOTECAchemo and 47.9% manually. Of these, the CCC prepared 5526 doses of the 7 routinely compounded antineoplastics. APOTECAchemo prepared 3851 (69.7%) doses, while manual compounding accounted for 1675 (30.3%) doses. The average absolute drug error was 1.44% (95% CI, 1.35-1.53) with robot compounding versus 1.17% (95% CI, 1.03-1.32) with manual (P < 0.001). The overall failure rate was 0.72%. There were 25 failed doses (0.45%), with 8 (0.2%) failures attributed to APOTECAchemo and 17 (1%) to manual compounding (P < 0.001). The average dose preparation time was longer with APOTECAchemo compared with manual methods. The end-user satisfaction survey indicated a positive reception toward APOTECAchemo. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the successful implementation, extensive utilization, and high accuracy of both APOTECAchemo and manual compounding methods in the preparation of routinely administered antineoplastics at a CCC.","PurposeThis study aimed to construct and validate a nomogram that incorporated clinical data and preoperative blood markers to differentiate BPGTs from MPGTs more efficiently and at low cost.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent parotidectomy and histopathological diagnosis at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from January 2013 to June 2022. Subjects were randomly divided into training and validation sets with a 7:3 ratio. In the training set, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was performed to select the most relevant features from 19 variables and built a nomogram using logistic regression. We evaluated the model’s performance using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, clinical decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA).ResultsThe final sample consisted of 644 patients, of whom 108 (16.77%) had MPGTs. The nomogram included four features: current smoking status, pain/tenderness, peripheral facial paralysis, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). The optimal cut-off value for the nomogram was 0.17. The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) of the nomogram were 0.748 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.689–0.807) and 0.754 (95% CI = 0.636–0.872) in the training and validation sets, respectively. The nomogram also showed good calibration, high accuracy, moderate sensitivity, and acceptable specificity in both sets. The DCA and CICA demonstrated that the nomogram had significant net benefits for a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.06–0.88 for the training set; 0.06–0.57 and 0.73–0.95 for the validation set).ConclusionThe nomogram based on clinical characteristics and preoperative blood markers was a reliable tool for discriminating BPGTs from MPGTs preoperatively.",0
"PurposeWe report preliminary dosimetric data concerning the use of 1.5-T MR-guided daily-adaptive radiotherapy for abdomino-pelvic lymph-nodal oligometastases. We aimed to assess the impact of this technology on mitigating daily variations for both target coverage and organs-at-risk (OARs) sparing.MethodsA total of 150 sessions for 30 oligometastases in 23 patients were analyzed. All patients were treated with MR-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for a total dose of 35 Gy in five fractions. For each fraction, a quantitative analysis was performed for PTV volume, V35Gy and Dmean. Similarly, for OARs, we assessed daily variations of volume, Dmean, Dmax. Any potential statistically significant change between baseline planning and daily-adaptive sessions was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, assuming a p value < 0.05 as significant.ResultsAverage baseline PTV, bowel, bladder, and single intestinal loop volumes were respectively 8.9 cc (range 0.7–41.2 cc), 1176 cc (119–3654 cc), 95 cc (39.7–202.9 cc), 18.3 cc (9.1–37.7 cc). No significant volume variations were detected for PTV (p = 0.21) bowel (p = 0.36), bladder (p = 0.47), except for single intestinal loops, which resulted smaller (p = 0.026). Average baseline V35Gy and Dmean for PTV were respectively 85.6% (72–98.8%) and 35.6 Gy (34.6–36.1 Gy). We recorded a slightly positive trend in favor of daily-adaptive strategy vs baseline planning for improved target coverage, although not reaching statistical significance (p = 0.11 and p = 0.18 for PTV-V35Gy and PTV-Dmean). Concerning OARs, a significant difference was observed in favor of daily-adapted treatments in terms of single intestinal loop Dmax [23.05 Gy (13.2–26.9 Gy) at baseline vs 20.5 Gy (12.1–24 Gy); p value = 0.0377] and Dmean [14.4 Gy (6.5–18 Gy) at baseline vs 13.0 Gy (6.7–17.6 Gy); p value = 0.0003]. Specifically for bladder, the average Dmax was 18.6 Gy (0.4–34.3 Gy) at baseline vs 18.3 Gy (0.7–34.3 Gy) for a p value = 0.28; the average Dmean was 7.0 Gy (0.2–16.6 Gy) at baseline vs 6.98 Gy (0.2–16.4 Gy) for a p value = 0.66. Concerning the bowel, no differences in terms of Dmean [4.78 Gy (1.3–10.9 Gy) vs 5.6 Gy (1.4–10.5 Gy); p value = 0.23] were observed between after daily-adapted sessions. A statistically significant difference was observed for bowel Dmax [26.4 Gy (7.7–34 Gy) vs 25.8 Gy (7.8–33.1 Gy); p value = 0.0086].ConclusionsDaily-adaptive MR-guided SBRT reported a significantly improved single intestinal loop sparing for lymph-nodal oligometastases. Also, bowel Dmax was significantly reduced with daily-adaptive strategy. A minor advantage was also reported in terms of PTV coverage, although not statistically significant.","BackgroundDelivering stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with multiple oligometastases represents a challenge for clinical and technical reasons. We aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with SABR and the impact of tumor volume on survival.Materials and methodsWe included all the patients treated with single course SABR for 3 to 5 extracranial oligometastases. All patients were treated with the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique with ablative intent. End-points of the analysis were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), local control (LC) and toxicity.Results136 patients were treated from 2012 to 2020 on 451 oligometastases. Most common primary tumor was colorectal cancer (44.1%) followed by lung cancer (11.8%). A total of 3, 4 and 5 lesions were simultaneously treated in 102 (75.0%), 26 (19.1%), and 8 (5.9%) patients, respectively. Median total tumor volume (TTV) was 19.1 cc (range 0.6–245.1). With a median follow-up of 25.0 months, OS at 1 and 3 years was 88.4% and 50.2%, respectively. Increasing TTV was independent predictive factor of worse OS (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.18–4.78, p = 0.014) and PFS (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.05–2.54; p = 0.028). Median OS was 80.6 months if tumor volume was ≤ 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 93.6% and 77.5%, respectively), and 31.1 months if TTV was higher than 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 86.7% and 42.3%, respectively). Rates of LC at 1 and 3 years were 89.3% and 76.5%. In terms of toxicity, no grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported both in the acute and late settings.ConclusionWe demonstrated the impact of tumor volume on survival and disease control of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with single course SABR.",1
"Aim: The current work is an extension to our previous work for the development of new thalidomide analogs.Materials & methods: Quinazolinone-based molecules carrying a glutarimide moiety have been designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated for immunomodulatory and anticancer activity.Results: Compounds 7d and 12 showed considerable immunomodulatory properties in comparison to thalidomide. 7d and 12 significantly reduced TNF-α levels in HepG-2 cells from 162.5 to 57.4 pg/ml and 49.2 pg/ml, respectively, compared with 53.1 pg/ml reported for thalidomide. Moreover, they caused 69.33 and 77.74% reduction in NF-κB P65, respectively, compared with 60.26% reduction for thalidomide. Similarly, they reduced VEGF from 432.5 to 161.3 pg/ml and 132.8 pg/ml, respectively, in comparison to 153.2 pg/ml reported for thalidomide. The two new derivatives, 7d and 12 also showed about eightfold increases in caspase-8 levels in cells treated with them. These results were slightly better than those of thalidomide. The obtained results revealed that Compound 12 had better immunomodulatory properties than thalidomide, with stronger effects on TNF-α, NF-κB P65, VEGF and caspase-8.Conclusion: This work indicates that compounds 7d and 12 have interesting biological properties that should be further evaluated and modified in order to develop clinically useful thalidomide analogs.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disorder in which the insulin-producing β-cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas are destroyed, afflicts over 1.6 million Americans. Although pancreatic islet transplantation has shown promise in treating T1D, continuous use of required immunosuppression regimens limits clinical islet transplantation as it poses significant adverse effects on graft recipients and does not achieve consistent long-term graft survival with 50–70% of recipients maintaining insulin independence at 5 years. T cells play a key role in graft rejection, and rebalancing pathogenic T effector and protective T regulatory cells can regulate autoimmune disorders and transplant rejection. The synergy of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Fas immunomodulatory pathways presents an avenue for eliminating the need for systemic immune suppression by exploiting IL-2’s role in expanding regulatory T cells and leveraging Fas ligand (FasL) activity on antigen-induced cell death of effector T cells. Herein, we developed a hydrogel platform for co-delivering an analog of IL-2, IL-2D, and FasL-presenting microgels to achieve localized immunotolerance to pancreatic islets by targeting the upregulation of regulatory T cells and effector T cells simultaneously. Although this hydrogel provided for sustained, local delivery of active immunomodulatory proteins, indefinite allograft survival was not achieved. Immune profiling analysis revealed upregulation of target regulatory T cells but also increases in Granzyme B-expressing CD8+ T cells at the graft site. We attribute the failed establishment of allograft survival to these Granzyme B-expressing T cells. This study underscores the delicate balance of immunomodulatory components important for allograft survival – whose outcome can be dependent on timing, duration, modality of delivery, and disease model.",1
"Context:About half of adolescents aged 13 to 17 in United States are not fully vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV). As they age into young adulthood, colleges may be an excellent target population nexus for implementing interventions to improve HPV vaccination uptake.Objectives:Our study goal was to generate knowledge about HPV vaccine offerings and awareness programs at colleges to ascertain the extent of campus-facilitated access to HPV immunization and education in 1 state.Design:An electronic survey was designed and emailed to 32 of 47 Maryland colleges for which relevant campus contacts could be identified.Settings:The study took place at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in consultation with the Maryland Cancer Collaborative and the Maryland Department of Health.Participants:Maryland colleges and universitiesMain Outcome Measures:HPV vaccine and awareness program offerings on college and university campuses.Results:Twenty Maryland colleges responded. Two colleges offer awareness programs only. Ten colleges offer HPV vaccine, covering about 39% of Maryland college students. Of these, 4 colleges schedule “periodic” campus health clinics or provide an immunization prescription, which is filled at nearby pharmacies. In all colleges, which offer HPV vaccine, immunization is offered to everyone (both men and women) at no out-of-pocket cost.Conclusions:In cooperation with the Maryland Cancer Collaborative, the implementation arm for the Maryland Cancer Control Plan, we showed that college campuses are an excellent target site for implementation of interventions to improve access of college age students to HPV vaccine and awareness programs. We lay the groundwork for recommendations, programs and policies that can improve HPV vaccine offerings among college students thus raising the HPV vaccination rate in young adults. Simple inexpensive alternatives to offering vaccine at college health centers may be periodic campus health clinics and arrangements with nearby pharmacies.","Cancer cells modulate their metabolism, creating an acidic microenvironment that, in turn, can favor tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance. Tumor cells adopt strategies to survive a drop in extracellular pH (pHe). In the present manuscript, we investigated the contribution of mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) to the adaptation and survival of cancer cells to a low pHe. SIRT3-overexpressing and silenced breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were grown in buffered and unbuffered media at pH 7.4 and 6.8 for different times. mRNA expression of SIRT3 and CAVB, was measured by RT-PCR. Protein expression of SIRT3, CAVB and autophagy proteins was estimated by western blot. SIRT3-CAVB interaction was determined by immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (PLA). Induction of autophagy was studied by western blot and TEM. SIRT3 overexpression increases the survival of both cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrated that SIRT3 controls intracellular pH (pHi) through the regulation of mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase VB (CAVB). Interestingly, we obtained similar results by using MC2791, a new SIRT3 activator. Our results point to the possibility of modulating SIRT3 to decrease the response and resistance of tumor cells to the acidic microenvironment and ameliorate the effectiveness of anticancer therapy.",0
"PurposeTo compare the toxicity and clinical efficacy of TL (docetaxel + lobaplatin) induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy and TPF (docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Methods and patientsIn total, 128 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled between August 2016 and April 2021. They were randomly divided into trial group and control group, all using chronological dosage mode. The trial group used TL regimen induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy; the control group used TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The endpoints were adverse events and survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years.ResultsMedian follow-up was 42 months (20–71 months).  Adverse events: During induction chemotherapy, compared with TPF group, grade 3–4 leukocytes and neutrophils, diarrhea, 1–2 hyperbilirubinemia, nausea / vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, hyponatremia were significantly lower in TL group (p<0. 05): 6% vs. 35%, 14% vs. 53%, 0% vs. 6%, 15% vs. 40%, 9% vs. 56%, 0% vs. 10%, 3% vs. 13%, 2% vs. 23%, 15% vs. 74%. During chemoradiotherapy, the incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalaemia and grade 1–2 nausea was significantly lower in the TL group (p<0. 05), with 24% vs. 69%, 20% vs. 65% and 24% vs. 44%, respectively. However, more grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia were observed in the TL group (15% vs. 3%, p<0. 05).  There was no significant difference in the recent objective response rate (ORR) between patients with TL group and TPF group (p=0.961).  There was no statistical difference in 1, 3 and 5 years OS between TL group and TPF group, respectively, (71.0% vs. 67.5%, p=0.573), (56.6% vs. 56.9%, p=0.814), (52.5% vs. 52.9%, p=0.841); 1, 3 and 5 years PFS are: (63.4% vs. 64.0%, p=0.883), (51.1% vs. 54.0%, p=0.705) and (47.3% vs. 45.9%, p=0.887), None of them were significantly different. Multivariate analysis of COX regression showed that T stage (p=0.01) and surgery (p=0.046) were independent factors affecting PFS and OS, respectively. OS subgroup analysis shows that people receiving the TL regimen in postoperative and nodal stage N1 and N2 patients tended to survive longer than those receiving the TPF regimen.ConclusionPatients with postoperative, N1 or N2 stage locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may have more significant clinical benefits when treated with TL regimen. TL regimen has advantages in reducing toxic side effects and can be used as one of the first-line treatment options.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03117257).","BackgroundThe advantages of radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) depend on the radiation sensitivity of the patient. Here, we established and verified radiological factor-related gene signature and built a prognostic risk model to predict whether radiotherapy would be beneficial.MethodsData from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus, and RadAtlas databases were subjected to LASSO regression, univariate COX regression, and multivariate COX regression analyses to integrate genomic and clinical information from patients with HNSCC. HNSCC radiation-related prognostic genes were identified, and patients classified into high- and low-risk groups, based on risk scores. Variations in radiation sensitivity according to immunological microenvironment, functional pathways, and immunotherapy response were investigated. Finally, the expression of HNSCC radiation-related genes was verified by qRT-PCR.ResultsWe built a clinical risk prediction model comprising a 15-gene signature and used it to divide patients into two groups based on their susceptibility to radiation: radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant. Overall survival was significantly greater in the radiation-sensitive than the radiation-resistant group. Further, our model was an independent predictor of radiotherapy response, outperforming other clinical parameters, and could be combined with tumor mutational burden, to identify the target population with good predictive value for prognosis at 1, 2, and 3 years. Additionally, the radiation-resistant group was more vulnerable to low levels of immune infiltration, which are significantly associated with DNA damage repair, hypoxia, and cell cycle regulation. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion scores also suggested that the resistant group would respond less favorably to immunotherapy.ConclusionsOur prognostic model based on a radiation-related gene signature has potential for application as a tool for risk stratification of radiation therapy for patients with HNSCC, helping to identify candidates for radiation therapy and overcome radiation resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05304-x.",1
"Kidney failure, the decrease of kidney function below a threshold necessary to support life, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 406,504 individuals in the UK Biobank, identifying 430 loci affecting kidney function in middle-aged adults. To investigate the cell types affected by these loci, we integrated the GWAS with human kidney candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) identified using scATAC-seq. 56% of kidney function heritability localized to kidney tubule epithelial cCREs and an additional 7% to kidney podocyte cCREs. Thus, most heritable differences in adult kidney function are due to altered gene expression in these two cell types. Using enhancer assays, allele-specific scATACseq and machine learning, we found that many kidney function variants alter tubule epithelial cCRE chromatin accessibility and function. Using CRISPRi, we determined which genes some of these cCREs regulate, implicating NDRG1, CCNB1 and STC1 in human kidney function.","PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of main tumor resection on long-term survival compared with pleural biopsy alone in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were intraoperatively diagnosed with pleural metastasis.Materials and MethodsA total of 176 patients with adenocarcinoma who had unexpected pleural metastasis detected during surgery from 2002 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Each surgeon decided whether to perform main tumor resection or pleural biopsy alone.ResultsThe patients were grouped based on the surgical approaches: main tumor resection (resection group; n=83) and pleural biopsy only (O&C group; n=93). The resection group had better overall survival (OS; 10-year survival, 27.9% vs. 9.4%; median survival, 68.3 vs. 36.6 months; p < 0.01) and locoregional progression-free survival (10-year survival, 12.5% vs. 7.1%; median survival, 19.6 vs. 10.6 months; p < 0.01) than the O&C group. Similar results were found for OS in patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line therapy (10-year survival, 49.2% vs. 15.0%; median survival, 72.2 vs. 45.4 months; p=0.03), patients who did not undergo TKIs treatment (10-year survival, 29.4% vs. 9.2%; median survival, 82.4 vs. 23.8 months; p < 0.01), and patients with positive target gene mutation (10-year survival, 31.7% vs. 10.1%; median survival, 72.2 vs. 33.7 months; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, pleural biopsy only (hazard ratio, 1.73; p=0.04) was a significant predictor of OS.ConclusionMain tumor resection can improve survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who had unexpected pleural metastasis during operation.",0
"Cisplatin resistance is one of the major causes of treatment failure in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There is an urgent need to uncover the underlying mechanism for developing effective treatment strategies. A quantitative proteomics assay was used to identify differential proteins in cisplatin-resistant cells. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I (TOP1MT) localization was determined using laser confocal microscopy and nucleocytoplasmic separation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to identify the interaction between pseudogenes, miRNAs, and real genes. In vivo experiments verified the interaction between TOP1MT and pseudogenes on cisplatin resistance. TOP1MT was identified as a driving factor of cisplatin resistance in vitro, in vivo, and in HNSCC patients. Moreover, TOP1MT exceptionally translocated to the nucleus in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells in a signal peptide–dependent manner. Nuclear TOP1MT (nTOP1MT) transcriptionally regulated the mitochondrial functional pseudogene MTATP6P1, which bound to miR-137 and miR-491-5p as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and promoted the expression of MTATP6. An increase in MTATP6 enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which conferred cisplatin resistance in HNSCC. Our findings revealed that nTOP1MT transcriptionally activated MTAPT6P1 and increased MTATP6 expression via ceRNA, which facilitated OXPHOS and cisplatin resistance. These results provide novel insight for overcoming cisplatin resistance in HNSCC.","Aim: Certain cancer cells depend on oxidative phosphorylation for survival; thus, inhibiting this process may be a promising treatment strategy. This study explored the structure–activity relationships of the mitochondrial inhibitor N-ethylene glycol-comprising alkyl thiophene-3-carboxamide 3.Methods & results: We synthesized and evaluated 13 analogs (5a–m) with different ethylene glycol units, heterocycles and connecting groups for their growth-inhibitory effects on A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells. We found that increasing the number of ethylene glycol units significantly enhanced inhibitory activity. Some analogs activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, similar to 3. Notably, analog 5e, which contains tetraethylene glycol units, significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo.Conclusion: Analog 5 may be a potential therapeutic agent for non-small cell lung cancer treatment.",1
"AbstractBackgroundWe examined the relationship between neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cognition in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at baseline and longitudinally.MethodsPlasma and clinical data were available from virally suppressed people with HIV (PWH) aged ≥45 years in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group HAILO study. Four neuropsychological assessments standardized and averaged (NPZ-4) represented cognition. Plasma collection date marked baseline; slope summarized longitudinal NPZ-4 changes. Linear regressions examined biomarkers associations with baseline NPZ-4 and longitudinal change.ResultsThe study included 503 participants with a median age of 52 (interquartile range [IQR, 48–57]) years and observation of 6 (IQR, 5–7) years, and 26% had baseline cognitive impairment defined by HAILO. Cross-sectionally, higher NfL (β = −.76, P < .01) and GFAP (β = −.44, P = .02) were associated with worse NPZ-4. Longitudinally, the median NPZ-4 slope was 0.003 (IQR, −0.06 to 0.06) units/year with 48% demonstrating cognitive decline. Higher NfL (β = −.08, P < .01), but not GFAP (β = −.03, P = .08), was associated with cognitive decline.ConclusionsNfL and GFAP were associated with worse cognition cross-sectionally; only NfL was associated with cognitive decline. Their clinical utility remains uncertain given small effect sizes and should be studied in populations with more rapid decline.","Introduction.Among older adults without cancer, living alone is associated with poor health outcomes. However, among older adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who live alone, data on function, cognition, and quality of life (QOL) during systemic treatment remain limited.Materials and Methods.We enrolled adults aged ≥65 with advanced NSCLC starting a new chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted therapy regimen with non-curative intent. Patients completed geriatric assessments including instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and QOL pretreatment and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months, or until treatment discontinuation, whichever occurred earlier. We categorized change in IADL, cognition, and QOL as stable/improved, declined with recovery, or declined without recovery using clinically meaningful definitions of change. We used multinomial logistic regression to compare change between patients who lived alone versus with others.Results.Among 149 patients, median age was 73; 21% lived alone. Pretreatment IADL, cognition, and QOL scores were similar between older adults who lived alone versus with others. During NSCLC treatment, older adults who lived alone had similar trajectories of function (52% functional decline vs 38%), cognition (43% cognitive decline vs 50%), and QOL (45% QOL decline vs 44%) compared with those who lived with others. In unadjusted analyses, patients who lived alone were more likely to develop functional decline with recovery (reference category: stable/improved function) than those who lived with others (relative risk ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.14-14.6, p=0.03). However, this association was not observed after adjusting for age, race, prior NSCLC treatment, current treatment group, and pretreatment geriatric assessment differences. There were no differences in cognitive or QOL trajectories in unadjusted or adjusted analyses.Discussion.Approximately half of older adults with advanced NSCLC who lived alone were able to maintain their function, cognition, and QOL during NSCLC treatment, which was similar to older adults who lived with others. Many older adults with advanced NSCLC who live alone can receive systemic treatment with individualized supportive care.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown significant efficacy in hematological diseases. However, CAR T therapy has demonstrated limited efficacy in solid tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). One of the most important reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune cells used to eliminate tumor cells. The human transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) plays a crucial role in forming the suppressive GBM TME and driving the suppression of the anti-GBM response. To mitigate TGF-β-mediated suppressive activity, we combined a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor II (dnTGFβRII) with our previous bicistronic CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 construct, currently being evaluated in a clinical trial, to generate CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII, a tri-modular construct we are developing for clinical application. We hypothesized that this approach would more effectively subvert resistance mechanisms observed with GBM. Our data suggest that CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII significantly augments T cell proliferation, enhances functional responses, and improves the fitness of bystander cells, particularly by decreasing the TGF-β concentration in a TGF-β-rich TME. In addition, in vivo studies validate the safety and efficacy of the dnTGFβRII cooperating with CARs in targeting and eradicating GBM in an NSG mouse model.","PurposeBurkitt lymphoma (BL) is one of the most frequent subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children. Currently, short, intensive chemotherapy is used internationally and has greatly improved survival in children with BL. However, 5–10% of patients suffer recurrence after intensive chemotherapy, and the prognosis of these patients remains poor. The overall survival rate is only approximately 10%. Innovative therapies are needed to attain a higher rate of remission, such as immunotherapy for relapsed refractory (r/r) BL patients.MethodsAn 8-year-old boy with BL was studied. He suffered a relapse after treatment with standard chemotherapy. Then, we treated this patient using autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, sequentially targeting antigens CD19, CD22, and CD20. A review of the current literature on CAR-T treatment for lymphoma is presented.ResultsThe patient had no discernible response to anti-CD19 CAR-T treatment and exhibited progressive disease (PD). Following CD-22-directed CAR-T treatment, the patient underwent a partial remission (PR), but unfortunately a relapse rapidly occurred. Finally, after administering the anti-CD20 CAR-T cell therapy, the child went into complete remission (CR). The young boy has currently achieved 16-month event-free survival (EFS) so far. During administration of the CD19 and CD20 CAR-T cells, the patient appeared to experience mild (Grade I) cytokine release syndrome (CRS). However, during the CD22 CAR-T therapy, he appeared to experience grade III CRS.ConclusionAutologous anti-CD19, anti-CD22, and anti-CD20 CAR-T cell therapies targeting multiple tumor antigens could be an innovative and sound treatment for children with r/r BL, provided that they are closely monitored during treatment.",1
"AbstractHematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a serine-threonine kinase specific to hematopoiesis and a member of the MAP4K family of Ste20-related protein kinases. Targeting HPK1 to ameliorate T cell exhaustion and enhance T cell functions is a promising strategy for clinical immunotherapies. Numerous studies have reported the progress in developing effective HPK1 inhibitors and elucidating their mechanisms of action. However, most inhibitors affect multiple signaling pathways, resulting in unintended side effects that limit their clinical development and application. Herein, we reviewed HPK1-related signaling pathways, clinical candidates and recent advances in small-molecule inhibitors targeting HPK1. Additionally, we present our perspectives on current challenges and potential future research field, hoping to provide inspiration for the development of novel HPK1 inhibitors.","Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) negatively affects T cell activation and proliferation and is a promising target for immunotherapy. Although HPK1 inhibitors have shown promising efficacy in preclinical models, none have been approved for clinical use. One significant challenge in developing an HPK1 inhibitor is the difficulty in designing a potent inhibitor with good kinase selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we report a series of spiro HPK1 inhibitors with good potency and selectivity. Specifically, compound 16 exhibited potent HPK1 inhibition (IC50 = 2.67 nM), adequate selectivity toward the MAP4K family (>100-fold), and good selectivity against selected kinases (>300-fold). Compound 16 demonstrated moderate in vivo clearance and reasonable oral exposure in mice and rats. Notably, compound 16 possessed good antitumor efficacy in the CT26 murine colon cancer and a synergistic effect when combined with anti-PD-1. These exciting preclinical results support the continued development of this class of HPK1 inhibitors.",1
"BackgroundThis study aimed to evaluate the potential role of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) in predicting oncological outcomes and postoperative complications in UTUC patients undergoing radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) and to develop a nomogram incorporating GNRI to predict outcomes.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on 458 consecutive patients who underwent RNU in our center. According to nutritional scores, patients were divided into the following groups: low GNRI (GNRI ≤ 98) and high GNRI (GNRI > 98). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to investigate the role of GNRI in predicting the perioperative complications. The survival was compared with Kaplan − Meier curve, and test by log-rank tests. Risk factors associated with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression model and were integrated into a nomogram for individualized risk prediction. The calibration and discrimination ability of the model were evaluated by concordance index (C-index) and risk group stratification.ResultsWhen compared with high GNRI, low GNRI had significantly lower survival (CSS, p < 0.001; OS, p < 0.001). Across all patients, multivariable analyses revealed that low GNRI was an independent prognostic factor (CSS, p = 0.007; OS, p = 0.005). Nomograms for 1-, 3-, and 5 years of CSS and OS had good performance. Patients can be stratified into different groups based on the nomogram, with significant differences in OS and CSS. Further, GNRI was also found to be an independent risk factor for postoperative complications. The complication − prediction nomogram based on GNRI was also internally validated and showed good performance.ConclusionsThe GNRI score is an independent predictor for the prognosis and postoperative complications of UTUC following RNU. This study presented a nomogram incorporating preoperative GNRI that might be used as a convenient tool to facilitate the preoperative individualized prediction of short- and long-term outcomes for patients with UTUC.","ObjectiveTo investigate the effects of cytokines IL-2 and GM-CSF on CXCR3 expression and chemotaxis of CAR-T cells.BackgroundHigh lymphocyte infiltration within the tumor is a basic requirement for good results in tumor immunotherapy; C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) is an important factor for the chemotaxis of lymphocytes to tumor tissues. The tumor microenvironment can exhibit diverse cytokine suppression or promote antitumor immunity. Both interleukin (IL)-2 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) contribute to the regulation of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. However, the effects of IL-2 and GM-CSF on CXCR3 expression on the T cell surface and its mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we explored the effects of polycytokines on CXCR3 expression in chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) and on HuH-7 in situ hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, followed by purifying using CD3 immunomagnetic beads. Cells were divided into three groups. After 24h of activation using CD3/CD28 antibody, T cells were transfected using lentiviral vector, pGC-SV40-EGFP-GPC3-CAR. Three culture methods were used to amplify the transfected T cells. Method ‘A’ was to incubate T cells with CD3/CD28 antibody; method ‘B’ was with CD3/CD28 antibody and IL-2 at a final concentration of 1000 U/ml; method ‘C’ was with method B in addition of GM-CSF at a final concentration of 1000 U/ml. The phosphorylation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT was determined by western blot. The chemotaxis effect of CAR-T cells on Huh-7 HCCIA in situ was assayed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry.ResultsThe CD3/CD28/IL-2/GM-CSF combination is the most potent for stimulating activated CAR-T cell proliferation and CXCR3 expression in vitro; CD3/CD28/IL-2 induces CAR-T cell expression of CXCR3 through the activation of the PI3K/APK pathway and GM-CSF induces CXCR3 expression in CAR-T cells through the activation of ERK1/2 rather than the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. CAR-GPC3-T cells with high CXCR3 expression showed increased chemotaxis ability to HuH in situ hepatocellular carcinoma, and considerably inhibited the growth of in situ tumors in nude mouse livers.ConclusionA multi-factorial amplification protocol can effectively improve CXCR3 expression on the surface of activated CAR-T cells in vitro, as well as enhance the chemotaxis ability of CAR-T cells in vivo, which significantly inhibit the growth of liver cancer.",0
"ObjectiveTo search for human protein-coding genes related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and perform prognosis risk assessment.MethodsGenes related to HBV-HCC were selected through literature screening and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network database analysis. Prognosis potential genes (PPGs) were identified using Cox regression analysis. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on PPGs, and risk scores were calculated. Kaplan–Meier plots were used to analyze overall survival rates, and the results were predicted based on clinicopathological variables. Association analysis was also conducted with immune infiltration, immune therapy, and drug sensitivity. Experimental verification of the expression of PPGs was done in patient liver cancer tissue and normal liver tissue adjacent to tumors.ResultsThe use of a prognosis potential genes risk assessment model can reliably predict the prognosis risk of patients, demonstrating strong predictive ability. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the overall survival rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than that of the high-risk group. There were significant differences between the two subgroups in terms of immune infiltration and IC50 association analysis. Experimental verification revealed that CYP2C19, FLNC, and HNRNPC were highly expressed in liver cancer tissue, while UBE3A was expressed at a lower level.ConclusionPPGs can be used to predict the prognosis risk of HBV-HCC patients and play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. They also reveal their potential role in the tumor immune microenvironment, clinical-pathological characteristics, and prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04989-4.","Although major progress has been made in the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for hematological malignancies, this method is ineffective against solid tumors largely because of the limited infiltration, activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells. To overcome this issue, we engineered CAR-T cells with synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors, which induce local tumor-specific secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading enzymes at the tumor site. SynNotch CAR-T cells achieve precise ECM recognition and robustly kill targeted tumors, with synNotch-induced enzyme production enabling the degradation of components of the tumor ECM. In addition, this regulation strongly increased the infiltration of CAR-T cells and the clearance of solid tumors, resulting in tumor regression without toxicity in vivo. Notably, synNotch CAR-T cells also promoted the persistent activation of CAR-T cells in patient-derived tumor organoids. Thus, we constructed a synthetic T-cell system that increases the infiltration and antitumor function of CAR-T cells, providing a strategy for targeting ECM-rich solid tumors.",0
"PurposeCell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma enables rapid and repeat testing of actionable mutations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an attractive platform for multiplex sequencing capabilities compared to traditional methods such as PCR. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of the NGS-based ctDNA assay and to identify the genomic alteration profile of ctDNA in real-world Chinese non-small cell lung (NSCLC) patients.MethodsIn total, 294 Chinese patients with pathological diagnosis of Phase III-IV NSCLC were enrolled. 3–4 mL peripheral blood was collected and NGS-based analysis was carried out using a 20-gene panel. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA NGS-based assay was validated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).ResultsWe have tested 570 sites from 286 samples using ddPCR, which included 108 positive sites and 462 negative sites from NGS results, and the concordance rate was 99.8% (418/419) for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 96.7% (146/151) for insertions and deletions (InDels). The most frequent genes were TP53 (32%), EGFR (31.97%), KRAS (6.46%), PIK3CA (4.76%), and MET (4.08%). Exon 19 deletion (19del) was the most common alteration in EGFR and G12C was the most common alteration in KRAS. Furthermore, the detection rate of TP53 was higher in the male and patients with squamous cell carcinoma. We also found the prevalence of TP53 in L858R was higher than in 19del (61.29% vs. 40%; p = 0.1115).ConclusionThe results indicate that the results of NGS-based ctDNA assay are highly consistent with ddPCR. In Chinese NSCLC patients, TP53 mutation was more frequently associated with male and squamous cell carcinoma. The prevalence of concomitant mutations in L858R may be different from that in 19del.","IntroductionTracing the histological origin of metastatic renal cancer (MRC) and locating the pathological root cause lead to precise treatment and improved prognosis.Material and methodsA total of 3336 patient cases with clear tissue origins from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were screened as experimental data material and feature selection was performed using the differential expression method; the random forest (RF) algorithm was improved to establish a medical retrospective heterogeneous filtered feature selection random forest weighted (ReliefFk_RFw) model to locate tissue origins.ResultsThe differential expression analysis method screened 60 signature genes with good differential expression for tracing tissue origins (kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma). Compared with traditional machine learning (support vector machine, decision tree, RF) models, the ReliefFk_RFw algorithm increased the average accuracy from 98.65%, 98.79% and 98.57% to 99.53%, the average precision from 95.58%, 96.40% and 96.54% to 99.36%, and the average sensitivity from 97.03%, 96.61% and 96.76% to 98.89%, mean specificity from 99.50%, 99.39% and 99.35% to 99.90%, and mean F1 score from 96.30%, 96.50% and 96.64% to 99.11%. The highest accuracy in localizing the origin of primary pancreatic cancer was achieved with 100.00% for different models of retrospective metrics.ConclusionsThe improved ReliefFk_RFw model is best for comprehensive assessment and can be used to trace the origin of MRC tissue to assist physicians in diagnosis and treatment.",0
"Purpose Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. To improve the therapeutic outcomes, drug delivery systems, and particularly liposomes, have been widely investigated. Therefore, this review analyzed systematically the literature to inquire about the safety and efficacy of liposomal formulations in lung cancer treatment.MethodsThree electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL) were systematically searched until May 2020. Clinical trials containing information about the effects of liposomal formulations in lung cancer patients were considered eligible.ResultsTwenty two selected studies present different treatment options for both small and non-small-cell lung cancers. After compiling and analyzing all the published information, we verified that combination of liposomal cisplatin and paclitaxel led to a statistically significant improvement of the evaluated outcomes. Moreover, tecemotide, a liposome-based immunotherapy, demonstrated lower toxicity compared to control groups. Evidences that other subgroups could benefit from this formulation were also provided.ConclusionThis systematic review (registration number CRD42021246587) demonstrates that liposomal formulations are promising alternatives to overcome limitations of traditional cancer therapy. However, larger, longer, randomized and double-blinded clinical trials, selecting their patients’ cohort considering more responsive subgroups would be beneficial to strengthen the scientific and clinical evidence of the results herein reported.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04079-x.","BackgroundNon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common malignant lung tumor and is difficult to be eradicated due to its immunosuppressive microenvironment. Chlorin e6 (Ce6)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) could improve immunogenicity while destroying malignant tumor cells. However, the clinic application of Ce6-mediated PDT is limited by Ce6’s poor water solubility and insufficient accumulation in lung cancer. To address this issue, Ce6 was loaded onto functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles linked with glucose to improve the distribution of Ce6 in lung cancer.Materials and resultsThe results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–Vis spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy confirmed the successful preparation of the composites. Confocal and flow cytometry showed IO–PG–GLU–Ce6 significantly enhanced the uptake of Ce6 by lung cancer cells and produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS) under NIR light irradiation. In addition, the detection of cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis indicated IO–PG–GLU–Ce6 achieved stronger photo-toxicity to lung cancer cells. Moreover, IO–PG–GLU–Ce6 treatment effectively damaged the DNA of lung cancer cells and thereby activated STING, up-regulated the expression of IFN-β, HMGB1 and HSP90, indicating augmented immunogenicity of lung cancer cells. Further results of in vivo, organ imaging and tissue fluorescence sections demonstrated IO–PG–GLU–Ce6 significantly improved the distribution of Ce6 in tumor tissues of lung cancer-bearing mice as well. Finally, the findings of in vivo study and immunohistochemistry confirmed the better efficacy of IO–PG–GLU–Ce6. HE staining results of vital organs suggested that the composites were less toxic.ConclusionIn conclusion, Ce6 loaded by functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles linked with glucose exhibited both target photodynamic efficacy and the ability to enhance its immunogenicity in lung cancer. This study provides a promising strategy for augment of the targeting delivery of Ce6 and its mediated photodynamic and immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03879-x.",1
"Background:Modern treatment strategies have markedly improved the chances of survival for patients with cancer. As the population ages, cancer is becoming more common, as is chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD increases the risk of cancer; conversely, cancer treatments can cause CKD.Methods:This review is based on publications retrieved by a selective literature search concerning the epidemiology and comorbidities of cancer and kidney diseases, the renal side effects of new anticancer drugs, and the need to consider renal function in cancer treatment.Results:The prevalence of severe CKD in Germany is 2.3%. Persons who have CKD, are on dialysis, or have undergone kidney transplantation are 1.2 to 3.5 times more likely to develop cancer than the general population. For patients who have CKD or are dialysis-dependent, the doses of approximately 67% of anticancer drugs need to be adjusted on the basis of their glomerular filtration rate and the renally excreted fraction of the drug. The optimal efficacy of therapeutic drugs, as well as of those used for diagnostic purposes, and the minimization of side effects, depend critically on adapted dosing and on proper timing of administration before or after dialysis. Modern anticancer drugs can also cause acute kidney damage (incidence with checkpoint inhibitors: 2–16%).Conclusion:Patients who have CKD, are on dialysis, or have undergone kidney transplantation make up a considerable fraction of persons being treated for cancer, and they need interdisciplinary treatment.","SummaryPathologists play a central role in RCC patient care by confirming the diagnosis of malignancy, determining the histologic type of RCC, and assessing many important prognostic factors such as the pathological stage, nuclear grade, presence of sarcomatoid or rhabdoid features, and others. In recent years, our increased understanding of the molecular alterations driving specific RCC types has led to an improved classification scheme that better informs patient prognosis and treatment. In spite of this progress, no predictive biomarkers are currently approved for the management of patients with RCC. Pathologists are uniquely positioned to move the field forward by developing IHC/mIF-based predictors of outcome to ICI-based therapy that could be utilized in the clinic.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundRecently, we developed AT101, an IgM-class mouse monoclonal antibody directed against glypican-1 (GPC1), a proteoglycan that can be considered as useful target for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment being specifically and highly expressed on GBM cell surface. Here, we proposed the use of AT101 as targeting agent in a drug delivery nanoplatfom to effectively deliver chitosan nanobubbles (NBs) for GBM treatment.MethodsChitosan NBs were prepared and conjugated with AT101 or left unconjugated as control.ResultsThe ability of AT101 to bind the GPC1 protein was demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis in the “GBM-like” GPC1-expressing cell lines U-87 MG and T98G. AT101 was shown to bind GPC1-expressing GBM tumor samples by immunofluorescence. In-vivo experiments in the U-87 MG xenograft model showed that AT101 was able to bind GPC1 on cell surface and accumulate in U-87 MG tumor masses (p = 0.0002 respect to control). Moreover, in-vivo experiments showed that AT101 is able to target GPC1 when conjugated to chitosan NBs, thus increasing their specific deliver to GPC1-expressing cells of U-87 MG tumor, as compared to chitosan NBs not conjugated to AT101 (p = 0.02).ConclusionsAT101 is an useful targeting agent for the development of drug delivery nanoplatforms for GBM treatment.","PURPOSE:The primary objective of this study is to quantify the use of off-label molecularly targeted therapy and describe the clinical situations in which off-label targeted therapy are utilized. A key secondary objective is to report the outcomes of patients treated with off-label use of targeted therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS:We searched the electronic health record between 2000–2020 at our center to characterize the volume, clinical settings, and outcomes associated with off-label use of targeted therapies in different types of solid tumors.RESULTS:Among 46,712 patients who received targeted therapies, we identified 119 instances of off-label use of targeted therapy. Colon cancer was the most common cancer type to receive off-label targeted therapy in 18 patients (15.1%), followed by 13 with non-small cell lung cancer (10.9%), 8 with cholangiocarcinoma (6.7%), and 7 with glioblastoma (5.9%). The most frequent molecular rationale for off-label therapy came from a comprehensive next-generation sequencing test (53.7%). The most frequently mutated gene that provided the rationale for targeted therapy was BRAF (20.1%), with BRAFV600E being the most common molecular alteration overall (15.1%). The median duration of off-label targeted therapy was 3.58 months, and the overall survival of treated patients was 7.59 months. There were 37 patients (31.1%) treated for longer than 6 months, 23 patients (19.3%) who survived ≥2 years, and 13 patients who were still on therapy as of June 2020.CONCLUSION:In this large cohort study of patients with solid tumors, off-label use of targeted therapy was uncommon. With that said, a notable proportion of patients had treatment durations ≥6 months and survivals of ≥2 years.",1
"BackgroundResistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a pervasive barrier in TKIs therapy for EGFR/ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy has exhibited an encouraging anti-tumor activity in high-selected EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to TKI therapy. However, the effect of ICI plus chemotherapy therapy on those with brain metastases in this subset of patients is still unknown.MethodsFrom April 2019 to August 2021, EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who progressed after previous EGFR/ALK-TKIs with brain metastases and received ICI plus chemotherapy ± bevacizumab at Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) were included. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy, toxicity and progression site after ICI treatment.ResultsA total of 19 patients were included in the study, including 16 (84.4%) patients with EGFR mutations, 2 (10.5%) with ALK translocations and 1 (5.3%) with RET rearrangement. All of the patients progressed after previous TKI therapy and had brain metastatic lesions when received ICI combination therapy. The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 15.8 and 57.9%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.7 months (95% confidence interval CI 0.43–8.96) and 19.2 months (95% CI 15.08–23.29), respectively. The intracranial ORR was 10.5% and extracranial ORR was 15.8%, and the intracranial and extracranial DCR were 68.4 and 63.2%, respectively. The most common progression pattern was extracranial failure, and primary lesions enlargement rather than new sites metastases accounted for the vast majority of progressions. The most common grade 3–4 adverse event (AE) was leukopenia (31.6%), followed by neutropenia (26.3%), thrombocytopenia (10.5%) and rash (5.3%) successively. No grade 5 AE and discontinuation of ICI therapy for severe AEs were observed.ConclusionsICI combined with chemotherapy ± bevacizumab might be effective and safe for EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC patients who progressed after previous TKI therapy, and synergistic anti-tumor activity for brain metastases was also observed.","PurposeCancer vaccine (CV) has thrived as a promising tool for cancer prevention and treatment. However, how to maintain the integrity and diversity of individualized vaccine antigens and activate the adaptive immune system is still challenging.MethodsHerein, a preventive and therapeutic vaccine platform for in situ effective multi-model synergistic therapy is developed. In our study, we process B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen (LNF) to obtain LNF cells, the characterization of LNF cells were conducted. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect and immune activation ability were studied, and the role as a CV were investigated.ResultsThe LNF cells preserve intact cellular structure and tumor-associated self-antigen gp100. Moreover, LNF cells have the ability of loading and releasing doxorubicin (DOX). Except for the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy brought by DOX, the LNF cells can promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and induce immune response by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly with the existence of adjuvant, R848. Specifically, the CD8+ T cells of mice in LNF-DOX/R848 group are 6 times of that in PBS group in tumor microenvironment, and twice in spleen. Therefore, LNF cells can also be utilized as a CV. Vaccination with LNF/R848 cells effectively suppress the tumor growth in mice by fivefold as compared to the control group.ConclusionIn this work, we obtain the LNF cells with a simple procedure. The LNF cells not only provides a tumor cells-based multi-modal system for cancer therapy but inspires new insights into future development of individualized CVs strategies.Graphical AbstractThis study processes live B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen to obtain LNF cells, which preserve cell integrity and homologous targeting ability. The LNF cells can load and deliver drug and can serve as tumor vaccine. Results demonstrated the LNF cells have effective prophylactic ability, and ideal anti-tumor ability with the loaded drug and adjuvant.

"PurposeThe regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subpopulation of lymphocytes that suppress the immune responses. The prognostic value of Tregs in lymphoma patients remains controversial. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the role of Tregs in the prognosis of lymphoma patients.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to obtain eligible studies that evaluated the prognostic factor of Tregs for lymphoma patients. Hazards ratios (HRs) with the matching 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were merged to estimate the prognostic value of Tregs.ResultsWe finally retrieved 23 eligible studies, including a total of 2269 patients. The overall pooled analysis on all types of lymphomas showed that Tregs had a significantly positive association with prolonged overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.633, 95% CI 0.528–0.758) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.451, 95% CI 0.261–0.779). Subgroup analysis indicated that high Tregs were significantly correlated with longer OS in Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and natural killer/T cell lymphoma. However, there was no significant association of Tregs with T cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.ConclusionsIncreased Tregs indicates a better prognosis for patients with lymphoma. Tregs could be used as a valuable prognostic biomarker of lymphoma patients.","BackgroundAlthough neoadjuvant immunotherapy is being widely studied, there is no consensus on its efficacy in microsatellite-stable (MSS) or mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate studies on neoadjuvant immunotherapy for advanced CRC to assess its efficacy and provide new clinical guidelines.MethodsWe searched literature databases to identify studies that assessed the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced CRC. The outcomes evaluated were pathological complete response (pCR), major pathological response (MPR), R0 resection, and anal preservation rates. Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed by sensitivity analysis, and publication bias was evaluated using Begg and Egger tests.ResultsEleven articles were included in the analysis. The pCR, MPR, R0 resection, and anal preservation rates reported in these studies were 39 and 49, 97, and 76%, respectively. The MSI-H and MSS groups had pooled pCR rates of 70 and 24%, respectively. The pCR rates for the induction, consolidation, and concurrent immuno-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) subgroups were 43, 33, and 27%, respectively, and those for the single and double immunotherapy subgroups were 34 and 40%, respectively.ConclusionNeoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with CRT is effective in treating MSI-H/dMMR advanced CRC. It could also be a new first-line therapeutic option for MSS/pMMR advanced CRC.",1
"BackgroundNeoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) using the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) protocol has improved esophageal cancer outcomes. This study reports the real-world experience of the CROSS regimen for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) regarding its feasibility, safety, and predictors of treatment completion from an Indian tertiary center.MethodologyA retrospective review was conducted for patients with ESCC receiving CROSS (radiation dose: 41.4 Gy) or a modified CROSS (mCROSS; radiation dose: 45 Gy) protocol NACRT between 2015 and 2022. We studied the treatment tolerability, factors predicting NACRT completion, and the effect of completion of its chemotherapy component on the pathological outcomes.Results Of the109 patients (68.8% males; mean age, 56 ± 9 years; Charlson's comorbidity index [CCI] >2, 19.3%; stage III–IVA, 58%; mean tumor length, 5.5 ± 2.1cm; CROSS, 70.6%; mCROSS, 29.4%), all except 4 completed radiotherapy but only 58 (53.2%) patients completed ≥4 cycles of chemotherapy. Forty-nine patients belonged to the “extended” CROSS trial inclusion criteria. Among the 60 patients who fulfilled the CROSS inclusion criteria, only 51.7% were able to complete ≥4 chemotherapy cycles. The commonest reason for noncompletion of chemotherapy was the occurrence of neutropenia (60.8%). Pretreatment hemoglobin (≥12 vs. <12 g%; odds ratio [OR]: 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–6.96; p = 0.031), a low CCI (≤2 vs. >2; OR: 2.98; 95% CI: 1.02–8.73; p = 0.047), and radiation therapy techniques (conformal vs. conventional; OR: 3.29; 95% CI: 1.14–9.50; p = 0.028) were associated with completion of chemotherapy (≥4 cycles). Although there was a trend toward improved R0 resection (95.7 vs. 91.4%), reduced node positivity (17.0 vs. 31.4%), and a high pCR (57.4 vs. 48.6%) in patients completing chemotherapy (≥4 cycles) compared with those not completing chemotherapy (<4 cycles), these differences were statistically nonsignificant. ConclusionIn this study, ESCC patients receiving the CROSS protocol NACRT could complete their radiotherapy component, but a significant proportion exhibited poor chemotherapy tolerance. Neutropenia was a major factor limiting chemotherapy delivery, but anemia, high CCI, and conventional radiation techniques were also associated with noncompletion of chemotherapy. The omission of a few chemotherapy cycles had no significant effect on the pathological response; however, its impact on cancer survival requires further evaluation.","SummaryMaximum likelihood inference can often become computationally intensive when performing joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data, due to the intractable integrals in the joint likelihood function. The computational challenges escalate further when modeling HIV-1 viral load data, owing to the nonlinear trajectories and the presence of left-censored data resulting from the assay’s lower limit of quantification. In this paper, for a joint model comprising a nonlinear mixed-effect model and a Cox Proportional Hazards model, we develop a computationally efficient Stochastic EM (StEM) algorithm for parameter estimation. Furthermore, we propose a novel technique for fast standard error estimation, which directly estimates standard errors from the results of StEM iterations and is broadly applicable to various joint modeling settings, such as those containing generalized linear mixed-effect models, parametric survival models, or joint models with more than two submodels. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply them to HIV-1 viral load data from six AIDS Clinical Trials Group studies to characterize viral rebound trajectories following the interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART), accounting for the informative duration of off-ART periods.",0
"CLIC5 encoded protein associates with actin-based cytoskeletal and is increasingly thought to play significant roles in human cancers. We use TCGA and GEO to explore CLIC5 expression differences, mutation and DNA methylation, TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration. We verified the mRNA expression of CLIC5 in human ovarian cancer cells by real-time PCR and detected the expression of CLIC5 as well as immune marker genes in ovarian cancer by immunohistochemistry. The pan-cancer analysis showed that CLIC5 is highly expressed in several malignant tumors. In some cancers, CLIC5 expression in tumor samples is associated with poorer overall survival. For example, patients with ovarian cancer with high expression of CLIC5 have a poor prognosis. CLIC5 mutation frequency increased in all tumor types. The CLIC5 promoter is hypomethylated in most tumors. CLIC5 was associated with tumor immunity and different immune cells of different tumor types, such as CD8 + T cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, etc. CLIC5 was positively correlated with various immune checkpoints, and TMB and MSI were correlated with dysregulation of CLIC5 in tumors. The expression of CLIC5 in ovarian cancer was detected by qPCR and IHC, and the results were consistent with the bioinformatics results. There were a strong positive correlation between CLIC5 expression and M2 macrophage (CD163) infiltration and a negative correlation with CD8 + T-cell infiltration. In conclusions, our first pan-cancer analysis offered a detailed grasp of the cancerogenic functions of CLIC5 in a variety of malignancies. CLIC5 participated in immunomodulation and performed a crucial function in the tumor microenvironment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04927-4.","PurposeColon cancer is highly heterogeneous in terms of the immune and stromal microenvironment, genomic integrity, and oncogenic properties; therefore, molecular subtypes of the four characteristic dimensions are expected to provide novel clues for immunotherapy of colon cancer.MethodsAccording to the enrichment of four dimensions, we performed consensus cluster analysis and identified three robust molecular subtypes for colon cancer, namely immune enriched, immune deficiency, and stroma enriched. We characterized and validated the immune infiltration, gene mutations, copy number variants, methylation, protein expression, and clinical features in different datasets. Finally, we developed an 8-gene risk prognostic model and proposed the innovative RiskScore. In addition, a nomogram model was constructed combining clinical characteristics and RiskScore to validate its excellent clinical predictive power.ResultsCombining clinical patient tissue samples and histochemical microarray data, we found that high FMOD expression in tumor epithelial cells was associated with poorer patient prognosis, but FMOD expression in the mesenchyme was not associated with prognosis. In pan-cancer, RiskScore, a prognostic model constructed based on characteristic pathway scores, was a poor prognostic factor for malignancy and was negatively associated with immunotherapy response.ConclusionThe identification of molecular subtypes could provide innovative ideas for immunotherapy of colon cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05163-6.",1
"ABSTRACTLymphoma, a blood tumor, has become the ninth most common cancer in the world in 2020. Targeted inhibition is one of the important treatments for lymphoma. At present, there are many kinds of targeted drugs for the treatment of lymphoma. Studies have shown that Histone deacetylase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase all play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors and become important and promising inhibitory targets. This article mainly expounds the important role of these target protein in tumors, and introduces the mechanism of action, structure–activity relationship and clinical research of listed small molecule inhibitors of these targets, hoping to provide new ideas for the treatment of lymphoma.","Background: Low serum sodium affects cancer prognosis, but its impact on immunotherapy is unclear.Objective: Assessing the association of pre- and post-ICI treatment sodium levels with survival.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients receiving ICI in January 2012–December 2023, collecting serum sodium levels at treatment initiation and 4 weeks post-ICI, with overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome.Results: Low sodium was observed in 125 and 119 patients pre-and post-treatment respectively. Pre-ICI and post-ICI low sodium correlated with decreased OS [10.6 vs. 22.9 months (p = 0.001) and 11.6 vs. 27.2 months (p = 0.009)]. Multivariate analysis identified pre-ICI low sodium [HR: 1.685; 95% CI: 1.050–2.705; p = 0.031] as an independent risk factor for worse OS.Conclusion: Low baseline serum sodium was an independent risk factor for poor OS in patients treated with ICIs.",1
"PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) targeted therapies may be useful for several cancers. The use of non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic molecular imaging platforms could improve clinical assessment of PD-L1 tumor status during these therapies. Contrast enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging (CE-USMI) techniques may offer versatile and cost-effective ways to detect and quantify the expression levels of cellular targets in vivo. However, conventional use of microbubbles as a blood pool contrast agent for CE-USMI is limited to accessing intravascular biomarkers rather than reflecting the tumor molecular status. Using a microfluidic based reconstruction process we therefore developed ultra-stable nanobubbles (NBs) as a contrast agent for molecular imaging of vascular and extravascular cell surface markers. We then functionalized these NBs by covalently linking to nanobody (FN3hPD-L1) targeting human (h)PD-L1 to measure the expression of human PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo. We showed the specific binding of hPD-L1 targeted NBs in cell culture, and in xenografted mouse models of hPD-L1 expressing CT26 tumors. CE-USMI of hPD-L1 in the TME in vivo showed ~3-fold increase in contrast signal compared to non-targeted NBs. Overall, in vivo use of CE-USMI with hPD-L1 targeted NBs has the potential for clinical translation and imaging of human cancers during immunotherapy, and for prognostic evaluation of patient response to PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy.","BackgroundThe CD-TK double suicide gene has become an effective therapy for bladder cancer. A novel molecular-targeted ultrasound (US) method has been developed to precisely guide nanobubbles loaded with this gene to regions within bladder tumor cells and is widely used due to its efficiency in delivering drugs to the target tumor.MethodsUniform nanoscaled nanobubbles loaded with CD-TK double suicide gene were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods.ResultsIn the present study, we synthesized CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded cationic nanobubbles conjugated with anti-VEGFR2 that can bind with VEGFR2-positive cells. Fluorescence and flow cytometry evidence show that CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded nanobubbles were successfully developed. CD-TK-CNBs delivered via US-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) enhanced transfection efficiency, overexpression of CD-TK double suicide gene, and tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro.ConclusionsThese CD-TK-CNBs may become a novel treatment for bladder cancer.",1
"Currently, cancer immunotherapy efficacy is measured by endpoints, such as progression-free survival and overall survival, that are unable to reflect authentic responses to checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials. Second progression-free survival, however, could be an ideal surrogate endpoint due to its easy measurability, correlation with overall survival, and ability to evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapies. This commentary summarizes second progression-free survival data from clinical trials investigating first-line anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors. We speculate that first-line immunotherapies exert a positive influence on the efficacy of later therapies in patients with a few cancer types, though additional research is urgently warranted.","AbstractBACKGROUNDGlioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults with a poor survival and an unmet need for more effective therapies. Macroscopically, as observed through MR imaging and microscopy, these tumors are characterized by distinct tumor regions: a contrast-enhancing tumor core with a high cancer cell density and an infiltration zone that appears T2/FLAIR hyperintense without the uptake of contrast agent and consists of infiltrating tumor cells as well as non-malignant cells of the microenvironment. Previous genomic and transcriptomic studies revealed molecular differences between the tumor core and the infiltration zone. However, functional differences, such as drug sensitivity, between tumor regions are still largely unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODSTo address this gap, we collected region-specific glioblastoma patient tissue samples from both the contrast-enhancing tumor core and the non-contrast-enhanced but 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescent infiltration zone directly from surgery. We utilized pharmacoscopy, a microscopy-based single-cell drug screening approach, to identify drug responses across regions and patients. RESULTSBy profiling a library of 60 drugs across regions in a cohort of 23 patients, we identified region-specific drug responses and developed a complementarity score to pinpoint drug combinations capable of targeting both the tumor core and the infiltration zone. These combination treatments exhibited highly promising anti-tumor activity across regions and patients. CONCLUSIONGiven the high levels of functional spatial intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, relying on a single drug across patients may not be feasible for effective patient treatment. Thus, there is a strong rationale to administer drug combinations that not only consider regional heterogeneity but also account for patient-specific variations.",0
"Blockade of the TGFβ signaling pathway has emerged from preclinical studies as a potential treatment to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and several other types of cancer. However, clinical translation of first-generation inhibitors has shown little success. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of HYL001, a potent inhibitor of TGFβ receptor 1 (ALK5), that is approximately 9 times more efficacious than the structurally related compound galunisertib, while maintaining a favorable safety profile. HYL001 in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1) eradicates liver metastases generated in mice by microsatellite stable, aggressive colorectal cancer tumors at doses where galunisertib is ineffective.","PurposeThe expression of cytochrome B561 (CYB561) and its role in breast cancer (BC) prognosis remain unclear. We analyzed the differential expression and prognostic value of CYB561 using online databases and a clinical cohort through bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry.MethodsThe differential expression of CYB561 and its association with BC were analyzed using the tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER), gene expression profiling interaction analysis2 (GEPIA2), Human Protein Atlas, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and Kaplan–Meier Plotter website. Important pathways of CYB561 enrichment were explored using gene set enrichment analysis. Immunohistochemistry detected CYB561 expression in normal breast, breast hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), para-cancer, and invasive BC groups. Association between CYB561 expression and BC prognosis was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses.ResultsCYB561 mRNA expression was higher in GEPIA and TIMER BC patients than in para-cancer tissues. CYB561 was expressed in the glandular epithelium and myoepithelium, with positive localization in the cytoplasm and cell membrane. CYB561 protein expression significantly differed among the groups. CYB561 expression was correlated with ERBB2/HER2 and infiltrating CD4+ T cells in GEPIA and TIMER BC patients and associated with HER2 status, histological grade, and molecular subtypes in the clinical cohort but not related to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. CYB561 mRNA overexpression predicted reduced recurrence-free survival and overall survival in BC. Patients with CYB561 expression had significantly reduced overall survival and increased risk of death.ConclusionCYB561 can serve as an effective clinical prognostic biomarker for BC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03928-z.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundPoly (β-amino Ester) nanocarriers show promise for gene therapy, but their effectiveness can be limited by the environment within the body. This study aims to understand how common cell culture media components affect optimized PBAE nanocarrier performance in gene delivery.MethodsOptimized PBAE was synthesized based on Michael addition reaction and characterized by different assays, this study employed techniques like DLS and TEM to characterize PBAE nanocarriers, followed by cellular uptake analysis (flow cytometry and confocal imaging) and evaluation of gene expression under different polymer/DNA ratio ratios and media conditions.ResultsThe nanocarriers exhibited size under 200 nm and surface positive charge, with high encapsulation efficiency (up to 95%). Cellular uptake, transfection efficiency, and cytotoxicity were evaluated. Flow cytometry analysis revealed high cellular uptake (over 77% at 1 hour and up to 95% after 3 hours) and good viability. Transfection efficiency reached up to 80% with 2 μg DNA, particularly at weight ratios of 60 and 90.ConclusionThe study also identified factors affecting transfection efficiency, including serum concentration and antibiotics in the culture medium, highlighting the importance of optimizing these conditions for future applications.","Aim: To investigate DNA methylation levels of a panel of genes in thymic epithelial tumors (TETs).Materials & methods: We selected 15 genes among the most promising epigenetic biomarkers of TETs and evaluated their methylation levels in 71 TET samples.Results: thymic carcinomas (TCs) showed hypermethylation of GHSR and ELF3 genes and reduced IL1RN methylation levels compared with thymomas (TMs) and healthy thymic tissues. RAG1 was hypomethylated in TMs compared with healthy thymic tissues. No difference in the methylation levels of the investigated genes was seen among TM stages and subtypes. No changes in blood methylation levels of the investigated genes were seen among TET subtypes.Conclusion: The present study confirms GHSR, ELF3, IL1RN and RAG1 as TET epigenetic biomarkers.",0
"Adverse effects of immunotherapeutic treatments like atezolizumab remain largely unknown due to limited experience. We present a 65-year-old man with sudden dyspnea and other symptoms, implicating immunotherapy. Prompt intervention and suspension were crucial. This study identifies a novel unreported adverse effect—bilateral vocal cord and velopalatine paralysis—associated with atezolizumab use.","IntroductionThe study aimed to explore the underlying immunologic mechanisms and immune-related biomarkers associated with alopecia areata (AA) development.Material and methodsExpression data from the GSE68801 dataset, concerning 60 individuals with alopecia areata (28 patchy-type AA (AAP), 23 alopecia universalis (AU), 9 alopecia totalis (AT)), and 36 normal controls (NC), were analyzed. The study investigated differentially expressed RNAs (DERs), immune infiltration, and immune-related modules. Functional enrichment analysis of overlapping DERs was conducted using DAVID. Additionally, overlapping pathways and genes identified in a co-expression network, along with data from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database 2019 update, were screened.ResultsIn total, 1708 lncRNAs and 17,326 mRNAs, along with 427 overlapping DERs among AAP, AU, AT, and NC, were identified. Subsequently, 17 biological processes significantly associated with inflammatory and immune responses, as well as 8 KEGG signaling pathways, including the chemokine and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, were enriched. Notable differences in the infiltration of four T cell subtypes – activated CD8 T cells, effector memory CD8 T cells, regulatory T cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells – were observed compared to NC. Two modules were found to be significantly linked to disease stage progression and various T cell types. Functional analysis revealed significant enrichment of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and the T cell receptor signaling pathway among the genes involved in these modules. Furthermore, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were identified as key nodes associated with the disease.ConclusionsOur study revealed that AA is an autoimmune disease associated with T cells, with CXCL9 and CXCL10 emerging as significant prognostic factors in its development.",0
"Lung cancer treatment is evolving, and the role of senescent macrophages in tumor immune evasion has become a key focus. This study explores how senescent macrophages interact with lung cancer cells, contributing to tumor progression and immune dysfunction. As aging impairs macrophage functions, including phagocytosis and metabolic signaling, it promotes chronic inflammation and cancer development. p16INK4a-positive macrophages are common in aged mice, and their clearance slows tumor growth, suggesting these cells support tumor proliferation and immune evasion. Targeting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and reprogramming senescent macrophages offers potential therapeutic benefits, including reversing immune aging and boosting anti-tumor immunity. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires further molecular understanding and rigorous clinical trials.","PurposeLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for approximately half of patients in lung cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major component in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeting CAFs is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, therapeutic targets of CAFs in LUAD remains largely unclear.MethodsSeven CAFs and nine normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from tumor and paratumor tissues of LUAD patients undergoing surgery, respectively. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis were performed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their functions in CAFs compared with NFs. DEGs of ten overlaying were obtained from RNA-seq, our previously reported lncRNA microarray and public datasets (E-MTAB-6149, E-MTAB-6653) and validated by RT-qPCR. Nik-related kinase (NRK) was further validated by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence (IF), Western Blot (WB) in vitro, and in Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database. Survival analysis was performed on Kaplan–Meier plotter.ResultsA total of 1799 DEGs were identified, including 650 upregulated DEGs and 1149 downregulated DEGs. The upregulated and downregulated DEGs were mostly enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM) functions and in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways. Interestingly, NRK was the most significantly upregulated overlaying DEGs which was rarely associated with CAFs before. NRK was predominantly expressed in CAFs, but weakly expressed in NFs, normal lung bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, LUAD cell lines A549 and H1299, as well as in the majority of 191 lung cancer cell lines including LUAD. Moreover, elevated NRK predicted poor survival in LUAD patients.ConclusionHere, we first report that NRK is significantly elevated in LUAD-associated CAFs and may function as a promising therapeutic target for cancer combination treatment. Besides, modulation of ECM and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways may be an efficient approach to alter CAFs functionality in LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-020-03489-z.",1
"To more accurately diagnose and treat patients with different subtypes of thyroid cancer, we constructed a diagnostic model related to the iodine metabolism of THCA subtypes. THCA expression profiles, corresponding clinicopathological information, and single-cell RNA-seq were downloaded from TCGA and GEO databases. Genes related to thyroid differentiation score were obtained by GSVA. Through logistic analyses, the diagnostic model was finally constructed. DCA curve, ROC curve, machine learning, and K-M analysis were used to verify the accuracy of the model. qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression of hub genes in vitro. There were 104 crossover genes between different TDS and THCA subtypes. Finally, 5 genes (ABAT, CHEK1, GPX3, NME5, and PRKCQ) that could independently predict the TDS subpopulation were obtained, and a diagnostic model was constructed. ROC, DCA, and RCS curves exhibited that the model has accurate prediction ability. K-M and subgroup analysis results showed that low model scores were strongly associated with poor PFI in THCA patients. The model score was significantly negatively correlated with T cell follicular helper. In addition, the diagnostic model was significantly negatively correlated with immune scores. Finally, the results of qRT-PCR corresponded with bioinformatics results. This diagnostic model has good diagnostic and prognostic value for THCA patients, and can be used as an independent prognostic indicator for THCA patients.","Graphical abstractA working model to illustrate the dual nature of type I IFN responses and feedback regulations by SOCS1 dictate malaria mortality. Differential dynamics of TFs (NF-κB, MAPK, and type I IFN signaling pathways) and SOCS1 synergistically determine the distinct production of type I IFN during 17XL and PbANKA infections. 17XL infection induces an early spike of TFs and weak SOCS1 response that does not trigger I1-FFL, leading to early IFN-α/β production. SOCS1 production in late infection shuts down type I IFN response by a strong negative feedback loop. The early IFN-α/β responses induced by TLR7-IRF7 signaling enhance anti-malarial immunity through expanding CD11ahiCD49dhiCD4+ T cells. In contrary, PbANKA infection triggers early strong SOCS1 expression to activate I1-FFL on type I IFN production and delays TFs response, leading to a late IFN-α/β production. Late IFN-α/β responses induced by both TLR9-IRF7 and STING-IRF3 mediated signaling impede host immunity through inhibiting malaria antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and inducing PD-1+CD8+ cells during PbANKA infection.",0
"BackgroundColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, which imposes a significant societal burden. Regular screening and emerging molecular tumor markers have important implications for detecting the progression and development of colorectal cancer. Disulfidptosis is a newly defined type of programmed cell death triggered by abnormal accumulation of disulfide compounds in cells that stimulate disulfide stress. Currently, there is no relevant discussion on this mechanism and colorectal cancer.MethodsWe classified the disulfidptosis-related subtypes of colorectal cancer using bioinformatics methods. Through secondary clustering of differentially expressed genes between subtypes, we identified characteristic genes of the disulfidptosis subtype, constructed a prognostic model, and searched for potential biomarkers through clinical validation.ResultsUsing disulfidptosis-related genes collected from the literature, we classified colorectal cancer patients from public databases into three subtypes. The differentially expressed genes between subtypes were clustered into three gene subtypes, and eight characteristic genes were screened to construct a prognostic model.ConclusionThe disulfidptosis mechanism has important value in the classification of colorectal cancer patients, and characteristic genes selected based on this mechanism can serve as a new potential biological marker for colorectal cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05211-1.","BackgroundRecent studies have shown that lysosomes not only provide energy for tumor cell growth, but also participate in the occurrence and development of malignant tumors by regulating various ways of tumor cell death. However, the role of lysosome associated genes (LSAGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.MethodsTranscriptome data and clinical data of HCC were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases. We identified differential expression of LSAGs by comparing tumor tissue with normal liver tissue. Subsequently, we used univariate COX analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) COX regression to construct the prognostic feature of LSAGs. Kaplan–Meier survival curve and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to evaluate the predictive ability of LSAGs feature. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used for functional enrichment analysis of risk differential genes. The relationship between LSAGs score and tumor microenvironment and chemotherapy drug sensitivity was analyzed. Finally, the cellular communication of tumor cells with high and low expression of model LSAGs was explored.ResultsWe identified sixteen prognostic associated LSAGs, four of which were selected to construct prognostic feature of LSAGs. Patients in the low LSAGs group had a better prognosis than those in the high LSAGs group. GO and KEGG analyses showed that risk differential genes were enriched in leukocyte migration, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The group with low LSAGs score had lower immune score. Patients in the high LSAGs group were more sensitive to drugs for chemotherapy. In addition, tumor cells with high expression of model LSAGs showed stronger association with immune cells through the interleukin-2 (IL2), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), adiponectin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signaling pathways.ConclusionWe established a LSAGs signature that had the ability to predict clinical prognosis and immune landscape, proposing potential therapeutic targets for HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05477-5.",1
"BackgroundBacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is capable of enhancing the infiltration of immune cells into the tumour. However the temporal dynamics of immune cell patterns in patients receiving BCG instillation remains unclear.MethodsNinety-six patients who underwent intravesical BCG therapy, comprising 46 responders and 50 non-responders, were retrospectively enroled to explore the evolving immune landscape. This study involved a detailed examination of sequential samples collected before, during, and after BCG treatment to assess BCG’s influence on the immune microenvironment, employing techniques such as immunohistochemistry, fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry, and mass spectrometry techniques.ResultsOur study found that initial BCG instillation leads to enhanced immune cell infiltration, correlating with treatment efficacy, with responders exhibiting more pronounced increases. Non-responders experience a rise in immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression during the first instillation, which returns to baseline after treatment. In non-responders, BCG re-challenge fail to further increase immune cell infiltration into the tumour or improve patient outcomes. Strikingly, proteomics data revealed that GBP1 expression was induced by BCG treatment in non-responders.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrated the induction of tumour PD-L1 expression by BCG in non-responders, and therefore provide insights for the combination of BCG and anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy.","There is a lack of effective treatments to overcome resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutant tumors. A deeper understanding of resistance mechanisms can provide insights into reducing or eliminating resistance, and can potentially deliver targeted treatment measures to overcome resistance. Here, we identified that the dynamic changes of the tumor immune environment were important extrinsic factors driving tumor resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR mutant cell lines and syngeneic tumor-bearing mice. Our results demonstrate that the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs is accompanied by aberrant expression of PD-L2, leading a dynamic shift from an initially favorable tumor immune environment to an immunosuppressive phenotype. PD-L2 expression significantly affected EGFR mutant cell apoptosis that depended on the proportion and function of CD8+ T cells in the tumor immune environment. Combined with single-cell sequencing and experimental results, we demonstrated that PD-L2 specifically inhibited the proliferation of CD8+ T cells and the secretion of granzyme B and perforin, leading to reduced apoptosis mediated by CD8+ T cells and enhanced immune escape of tumor cells, which drives EGFR-TKIs resistance. Importantly, we have identified a potent natural small-molecule inhibitor of PD-L2, zinc undecylenate. In vitro, it selectively and potently blocks the PD-L2/PD-1 interaction. In vivo, it abolishes the suppressive effect of the PD-L2-overexpressing tumor immune microenvironment by blocking PD-L2/PD-1 signaling. Moreover, the combination of zinc undecylenate and EGFR-TKIs can synergistically reverse tumor resistance, which is dependent on CD8+ T cells mediating apoptosis. Our study uncovers the PD-L2/PD-1 signaling pathway as a driving factor to mediate EGFR-TKIs resistance, and identifies a new naturally-derived agent to reverse EGFR-TKIs resistance.",1
"Breast cancer has a high incidence and high heterogeneity among women worldwide, but its lack of highly consistent in vitro research models has limited the translation of experimental results into clinical applications. The emergence of tumor organoids in the new era has aroused great interest among scientists. Organoids possess multi-omics characteristics highly preserved from parental tumors and offer advantages such as long-term and stable passaging and visualization in vitro. Thus, they have overcome multiple defects of two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). However, the lack of inter-organoid homogeneity, vascular-like fluid system and complex microenvironment has affected their wider applications, making it urgent to introduce new approaches for developing a more comprehensive functionality of this model. In recent years, the combination of tumor organoids with other innovative technologies has provided some relevantly important solutions and made it an optimal high-throughput and high-fidelity in vitro model. Here, we provide an overview of the development and optimization of breast cancer organoids, discuss how they have been integrated with several emerging technologies, and further summarize their applications in functional precision oncology. We believe that the intersection of new technologies has great potential in breast cancer translational research, which may finally provide new insights into organoid-guided breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment.","Traditionally, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was considered a radioresistant tumor, thereby limiting definitive radiation therapy management options. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can achieve high rates of local control for the treatment of primary RCC. In the setting of an expanding use of SBRT for primary RCC, it is crucial to provide guidance on practical considerations such as patient selection, fractionation, target delineation, and response assessment. This is particularly important in challenging scenarios where a paucity of evidence exists, such as in patients with a solitary kidney, bulky tumors, or tumor thrombus. The Radiosurgery Society endorses this case-based guide to provide a practical framework for delivering SBRT to primary RCC, exemplified by three cases. This article explores topics of tumor size and dose fractionation, impact on renal function and treatment in the setting of a solitary kidney, and radiation’s role in the management of inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. Additionally, we review existing evidence and expert opinion on target delineation, advanced techniques like MRI-guided SBRT, and SBRT response assessment.",0
"PurposeThis study aimed to explore the clinical implications of ctDNA for epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) as the first-line treatment in EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in real-world settings.MethodsA total of 122 patients with NSCLC who underwent tissue and liquid next generation sequencing (NGS) tests were included. 66 patients with detected EGFR mutation in both tumor-tissue and plasma were included into the EGFRt+, p+ group, and 56 patients with EGFR mutation detected only in tumor-tissue were included into the EGFRt+, p− group. The differences in clinical characteristics, concomitant mutations and prognosis between the two groups were compared.ResultsThe detection rate of the EGFRt+, p+ group was 54.1% (66/122). EGFRt+, p+ in the NGS test was particularly relevant to the size of tumors, liver metastasis, bone metastasis and TP53 mutation. In patients with TP53 mutation in ctDNA, the detection rate of EGFR mutation in ctDNA was up to 91.3%. EGFRt+, p+ could be an independent prognostic factor for first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment. Combination therapy seems to be a promising approach to improve the outcome for EGFRt+, p+ (P = 0.017, HR 0.509 [95% CI 0.288–0.897]). Moreover, the combination of TP53 mutated status and EGFRm status in plasma showed a better completion of risk stratification for PFS (Log-rank P < 0.001).ConclusionsCo-detection of EGFR mutation in tumor tissue and plasma is an independent prognostic factor for first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment. Moreover, combination therapy could be a promising approach to improve the outcome for these patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03952-z.","BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promising results in treating blood cancers, but it has limited efficacy against solid tumors that express mesothelin (MSLN). One of the reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which consists of physical barriers, multiple mechanisms of immune evasion, and various biochemical factors that favor tumor growth and survival. These factors reduce the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells in clinical trials. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to enhance the effectiveness of MSLN-targeted CAR T cell therapy.MethodsTo investigate whether the antitumor efficacy of anti-MSLN CAR-T cells depends on the epitopes they recognize, we generated MSLN-targeted CAR T cells that bind to different regions of MSLN (Region I, II, III and Full length). We then evaluated the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan or an anti-PD-1 antibody in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe found that MSLN-targeted CAR T cells effectively killed MSLN-positive cancer cells (H9, H226 and Panc-1), but not MSLN-negative cells (A431) in vitro. In a mouse model of H9 tumor xenografts, all CAR T cells showed similar tumor suppression, but an MSLN-targeted scFv with Region I epitope, R47, performed slightly better. Combining irinotecan with CAR_R47 T cells enhanced tumor control synergistically in both H9 xenograft mice and patient-derived xenograft mice.ConclusionsOur results suggest that irinotecan can enhance the antitumor activity of MSLN-targeted CAR T cells, and offer a promising combination therapy strategy for MSLN-positive solid tumors.",1
"PurposePeritoneal metastasis in gastric cancer (GC) is a late-stage condition with a poor prognosis. Cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a popular treatment for peritoneal metastases. Here, we aim to investigate the real-world application and efficacy of HIPEC alone for GC patients with synchronous peritoneal metastases.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis on GC patients with synchronous peritoneal metastasis at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between January 2011 and December 2022. Survival analyses and Cox regression models were performed based on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), and subgroup analysis was used to determine the prognostic value of HIPEC across different treatment.ResultsWe enrolled 250 patients, of whom 120 (48%) received HIPEC while 130 (52%) did not. HIPEC showed no survival benefit for GC patients (P = 0.220 for OS and P = 0.370 for CSS). However, subgroup analysis found that HIPEC can only improve OS and CSS when combined with primary tumor resection (P = 0.034 for OS and P = 0.036 for CSS). Moreover, survival analyses also demonstrated that HIPEC independently improved OS (HR for OS = 0.58, 95% CI 0.37–0.92, P = 0.020) and CSS (HR for CSS = 0.58, 95% CI 0.37–0.93, P = 0.024) for patients who underwent primary site resection, but not for those who did not.ConclusionHIPEC can improve survival in GC patients with synchronous peritoneal metastases who have primary tumor resection, but not in those without primary tumor resection.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05481-9.","ResumenEl cáncer de colon es una de las neoplasias malignas más comunes en el mundo, caracterizada por un crecimiento descontrolado de las células de la mucosa del colon, cuyo tratamiento depende de las características propias del tumor tales como su localización, tamaño, extensión de metástasis y el estado de salud del paciente. La nanomedicina se muestra como una nueva estrategia para superar las limitaciones de las terapias actuales ya que debido al tamaño nanométrico de los materiales empleados, estos pueden ignorar los mecanismos asociados a la resistencia multifármaco. Las nanocorazas de oro poseen la capacidad de absorber luz infrarroja cercana y convertirla en energía térmica para producir hipertermia en tumores in vivo. Esto se lleva a cabo mediante la metodología de hipertermia asistida por nanopartículas, la cual consiste en realizar irradiación a las nanopartículas con una fuente de energía externa que produzca calor entre los 39 - 45 °C, lo que genera un calentamiento controlado, dirigido y específico contra el tumor sin dañar el tejido sano circundante. En comparación con otros nanomateriales, las nanocorazas de oro presentan alta biocompatibilidad y baja citotoxicidad. Por lo que, la terapia en combinación con quimioterapéuticos más hipertermia sobre nanocorazas de oro, se presenta como un enfoque novedoso y prometedor para el tratamiento del cáncer de colon.",0
"AbstractBackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies targeting glioblastoma (GBM)-associated antigens such as interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL-13Rα2) have achieved limited clinical efficacy to date, in part due to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by inhibitory molecules such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). The aim of this study was to engineer more potent GBM-targeting CAR-T cells by countering TGF-β-mediated immune suppression in the TME.MethodsWe engineered a single-chain, bispecific CAR targeting IL-13Rα2 and TGF-β, which programs tumor-specific T cells to convert TGF-β from an immunosuppressant to an immunostimulant. Bispecific IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells were evaluated for efficacy and safety against both patient-derived GBM xenografts and syngeneic models of murine glioma.ResultsTreatment with IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells leads to greater T-cell infiltration and reduced suppressive myeloid cell presence in the tumor-bearing brain compared to treatment with conventional IL-13Rα2 CAR-T cells, resulting in improved survival in both patient-derived GBM xenografts and syngeneic models of murine glioma.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that by reprogramming tumor-specific T-cell responses to TGF-β, bispecific IL-13Rα2/TGF-β CAR-T cells resist and remodel the immunosuppressive TME to drive potent anti-tumor responses in GBM.","PurposeThis study aims to elucidate the mechanism underlying temozolomide resistance in patients with MGMT promoter hypomethylated glioblastoma, which is correlated with poor prognosis. The objective is to identify therapeutic targets and drugs suitable for temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma patients using big data analysis.MethodsIn this retrospective study, transcriptome sequencing data from 457 glioblastoma patients, multi-omics data, and single-cell sequencing data were employed to assess the expression pattern, prognostic value, and biological functions of AHR in glioblastoma. The HERB database was utilized to screen for AHR-targeted drugs for glioblastoma treatment. Validation of our findings was conducted using multiplex immunofluorescence staining of clinical samples and T cells and tumor cells co-culture models.ResultsOur findings demonstrated that patients with MGMT promoter unmethylation did not benefit from postoperative temozolomide chemotherapy due to resistance arising from DNA repair function and tumor immune response. AHR was found to be expressed in immune cells and exhibited an immunomodulatory role in glioblastoma with MGMT promoter unmethylation. AHR was identified as a potential novel inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor, serving as a therapeutic target for temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma. Furthermore, targeting AHR with Semen aesculi markedly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of T cells on glioma cells.ConclusionsIn addition to DNA repair function, the tumor immune response plays a pivotal role in temozolomide resistance of glioblastoma. Herbal compounds targeting AHR may offer an effective treatment for temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04894-w.",0
"Abstract This study provides an analysis of 37 ovarian Sertoli–Leydig cell tumors (SLCT), focusing on their morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features. The cohort was comprised of 9 well-differentiated, 25 moderately differentiated, and 3 poorly differentiated tumors. The immunohistochemical analysis was performed with 28 markers, including diagnostic markers and markers with possible predictive significance. The results showed high expression of sex cord markers (FOXL2, SF1, inhibin A, CD99, calretinin, ER, PR, AR), and variable expression of other markers such as CKAE1/3 (83%), CAIX (14%), and MUC4 (1%). Loss of PTEN expression was present in 14% of cases, and CTLA4 expression was seen in 43% of cases. All tumors were MMR proficient and HER2 and PD-L1 negative. The molecular analysis showed DICER1 mutations in 54.5% of cases, and a FOXL2 mutation in 6% of tumors. In addition, we detected 2 cases with TERT promoter mutation. RNA NGS sequencing identified significant differences in mRNA expression between DICER1MUT and DICER1WT tumors. The DICER1WT tumors showed increased expression of PRKCA, HNF1A, LDLR, and MAP2K5. On the contrary, the DICER1MUT cases showed increased expression of CDK6, NOTCH2, and FGFR2. The results of our study show that SLCTs exhibit distinct molecular features based on their degree of differentiation. We have confirmed that DICER1 mutations are characteristic of moderately and poorly differentiated SLCTs, while well-differentiated SLCTs may represent a distinct entity. DICER1MUT and DICER1WT tumors showed different mRNA expression profiles. The FOXL2 mutation is less common in these tumors and is mutually exclusive with the DICER1 mutation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00428-024-03984-5.","Introduction: Colorectal cancer is the second most deadly cancer worldwide. Current screening methods have low detection rates and frequently provide false positive results, leading to missed diagnoses or unnecessary colonoscopies. To tackle this issue, the Wageningen UR iGEM team from 2022 developed “Colourectal”, a living diagnostic tool for colorectal cancer. Following a synthetic biology approach, the project used an engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 strain capable of binding to tumour cells that detects two distinct cancer biomarkers, and secretes a coloured protein observable in stool. Due to the utilization of genetically modified bacteria in vivo, precautionary biosafety measures were included within a three level safe-by-design strategy. Results: The first genetic safeguard ensured confinement of the living diagnostic to the colon environment by implementing auxotrophy to mucin that is abundant in the colon lining. For this, a synthetic chimeric receptor was generated to ensure expression of essential genes in the presence of mucin. The second strategy limited the viability of the engineered bacteria to the human body, preventing proliferation in open environments. The use of a temperature sensitive kill switch induced bacterial cell death at temperatures below 37°C. The third biocontainment strategy was installed as an emergency kill switch to stop the Colourectal test at any point. By inducing a highly genotoxic response through CRISPR-Cas-mediated DNA degradation, cell death of E. coli Nissle is triggered. Discussion: While the use of engineered microorganisms in human applications is not yet a reality, the safety considerations of our multi-layered strategy provide a framework for the development of future living diagnostic tools.",0
"ABSTRACTCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique class of covalently closed single-stranded RNA molecules that play diverse roles in normal physiology and pathology. Among the major types of circRNA, exon-intron circRNA (EIciRNA) distinguishes itself by its sequence composition and nuclear localization. Recent RNA-seq technologies and computational methods have facilitated the detection and characterization of EIciRNAs, with features like circRNA intron retention (CIR) and tissue-specificity being characterized. EIciRNAs have been identified to exert their functions via mechanisms such as regulating gene transcription, and the physiological relevance of EIciRNAs has been reported. Within this review, we present a summary of the current understanding of EIciRNAs, delving into their identification and molecular functions. Additionally, we emphasize factors regulating EIciRNA biogenesis and the physiological roles of EIciRNAs based on recent research. We also discuss the future challenges in EIciRNA exploration, underscoring the potential for novel functions and functional mechanisms of EIciRNAs for further investigation.","No studies have examined the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and HPV-18 on survival, inflammation biomarkers, and immune function in early-stage cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery. Patients diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer were screened for high-risk HPV prior to surgery. The influence of HPV infection on survival, inflammatory markers, and immune function was investigated. Findings revealed that patients in the HPV-18 positive subgroup exhibited poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and elevated levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, along with decreased CD4+ T cells compared to patients who tested negative for HPV-18. Notably, early-stage cervical cancer patients with HPV-18 infection experienced worse DFS, heightened inflammatory markers, and compromised immune function.",0
"AbstractType-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complicated long-term disorder associated with metabolism that is identified by insulin resistance, imbalance in glucose regulation and reduced secretion of insulin. GLP-1(Glucagon-like peptide-1) is an incretin mimetic that has excellent effects on the regulation of blood glucose levels and also the management of disorders associated with vital organs. GLP-1 agonist is an effective class of drug for the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus and associated complications. Liraglutide is one of the potent drugs of this class having similar effects as biological GLP-1. This review includes clinical trials and patents related to the pharmaceutical formulation, synthesis and biological action of liraglutide.","AbstractOBJECTIVEThis study aimed to determine how IDO and subject age impact the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites during immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM). METHODSSerum and colon contents were collected from young 16-20- or older adult 92-118-week-old wild-type (WT; C57BL/6), IDO knockout (IDOKO), and IDO enzyme null (H350A) mice analyzed for 16S rRNA gut microbiome composition and microbial-derived aromatic amino acid metabolites via LC/MS/MS. Fecal samples from young 7-8 or older adult 81-85 week-old WT mice with intracranial GL261 brain tumors treated with or without brain radiation (RT) and PD-1 mAb were also analyzed. RESULTSYoung and old IDOKO and H350A mice demonstrated a unique gut microbiome signature with an elevated abundance of Bifidobacterium and Helicobacter (p<0.05) and a reduced abundance of Ventriosum and Sireaum compared to WT mice (p<0.001). Prevotellaceae, Muribaculum, Alistipes, Enterohabdus, Clostridia, and Akkermansia were different in IDOKO and H350A mice compared to WT - but only in old mice. Serum aryl-lactates including phenyllactate, indolelacatate, and 4-hydroxyphenyllactate were increased in IDOKO mice compared to WT and H350A mice (p<0.001) – again, only in old mice. Older adult WT mice with GL261 showed lower fecal aryl-lactates compared to younger counterparts. Treatment with RT + PD-1 mAb decreased phenyllactate levels in old but not young mice with GL261 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONSThere are IDO enzyme- and non-enzyme-dependent effects on gut microbiota composition and bioactive microbial aromatic amino acid metabolites. These data warrant further investigation into how microbial metabolism affects immunotherapy efficacy and brain tumor survival across the lifespan.",0
"PurposeThere is uncertainty regarding the role of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).MethodsWe identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICIs combined with NACT to NACT in early-stage TNBC. Efficacy outcomes included pathological complete response (pCR) and event-free survival (EFS). Toxicity data included any grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, AEs leading to death, common and meaningful AEs associated with chemotherapy and immune-related AEs. Odds ratio (ORs), hazard ratios (HR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) for efficacy and toxicity were extracted and pooled in a meta-analysis. Differences in the odds for pCR between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status and between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors were also assessed.ResultsFive RCTs comprising 2,075 patients were analyzed. Compared to NACT alone, combination of ICIs and NACT significantly improved pCR (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25–2.47, p = 0.001) and EFS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48–0.91, p = 0.01). Magnitude of effect on pCR was similar between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors (p for the subgroup difference = 0.80) and between PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibitors (p = 0.27). The combination treatment resulted in higher odds of any grade 3/4 AEs (OR 1.31, p = 0.02) and serious AEs (OR 1.84, p = 0.006), with no statistically significant difference in AEs leading to death (OR 1.67, p = 0.51). Higher magnitude of toxicity was observed for immune-related AEs.ConclusionCombination of ICIs and NACT were associated with improved outcome in early-stage TNBC while increasing toxicity significantly. Longer follow-up is desired to better understand the risk and benefit ratio of this combination.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03591-w.","AbstractBACKGROUNDImmunotherapy (IT) has gained increased significance as a systemic therapy option in the management of various types of metastatic cancer, including cases involving brain metastases (BMs). The differential diagnosis of progressive/relapsed BMs and treatment-related changes (TRC) is often based on imaging with amino acid (AA) PET, in addition to standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as this has been established to provide higher diagnostic accuracy. However, diagnostic value of the AA-PET in the context of IT has not been studied so far. In this pilot study we quantified diagnostic accuracy of AA PET in patients with suspected progressive BMs under IT. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis retrospective study included patients with suspected progressive/relapsed BMs on MRI after radiotherapy (RT) between 04/2007 - 01/2023. Only patients with AA PET ≤ 4 weeks prior to surgery/biopsy of BMs were selected. AA PET results were compared with histopathological findings and distinctive features were highlighted. RESULTSOut of 29 patients, 7 were treated with IT (IT+ group). Remaining patients (IT- group) were treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, a combination of both, or obtained no systemic therapy before PET. The groups did not differ regarding age, gender, initial number of BMs or time interval between PET and last RT. In the IT+ group, 6 patients had malignant melanoma and 1 patient urothelial carcinoma as primary tumor. The IT+ patients obtained ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab, sequentially, or in combination. In the IT+ and IT- group, 7 and 21 PET scans were read as suspicious for progressive/relapsed BMs, respectively. The rate of false-positive findings was 5/7 (71.4%) and 3/21 (14.3%), respectively (chi square test, p=0.008). Histopathological analyses revealed an inflammatory reaction with lymphocytic infiltrates in the examined tissue in the IT+ group. CONCLUSIONThere is a significantly higher rate of false-positive AA PET findings in patients with BMs who have been treated with IT. This observation may be explained by an immunologically mediated inflammatory reaction. Further immunological analyses of lymphocytic infiltrates could provide more information.In conclusion, until more data are available, caution should be exercised when diagnosing tumor recurrence using AA PET in patients who have previously received IT.",0
"BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC.MethodsWe searched published randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of ICIs combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on SCLC. The extracted data included the number of people who achieved an objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), the hazard ratio (HR) of progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsSix RCTs involving 2477 patients were included. Compared with chemotherapy alone, patients receiving an ICI combined with chemotherapy had a significantly longer PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.88–0.95, p < 0.00001) and OS (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.96, p = 0.0001). The ORR increased, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.12, p = 0.13). There was no significant difference in the DCR between the two treatment regimens; however, in patients treated with an ICI, fatigue, rashes, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferase enzymes were significantly increased (p < 0.05).ConclusionICI combined with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to PFS and OS in patients with advanced SCLC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03362-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","AimThe aim of this study was to construct and validate a nomogram to predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) in external ear melanoma (EEM) patients in the elderly based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.MethodsThe information of patients diagnosed with EEM in the elderly between 2010 and 2014 was downloaded from the SEER database. Univariable and multivariable Cox analyses were carried out to identify the independent characteristics, and the independent factors were further included to construct a nomogram. The discriminative ability and calibration of the nomogram to predict OS were tested using C-index value, and calibration plots. Based on the risk score of the nomogram, the patients were divided into high- and low-risk subgroup. Finally, the survival differences of different subgroups were explored by Kaplan–Meier curves. All statistical analyses were performed by R 4.2.0.ResultsA total of 710 elderly EMM patients were included and randomly divided into training cohort and validation cohort. Univariable Cox regression were used to identify age, race, sex, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), T, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tumor size as independent risk factors. Then, multivariable Cox model to determine significant risk factors was used to establish the selected factors. A nomogram for predicting the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was constructed using the independent variables including age, AJCC, T, surgery and chemotherapy. The C-index values were 0.78 (95% CI 0.75–0.81) in training set and 0.72 (95% CI 0.66–0.78) in validation set. The calibration curves were closer to ideal curves indicated the accurate predictive ability of this nomogram. The elderly patients with EEM in the low-risk group showed a longer OS than patients in the high-risk group in both training and validation cohorts.ConclusionsOur study established and validated a novel model to predict 1-, 3- and 5-year OS for EEM. The individualized nomogram has a good prognostic ability and can be used as a new survival prediction tool for the elderly patients with EMM.",1
"PurposeItraconazole is an antifungal drug that has been clinically used for over 30 years. In recent years, scholars have discovered that it possesses an anticancer effect. Moreover, its mechanism has been clarified to some degree. What deserves to be mentioned is that itraconazole acting on the Hedgehog pathway has made a new progress in the treatment of cancers. While interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the Hedgehog pathway is largely activated in different cancer cells.ResultThis review tries to highlight the effect of itraconazole on smoothened receptor (SMO) in the Hedgehog pathway, thereby reducing the glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) release and finally exhibiting a range of anticancer effects, promoting apoptosis of cancer cells, and inhibiting proliferation by indirect inhibition of NF-κB pathway and inflammation, moreover, promoting the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, inhibiting the expression of target genes transcribed by GLI such as BCL-2 and Cyclin-D1. Besides, itraconazole increases the number of Bnip3, subsequently, inducing the dissociation of the Beclin-1/BCL-2 binding complex, as a result of ultimately promoting autophagy of cancer cells.ConclusionAs a new anticancer drug, whether itraconazole eventually entering clinical application requires the joint eforts of all scholars. In any case, an in-depth study on itraconazole will bring new hope for cancer patients in the near future.","AbstractBackgroundRecurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG) lacks effective life-prolonging treatments and the efficacy of systemic PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors is limited. The multi-cohort Glitipni phase I trial investigates the safety and feasibility of intraoperative intracerebral (iCer) and postoperative intracavitary (iCav) nivolumab (NIVO) ± ipilimumab (IPI) treatment following maximal safe resection (MSR) in rHGG.Materials and methods Patients received 10 mg IV NIVO within 24 h before surgery, followed by MSR, iCer 5 mg IPI and 10 mg NIVO, and Ommaya catheter placement in the resection cavity. Biweekly postoperative iCav administrations of 1–5–10 mg NIVO (cohort 4) or 10 mg NIVO plus 1–5–10 mg IPI (cohort 7) were combined with 10 mg IV NIVO for 11 cycles.Results42 rHGG patients underwent MSR with iCer NIVO + IPI. 16 pts were treated in cohort 4 (postoperative iCav NIVO at escalating doses) while 28 patients were treated in cohort 7 (intra and postoperative iCav NIVO and escalating doses of IPI). The most common TRAE was fatigue; no grade 5 AE occurred. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 neutrophilic pleocytosis (4 pts) receiving iCav NIVO plus 5 or 10 mg IPI. PFS and OS did not significantly differ between cohorts (median OS: 42 [95% CI 26–57] vs. 35 [29–40] weeks; 1-year OS rate: 37% vs. 29%). Baseline B7–H3 expression significantly correlated with worse survival. OS compared favorably to a historical pooled cohort (n = 469) of Belgian rHGG pts treated with anti-VEGF therapies (log-rank P = .015).ConclusionIntraoperative iCer IPI + NIVO with postoperative iCav NIVO ± IPI up to biweekly doses of 1 mg IPI + 10 mg NIVO is feasible and safe, showing encouraging OS in rHGG patients.

"SummaryPathologists play a central role in RCC patient care by confirming the diagnosis of malignancy, determining the histologic type of RCC, and assessing many important prognostic factors such as the pathological stage, nuclear grade, presence of sarcomatoid or rhabdoid features, and others. In recent years, our increased understanding of the molecular alterations driving specific RCC types has led to an improved classification scheme that better informs patient prognosis and treatment. In spite of this progress, no predictive biomarkers are currently approved for the management of patients with RCC. Pathologists are uniquely positioned to move the field forward by developing IHC/mIF-based predictors of outcome to ICI-based therapy that could be utilized in the clinic.","Over the last decade, cancer diagnostics has undergone a notable transformation with increasing complexity. Minimally invasive diagnostic tests, driven by advanced imaging and early detection protocols, is redefining patient care and reducing the need for more invasive procedures. Modern cytopathologists, beyond their diagnostic role, now safeguard patient samples for vital biomarker and molecular testing. In this article, we explore ancillary testing modalities and the role of biomarkers in organ-specific contexts, underscoring the transformative impact of precision medicine. Finally, the advent of more than 80 FDA-approved predictive biomarkers signals a new era, guiding cancer care toward personalized and targeted strategies.",1
"PurposeRecent studies have revealed that primary tumor resection (PTR) surgery could improve prognosis in some solid tumors. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether patients with stage IVB cervical carcinoma can benefit from PTR surgery and who can benefit.MethodsWe extracted and obtained data on patients with stage IVB cervical carcinoma from the SEER database from 2010 to 2017 and classified them into two groups: the surgery and the non-surgery group. The overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of the two groups were compared before and after propensity score matching (PSM). The independent prognostic variables were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Then, the model was established to select the optimal patients to receive PTR surgery using multivariate logistic regression.ResultsAfter PSM, the study included 476 cervical carcinoma (stage IVB) patients, of whom 238 underwent PTR surgery. Compared to the non-surgery group, the surgery group’s median OS and median CSS were both longer (median OS: 27 months vs. 13 months, P < 0.001; median CSS: 52 months vs. 21 months, P < 0.001). The model showed no organ metastasis, adenocarcinoma, G1/2, and chemotherapy were more supportive of performing PTR surgery. The calibration curves and DCA showed that the model had high predictive accuracy and excellent clinical applicability. Finally, the “surgery benefit” group had the OS that was approximately four times better than “surgery non-benefit” group.ConclusionPTR surgery can potentially improve the prognosis of patients with cervical carcinoma at stage IVB. The model could probably select optimal candidates and provide a new perspective on individualized treatment.","Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies are emerging in the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as the dominant ablative approach as an alternative to surgery for primary breast cancer in patients who do not wish to have surgery or are poor surgical candidates. Cryoablation is well tolerated and provides excellent local control and cosmesis. Thermal ablation may also be used in the treatment of oligometastatic breast cancer, allowing patients to achieve long disease-free intervals. Transarterial therapies have been studied in the treatment of oligoprogressive hepatic metastasis, though further supportive data would be helpful to demonstrate its efficacy.",0
"PurposeThis study aimed to explore the clinical implications of ctDNA for epidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) as the first-line treatment in EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in real-world settings.MethodsA total of 122 patients with NSCLC who underwent tissue and liquid next generation sequencing (NGS) tests were included. 66 patients with detected EGFR mutation in both tumor-tissue and plasma were included into the EGFRt+, p+ group, and 56 patients with EGFR mutation detected only in tumor-tissue were included into the EGFRt+, p− group. The differences in clinical characteristics, concomitant mutations and prognosis between the two groups were compared.ResultsThe detection rate of the EGFRt+, p+ group was 54.1% (66/122). EGFRt+, p+ in the NGS test was particularly relevant to the size of tumors, liver metastasis, bone metastasis and TP53 mutation. In patients with TP53 mutation in ctDNA, the detection rate of EGFR mutation in ctDNA was up to 91.3%. EGFRt+, p+ could be an independent prognostic factor for first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment. Combination therapy seems to be a promising approach to improve the outcome for EGFRt+, p+ (P = 0.017, HR 0.509 [95% CI 0.288–0.897]). Moreover, the combination of TP53 mutated status and EGFRm status in plasma showed a better completion of risk stratification for PFS (Log-rank P < 0.001).ConclusionsCo-detection of EGFR mutation in tumor tissue and plasma is an independent prognostic factor for first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment. Moreover, combination therapy could be a promising approach to improve the outcome for these patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03952-z.","PurposeEmerging evidence suggests that pyroptosis plays an essential role in the development and progression of multiple cancers. However, the role of pyroptosis remains elusive in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).MethodsThe expression profile data of DLBCL and normal samples of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) were analyzed, and the clinical characteristics of DLBCL patients were further investigated. A prognostic model was established using LASSO-Cox regression analysis. The expression of these PRGs was validated by qRT-PCR in DLBCL cell lines. Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry were utilized to explore the impact of pyroptosis inhibitor (disulfiram, DSF) combined with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor (BMS1166) on DLBCL cell proliferation.ResultsMost PRGs were dysregulated in DLBCL samples and associated with overall survival (OS). Six PRGs were selected to construct a prognostic risk score model. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that CASP8, CASP9, NLRP1, NLRP6, and TIRAP are downregulated, while SCAF11 was significantly upregulated in DLBCL cell lines. This prognostic model divided DLBCL patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited lower mortality and longer OS than those in the high-risk group. The ROC curve and nomogram demonstrated this model's excellent predictive performance. GO and KEGG enrichment indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between subgroups were associated with cellular protein modification processes and JAK-STAT signaling pathway regulation. Moreover, the risk score was correlated with the immune profile. Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry further validated the synergistic anti-tumor effects of DSF and BMS1166 on DLBCL cells.ConclusionIn summary, we developed a comprehensive prognostic model based on PRGs characteristics, which accurately predicted the prognosis of DLBCL patients. Pyroptosis-targeting coupled with immunotherapies would be a promising therapeutic strategy for DLBCL.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05018-0.",1
"ABSTRACTCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a powerful measure of minimal residual disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although immunotherapy has been widely established in metastatic CRC that is mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H), its role in non-metastatic CRC is rapidly evolving. In resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage II CRC, adjuvant fluoropyrimidine has no benefit and is not recommended. There is growing evidence to suggest diminished benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation in localized CRC that is dMMR/MSI-H. We present two cases of dMMR/MSI-H stage III CRC treated with definitive surgery wherein adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy led to a failure to clear postoperative plasma ctDNA levels, prompting a change to immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab and resultant ctDNA clearance. We illustrate that chemotherapy may achieve suboptimal disease control in localized colon cancer that is dMMR/MSI-H, while plasma ctDNA offers a window of opportunity to gauge the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy to clear microscopic disease in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer. These findings are important to contextualize given that relapse is inevitable with failure to clear MRD in the postoperative stage I-III CRC setting whereby chemotherapy remains the standard adjuvant therapy in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer.","BackgroundPatients with glioma have limited treatment options and experience poor prognoses. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the relevance of WSC domain-containing 2 (WSCD2) expression to glioma, clinicopathological characteristics, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TILs), and patient prognosis.MethodsWe analyzed WSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues and patient survival using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database. Furthermore, the relationship between the expressions of WSCD2 mRNA and TILs in gliomas was evaluated utilizing the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Lastly, we employed multiplex immunohistochemistry to detect the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues.ResultsWSCD2 mRNA expression in glioma tissues was lower than that in tissues of benign brain disease. High WSCD2 mRNA expression was also significantly associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, WSCD2 mRNA expression was correlated with TIL expression in glioma; however, no such relationship was detected between the protein expressions of WSCD2 and TILs in glioma tissues. Cox regression multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that WSCD2 expression in glioma tissues could be an independent prognostic factor.ConclusionThis study highlights the correlation between WSCD2 expression and TILs and demonstrates the prognostic significance of WSCD2 in glioma. Furthermore, our results suggest that WSCD2 may be a potential immunotherapy target in glioma.",1
"AbstractBackground:Neoadjuvant therapy enhances the possibility of achieving radical resection and improves the prognosis for locally advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal extent of resection for locally advanced proximal GC after neoadjuvant therapy.Methods:In this study, 330 patients underwent resection in Peking University Cancer Hospital, with curative intent after neoadjuvant therapy for histologically confirmed proximal GC from January 2009 to December 2022.Results:In this study, 45 patients underwent proximal gastrectomy (PG), while 285 underwent total gastrectomy (TG). After propensity-score matching, 110 patients (71 TG and 39 PG) were included in the analysis. No significant differences between PG and TG regarding short-term outcomes and long-term prognosis were found. Specifically, PG demonstrated comparable overall survival to TG (P = 0.47). Subgroup analysis revealed that although not statistically significant, PG showed a potential advantage over TG in overall survival for patients with tumor-long diameters less than 4 cm (P = 0.31). However, for those with a long diameter larger than 4 cm, TG had a better survival probability (P = 0.81). No substantial differences were observed in baseline characteristics, surgical safety, postoperative recovery, and postoperative complications.Conclusion:For locally advanced proximal GC with objective response to neoadjuvant therapy (long diameter <4 cm), PG is an alternative surgical procedure.","ObjectivesThis study aimed to compare the efficacy of local excision (LE) and intersphincteric resection (ISR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieved a significant or complete pathological response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients with stage ypT0-1ycN0 low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy who underwent LE or ISR between June 2016 and June 2021. Baseline characteristics, short-term outcomes, long-term oncological outcomes, and functional outcomes, were compared between the two groups. To reduce the selection bias, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was performed.ResultsThis study included 106 patients (LE group: n = 51, ISR group: n = 55). There were significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (P < 0.05). After IPTW, there were almost no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. The LE group showed less postoperative complications and better function outcomes compared to the ISR group. The LE group had significantly lower rates of complications (13.7% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.014). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of long-term oncological outcomes.ConclusionsFor patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer achieving significant or complete pathological response after neoadjuvant therapy, both LE and ISR present comparable oncological outcomes. Yet, LE seems to show more advantages in terms of postoperative complications and functional outcomes. These findings offer important insights for surgical decision-making, emphasizing the necessity to consider both oncological and functional outcomes in selecting the optimal surgical approach.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05454-y.",1
"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for adrenal gland metastasis, with a focus on the assessment of the irradiated subjects’ endocrinological function.Materials and methodsA total of 36 patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2020 in this prospective phase II trial. Patients were treated with Linac-based SBRT, with a dose of 45 Gy in 3 consecutive fractions. Primary end-point was local control (LC) of the treated lesions and secondary end-points included evaluation of acute and late toxicity, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and the impact on the hormonal production of adrenal glands.ResultsWith a median follow-up of 9.5 months, LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 94.7% and 88.4%, respectively. Rates of PFS at 1 and 2 years were 50.5% and 29.8%, with a median PFS of 14.7 months. Rates of OS at 1 and 2 years were 62.9% and 44.1%. At univariate analysis, oligorecurrence was associated with better OS compared to oligoprogressive or synchronous metastatic disease. No grade 3 or greater toxicities were registered and only a minority of patients (22.2%) reported mild treatment-related side effects. Hormonal and electrolytes production was assessed before and after treatment, showing only a slight and transient variation within the reference ranges.ConclusionSBRT on adrenal metastases has been confirmed to be a feasible and effective treatment. With an excellent disease control and the preservation of the endocrine function, SBRT with ablative dose can be considered a viable alternative to more invasive approaches.","BackgroundRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 80–90% of all kidney tumors and about 15–25% of patients will develop distant metastases. Systemic therapy represents the standard of care for metastatic patients, but stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) may play a relevant role in the oligoprogressive setting, defined as the progression of few metastases during an ongoing systemic therapy on a background of otherwise stable disease. Aim of the present study was to analyze the outcome of RCC patients treated with SABR on oligoprogressive metastases.Materials and methodsIn this monocenter study, we analyzed patients affected by RCC treated with SABR on a maximum of 5 cranial or extracranial oligoprogressive sites of disease. Endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity.ResultsWe included 74 oligoprogressions (26 intracranial and 48 extracranial) and 57 SABR treatments in 44 patients. Most common concomitant treatments were sunitinib (28, 49.1%), pazopanib (12, 21.0%) and nivolumab (11, 19.3%). Median follow-up was 19.0 months, and 1- and 2-year OS rates were 79.2% and 57.3%, respectively. Repeated SABR was a positive predictive factor for OS (p = 0.034). Median PFS was 9.8 months, with 1- and 2-year rates of 43.2% and 25.8%. At multivariable analysis, disease-free interval (p = 0.022) and number of treated metastases (p = 0.007) were significant for PFS. About 80% of patients continued the ongoing systemic therapy 1- and 2-years after SABR with no grade 3 or 4 toxicities.Conclusionswe confirmed the efficacy and safety of SABR for oligoprogression from RCC, with the potential to ablate resistant metastases and to prolong the ongoing systemic therapy.",1
"Blockade of the TGFβ signaling pathway has emerged from preclinical studies as a potential treatment to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and several other types of cancer. However, clinical translation of first-generation inhibitors has shown little success. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of HYL001, a potent inhibitor of TGFβ receptor 1 (ALK5), that is approximately 9 times more efficacious than the structurally related compound galunisertib, while maintaining a favorable safety profile. HYL001 in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1) eradicates liver metastases generated in mice by microsatellite stable, aggressive colorectal cancer tumors at doses where galunisertib is ineffective.","Several new discoveries have revived interest in the pathogenic potential and possible clinical roles of IL-18. IL-18 is an IL-1 family cytokine with potent ability to induce IFNγ production. However, basic investigations and now clinical observations suggest a more complex picture. Unique aspects of IL-18 biology at the levels of transcription, activation, secretion, neutralization, receptor distribution and signaling help to explain its pleiotropic roles in mucosal and systemic inflammation. Blood biomarker studies reveal a cytokine for which profound elevation, associated with detectable ‘free IL-18’, defines a group of autoinflammatory diseases in which IL-18 dysregulation can be a primary driving feature, the so-called ‘IL-18opathies’. This impressive specificity might accelerate diagnoses and identify patients amenable to therapeutic IL-18 blockade. Pathogenically, human and animal studies identify a preferential activation of CD8+ T cells over other IL-18-responsive lymphocytes. IL-18 agonist treatments that leverage the site of production or subversion of endogenous IL-18 inhibition show promise in augmenting immune responses to cancer. Thus, the unique aspects of IL-18 biology are finally beginning to have clinical impact in precision diagnostics, disease monitoring and targeted treatment of inflammatory and malignant diseases. diseases.",0
"AbstractAs cancer patients with intracranial metastatic disease experience increasingly prolonged survival, the diagnosis and management of recurrent brain metastasis pose significant challenges in clinical practice. Prior to deciding upon a management strategy, it is necessary to ascertain whether patients have recurrent/progressive disease vs adverse radiation effect, classify the recurrence as local or distant in the brain, evaluate the extent of intracranial disease (size, number and location of lesions, and brain metastasis velocity), the status of extracranial disease, and enumerate the interval from the last intracranially directed intervention to disease recurrence. A spectrum of salvage local treatment options includes surgery (resection and laser interstitial thermal therapy [LITT]) with or without adjuvant radiotherapy in the forms of external beam radiotherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. Nonoperative salvage local treatments also range from single fraction and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS/FSRS) to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Optimal integration of systemic therapies, preferably with central nervous system (CNS) activity, may also require reinterrogation of brain metastasis tissue to identify actionable molecular alterations specific to intracranial progressive disease. Ultimately, the selection of the appropriate management approach necessitates a sophisticated understanding of patient, tumor, and prior treatment-related factors and is often multimodal; hence, interdisciplinary evaluation for such patients is indispensable.","ObjectivesThe aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with recurrent and metastatic sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and evaluate the current treatment strategies to help guide future management.DesignThis is a retrospective cohort study.SettingThe study was conducted at six international tertiary treatment centers.ParticipantsPatients with documented diagnoses of recurrent or metastatic SNUC since 1983 were included in the study.Main Outcome MeasuresPatient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected. Primary outcome measures included disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), and time to recurrence (TTR) following initial treatment. Further univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess for prognostic factors.Results A total of 97 patients with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 52.4 (15.6) were identified, 15 of whom presented with metastatic SNUC and 90 of whom developed recurrence. Management in both populations was widely variable. For patients with metastatic disease, the 1-year DSS probability was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8–100%). For patients with recurrent SNUC, the 1- and 5-year DSS probabilities were 45.7% (95% CI, 31.9–65.6%) and 8.6% (95% CI, 2.9–25.3%), respectively. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) TTR was 8 months (3–18.5 months). Multivariable analyses revealed a significant association between orbital involvement on initial presentation and TTR (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.28; 95% CI, 1.45–7.42; p = 0.004). ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study addressing metastatic and recurrent SNUC based on a large patient cohort. Orbital extension of the primary SNUC may predict a higher probability of recurrence following treatment, suggesting the possible utility of a more aggressive treatment in this subgroup of patients. A heterogenous patient population and wide variability in management emphasize the challenges in standardizing care; however, dismal survival rates demonstrate the necessity for further evaluation of current approaches to improve evidence-based recommendations.",1
"Aim: Studies on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related potential neurological adverse events (pNAEs) in Korean lung cancer (LC) patients are scarce. We aimed to examine ICI prescription trends from 2018 to 2022, patient characteristics and factors associated with ICI prescription or concurrent pNAEs in LC.Research design & methods: This observational, cross-sectional study of Korean LC patients investigated four ICIs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab). The annual ICI prescription rate was calculated by dividing the number of LC patients prescribed ICIs with the total annual number of LC patients. Factors associated with ICI prescriptions or concurrent pNAEs were assessed.Results: The annual ICI prescription rate increased from 3.29% to 9.74% (average: 6.20%). Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were associated with more ICI prescriptions (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.08). Targeted therapy was associated with fewer prescriptions (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.41–0.49). The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) prescription rate was higher in patients with concurrent pNAEs than those without pNAEs (53.09% vs. 50.84%), and this was associated with higher pNAEs prevalence (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03–1.18).Conclusion: ICI prescription for LC has increased in Korea, CCI and anti-PD-1 increased pNAEs prevalence.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",1
"PurposeTo develop a radiomics nomogram based on dual-phase enhanced computed tomography (CT) for predicting the Ki-67 index status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods137 patients with NSCLC who had undergone dual-phase enhanced CT scans and Ki-67 examination within 2 weeks were retrospectively enrolled between January 2020 and December 2022. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and the patients were categorized based on low or high expression of Ki-67 index, with a cut-off value of 40%. The cohort was randomly divided into a training group (n = 95) and a testing group (n = 42) at a ratio of 7:3. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was employed to select the most valuable radiomics features from the dual-phase enhanced CT images. Subsequently, a nomogram that incorporated the radiomics score and clinical factors associated with Ki-67 index status was established through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The predictive performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsThe AUC values of the radiomics features of artery phase and vein phase CT in the testing group were 0.748 and 0.758, respectively. The AUC of the dual-phase enhanced CT was 0.785, and the AUC of the developed nomogram was 0.859, which was higher than those of the radiomics (AUC, 0.785) and clinical models (AUC, 0.736).ConclusionsThe radiomics nomogram based on dual-phase enhanced CT images provides a promising method for predicting the Ki-67 index status in patients with advanced NSCLC.","AbstractIntroductionAdjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluated the effects of adjuvant ICI treatment duration on RFS and overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence.MethodsThe RFS and OS of patients from three centers who received either adjuvant ICI therapy or active surveillance after curative hepatic resection between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, were analyzed. Further analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of ICI treatment duration on RFS and OS.ResultsA total of 1,271 patients were included, of whom 1,032 (81.2%) received active surveillance and 239 (18.8%) received adjuvant ICI therapy. The median RFS in the adjuvant therapy cohort was 22.6 months (95% CI 18.3–26.9), significantly higher than the RFS of 19.1 months (95% CI 16.4–21.4) in the active surveillance cohort (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66–0.95; p = 0.019). The median OS was not reached for either group, but OS tended to be better in the adjuvant therapy cohort than in the active surveillance group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.94; p = 0.010). Similar results were obtained after propensity score matching. Among patients who received adjuvant ICI therapy, those who received it for longer than 6 months had slightly higher RFS (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42–1.04; p = 0.071) and OS (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.30–1.17; p = 0.128) than those who received it for up to 6 months.ConclusionsAdjuvant ICI therapy significantly improves the prognosis of patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after curative resection. Six months of adjuvant ICI treatment may be insufficient.",0
"Inflammation and a dysregulated immune system are common denominators in cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) highlighted the convergence of interleukin (IL)-1β biology in cancer and CVD, and the potential of anti–IL-1β drugs for the treatment of both disease entities. Accumulating evidence further supports the role of the innate immunity members and IL-1β activators, S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in both cancer and CVD. This review outlines the common involvement of S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in cancer and CVD. Specifically, their time-, cell-, and context-dependent actions and hereto-related dichotomous role in different cancers and CVD are addressed, highlighting the need for further insights to allow tailored therapies.","Chlorogenic acid (CGA) exhibits promising anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory conditions and allergic rhinitis (AR). This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of CGA on inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophage cells and on AR in mice. RAW264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammation and cultured with varying concentrations of CGA, a Tlr4-silenced gene (shTlr4) transfection, and the MAPK/NF-κB pathway activator diprovocim. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK8 assay, while levels of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α, and IL-6 were measured by Griess colorimetry, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. Expression and phosphorylation levels of the MAPK/NF-κB pathway were evaluated using qPCR and western blotting. Additionally, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR mice received different doses of CGA, and Toll-like receptor-4 (Tlr4) overexpression was induced. In vitro, CGA treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced cell activity, NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 secretion, and downregulated Tlr4, p-p38, p-p65, and p-IκB expression. Tlr4 inhibition suppressed cell activity and inflammation by blocking MAPK/NF-κB pathway activation. Conversely, Tlr4 overexpression counteracted the effects of CGA, increasing cell activity and inflammatory factor concentration. In OVA-induced AR mice, CGA effectively alleviated allergic symptoms, reduced inflammatory factor secretion, and inhibited TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB pathway activity. These findings suggest CGA’s potential as an anti-inflammatory agent in RAW264.7 cells and AR models through modulation of the TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB pathway.",1
"ABSTRACTTetrandrine (Tet), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid from Stephania tetrandra, is noted for its diverse pharmacological effects but faces limitations in clinical use due to toxicity, poor solubility, and low bioavailability. Researchers are working to address these issues by developing Tet derivatives with greater therapeutic potential through structural modification. Generally, key modifications include: 1) introducing an aromatic heterocycle or a hydrophobic alkyne unit at the C-5 position can enhance its antitumor activity; 2) adding an amide, sulfonamide, or electron-withdrawing group at the C-14 position can enhance its antitumor activity; 3) changing its structure to a quaternary ammonium salt can alter its solubility and greatly boost its antibacterial activity; 4) structural modification of the C-12-methoxybenzyl motif can enhance its metabolic stability and thus change the activity of the analogs; 5) Tet structural simplification may result in the identification of anticancer lead compounds with novel mechanisms of action. This review systematically summarizes these modification strategies and evaluates the biological activities of Tet derivatives, aiming to guide further optimization and facilitate the discovery of lead analogs with improved efficacy. The future direction and possibility of Tet structural optimization are also considered.","FGFR has been considered a crucial oncogenic driver and promising target for cancer therapy. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of 3-amino-N-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-methylpyrazine-2-carboxamide derivatives as novel FGFR inhibitors. SAR exploration led to the identification of 18i as a pan-FGFR inhibitor with favorable in vitro activity against FGFR1–4. Moreover, 18i blocked the activation of FGFR and downstream signaling pathways at the submicromolar level and exhibited potent antitumor activity in multiple cancer cell lines with FGFR abnormalities. Molecular docking was performed to investigate the possible binding modes of 18i within the binding site of FGFR2. These results suggest that compound 18i is a promising candidate for further drug discovery.",1
"Although deubiquitinases (DUBs) have been well described in liver tumorigenesis, their potential roles and mechanisms have not been fully understood. In this study, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) as an oncogene with essential roles during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. USP1, with elevated expression levels and clinical significance, was identified as a hub DUB for HCC in multiple bioinformatics datasets. Functionally, USP1 overexpression significantly enhanced the malignant behaviors in HCC cell lines and spheroids in vitro, as well as the zebrafish model and the xenograft model in vivo. In contrast, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP1 dramatically impaired the phenotypes of HCC cells. Specifically, ectopic USP1 enhanced aggressive properties and metabolic reprogramming of HCC cells by modulating mitochondrial dynamics. Mechanistically, USP1 induced mitochondrial fission by enhancing phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 via deubiquitination and stabilization of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which could be degraded by the E3 ligase NEDD4L. The USP1/CDK5 modulatory axis was activated in HCC tissues, which was correlated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, Prasugrel was identified as a candidate USP1 inhibitor for targeting the phenotypes of HCC by an extensive computational study combined with experimental validations. Taken together, USP1 induced malignant phenotypes and metabolic reprogramming by modulating mitochondrial dynamics in a CDK5-mediated Drp1 phosphorylation manner, thereby deteriorating HCC progression.","PurposeFluoropyrimidine (FP) with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC); however, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy critically affects the quality of life of patients. Maintenance strategies with FP plus bevacizumab have been well-established; nonetheless, the real-world outcomes of maintenance therapy with FP and cetuximab are unclear. We investigated the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent maintenance therapy with cetuximab.MethodsWe retrospectively identified and analyzed patients with mCRC who were treated between 2012 and 2021 with first-line oxaliplatin-based induction chemotherapy (IC) plus biologic agents (either cetuximab or bevacizumab), and underwent maintenance therapy (IC regimen without oxaliplatin) after IC.ResultsIn total, 19 patients who were treated with mFOLFOX6 (FP/leucovorin/oxaliplatin) with cetuximab, and 26 patients who were treated with mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab were included. In the cetuximab group, all patients were KRAS-, NRAS-, and BRAF-wild type, whereas most patients in the bevacizumab group harbored KRAS or BRAFV600E or NRAS mutants. During the maintenance treatment, seven patients (four [21%] in the cetuximab group and three [11%] in the bevacizumab group) achieved partial response after achieving nadir during induction chemotherapy. The disease control rates of maintenance therapy were 79% and 74% in the cetuximab and bevacizumab groups, respectively. The median progression-free survival of maintenance therapy and overall survival was 5.98 months and 32.4 months in the cetuximab group, and 4.83 months and 25.6 months in the bevacizumab group, respectively.ConclusionsMaintenance therapy with FP plus biologic agents (either bevacizumab or cetuximab) is a feasible strategy for appropriate mCRC patients according to their RAS/BRAF status. Further large-scale randomized studies are needed to validate the efficacy of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor-based maintenance therapy.",0
"The compounds derived from Traditional Chinese Medicines have shown various pharmacological activities with unique advantages, especially in the aspect of antitumor. Neferine (Nef), a natural compound, extracted from green seed embryos of Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) also exerts antitumor effects on cancers. In this study, the effects and mechanisms of Nef on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were evaluated. The results showed that Nef had the antitumor effects in vivo and in vitro. Nef significantly suppressed cell viability and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells, with elevated reactive oxygen species and reduced BCL2/BAX ratio. Nef was also demonstrated to inhibit the invasion, metastasis and EMT process of NSCLC cells, and attenuate EMT-related changes of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin at both transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, we concluded that the inhibitory effects of Nef on EMT was achieved by targeting Rho-associated protein kinase 1, a protein mediating the process of EMT in various cancers. These results showed that Nef had a significant antitumor effect on NSCLC cells by inducing apoptosis and blocking EMT, providing the therapeutical prospect on NSCLC treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04280-y.","Breast cancer represents the most frequently diagnosed form of cancer among women on a global scale. In recent years, there has been a notable increase in interest among researchers in exploring alternative therapeutic methods, including stem cell therapy. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned media (AD-MSCs-CM) on apoptosis induction and migration inhibition of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) in vitro. In this study, malignant breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) were cultured separately in DMEM/F12/FBS (15%) culture media under standard conditions. Subsequently, the conditioned media derived from AD-MSCs was introduced to the MDA-MB-231 cells. Following a 24- and 48-hour exposure period, the expression levels of CASP3, KRAS, and MMP9 were evaluated using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. Furthermore, the proliferation and migration abilities of the cancer cells were evaluated using MTT and wound healing assays, respectively. Furthermore, the protein expression of Caspase-3, K-RAS, and MMP-9 was examined using a western blot assay. It is noteworthy that the expression levels of the MMP9 and KRAS genes were significantly reduced following treatment with AD-MSCs-CM in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the CASP3 gene expression level was found to have increased significantly in the treated groups. Additionally, the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with AD-MSCs-CM was markedly diminished by MTT and wound healing assays. Moreover, the AD-MSCs-CM was observed to induce caspase-3 activation and reduce the protein expression of K-RAS and MMP-9. The results of this study indicate that AD-MSCs-CM may exert an influence on the apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of breast cancer cells. Consequently, it could be proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for the suppression of breast cancer. However, further testing and research are required to validate these findings and to ascertain the full potential of this approach.",1
"Objective.HER2 is an important prognostic and therapeutic target in uterine serous carcinoma (USC). Optimal HER2 testing platforms have not been defined and guidelines for testing have changed over time. Our objective is to assess the concordance of HER2 positivity based on chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and next generation sequencing (NGS) and to determine the rate of downstream mutations that may affect response to HER2 directed therapy.Methods.Utilizing the Caris tumor registry, 2192 USC tumors were identified and analyzed using NGS (NextSeq, 592 Genes and WES, NovaSEQ), IHC, and CISH. PD-L1 expression was tested by IHC. Microsatellite instability was tested by fragment analysis, IHC, and NGS. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was measured by totaling somatic mutations per tumor. HER2 positivity through IHC and CISH was determined based on 2007 and 2018 ASCO/CAP HER2 breast cancer guidelines.Results.There was a higher rate of HER2 positivity by IHC when using the 2018 guidelines compared to the 2007 guidelines (16.3% vs 12.3%). Concordance between IHC and CISH was 98.9%. ERBB2 amplification was identified by NGS in 10.5% of tumors. Compared to CISH results, this corresponds to a concordance rate of 91.6% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 60.3%. Single gene alterations in HER2 amplified tumors that may implicate HER2 therapy resistance included PI3K (33.1%), KRAS (2.5%), and PTEN (1.3%).Conclusions.There was high concordance between HER2 positivity based on CISH and IHC. Rate of HER2 positivity is the lowest by NGS. Ultimately these testing platforms need to be validated by response to targeted therapy.","Purpose:Transcriptional profiling of pancreatic cancers (PC) has defined two main transcriptional subtypes, classical and basal. Initial data suggest shorter survival for patients with basal tumors and differing treatment sensitivity to FOLFIRINOX (FFX) and gemcitabine nab-Paclitaxel (GnP) by transcriptional subtype.Experimental Design:We examined 8,743 patients with RNA sequencing from PCs performed at Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ). Classical and basal subtypes were identified using PurIST algorithm on RNA-sequencing and two cohorts were analyzed:  Biomarker cohort included patients with complete molecular profiling data (n = 7,250);  Outcomes cohort included patients with metastatic disease with available survival outcomes (n=5,335). 3,842 patients were shared between the two cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess patient survival.Results:In the biomarker cohort, 3,063 tumors (42.2%) were strongly classical (SC), and 2,015 tumors (27.8%) were strongly basal (SB). SC and SB tumors showed strong associations with histologic phenotypes and biopsy site. SB tumors had higher rates of KRAS, TP53, and ARID1A mutations, lower rates of SMAD4 mutation, and transcriptional evidence of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Sixty of 77 cases (78%) maintained their transcriptional subtype between temporally and/or spatially disparate lesions. In the outcomes cohort, SB subtype was associated with shorter overall survival time, regardless of whether they received FFX or GnP as first line chemotherapy. Mutant KRAS allele type was prognostic of outcomes, however this impact was restricted to SC tumors, whereas all mutant KRAS alleles had similarly poor outcomes in SB tumors.Conclusions:SB subtype is a strong independent predictor of worse outcomes, irrespective of upfront chemotherapy regimen. Clinical trials should further investigate PC transcriptional subtypes as a prognostic and predictive biomarker.",0
"Brain tumors such as glioblastomas are resistant to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, largely due to limited T cell infiltration in the tumors. Here, we show that mice bearing intracranial tumors exhibit systemic immunosuppression and T cell sequestration in bone marrow, leading to reduced T cell infiltration in brain tumors. Elevated plasma corticosterone drives the T cell sequestration via glucocorticoid receptors in tumor-bearing mice. Immunosuppression mediated by glucocorticoid-induced T cell dynamics and the subsequent tumor growth promotion can be abrogated by adrenalectomy, the administration of glucocorticoid activation inhibitors or glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, and in mice with T cell-specific deletion of glucocorticoid receptor. CCR8 expression in T cells is increased in tumor-bearing mice in a glucocorticoid receptor-dependent manner. Additionally, chemokines CCL1 and CCL8, the ligands for CCR8, are highly expressed in bone marrow immune cells in tumor-bearing mice to recruit T cells. These findings suggested that brain tumor-induced glucocorticoid surge and CCR8 upregulation in T cells lead to T cell sequestration in bone marrow, impairing the anti-tumor immune response. Targeting the glucocorticoid receptor-CCR8 axis may offer a promising immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of intracranial tumors.","The field of onco-microbiome is rapidly expanding. Multiple studies have shown the crucial role of gut microbiota in the regulation of nutrient metabolism, immunomodulation and protection against pathogens. Tools for manipulating the gut microbiota include dietary modification and faecal microbiota transfer. Accumulating evidence has also documented the application of specific intestinal microbiome in cancer immunotherapy, notably in enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aim of this review is to focus on the East Asian microbiome and to provide a current overview of microbiome science and its clinical application in cancer biology and immunotherapy.",1
"BackgroundIt is unknown how the cell cycle plays a role in breast cancer (BC). This study aimed to establish a clinically applicable predictive model to predict the therapeutic responses and overall survival in BC patients.Materials and methodsCell cycle-related genes (CCGs) were identified within the Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (n is equal to 1001) and the Gene Expression Omnibus cohort (n is equal to 3265). An analysis of univariate and multivariate Cox was then conducted to develop a nomogram based on CCGs. After validating the nomogram, risk cohort stratification was established and the predictive value was examined. Finally, immune cell infiltration and therapeutic responses were analysed.ResultsBased on 15 CCGs, 4 prognostic predictors were identified and entered into the nomogram. According to the curves of calibration, the estimated and observed value of the nomogram is in optimal agreement. Subsequently, stratification into two risk cohorts showed that the predictive value, immune cell infiltration and overall survival were better among patients with low risk. Immune checkpoint expression in patients with BC at higher risk was downregulated. Furthermore, the results of the study revealed that doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cisplatin and vinorelbine all had higher IC50 values in patients with high-risk BC.ConclusionThe nomogram based on CCG could assess tumour immune micro-environment regulation and therapeutic responses of immunotherapy in BC. Moreover, it may provide novel information on the control of immune micro-environment infiltration in BC and aid in the development of targeted immunotherapy.","Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) based liquid kidney biopsies have the potential to detect the chances of kidney transplant rejection. Several studies have found that dd-cfDNA can be used to determine the risk of kidney transplant rejection and may correlate with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A high concentration of dd-cfDNA in the body fluids may indicate possible transplant rejection since dd-cfDNA is released as a result of apoptotic and necrotic processes initiated by the recipient’s immune system. dd-cfDNA assays have advantages over conventional biopsies since they are noninvasive, and therefore, have the potential to provide a safe and reliable biomarker. Different dd-cfDNA levels have been reported above a number of cutoff thresholds: ABMR at 2.45% and TCMR at 1.3%, compared with 0.44% in healthy patients; and eGFR at 2.5%, a decrease of 25% compared with healthy patients. These results indicate the levels of dd-cfDNA that may be used to signal possible kidney rejection. dd-cfDNA assay is a rapid technique, making it particularly useful in emergencies, and further research into its use in the study of kidney rejection should prove beneficial.",0
"PurposeThe low objective response of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a great challenge in advanced melanoma therapy. Interferon-alpha has been proven to be a promising combination regimen with ICI in a phase Ib/II trial. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of interferon-alpha 1b plus PD-1 monoantibody in a real-world Chinese metastatic melanoma cohort.MethodsProfiles of patients diagnosed with unresectable stage IV (AJCC 8th Edition) between December 1st, 2018 and February 28th, 2022 from the Department of Dermatology, Xijing Hospital were reviewed. All of them received the combination treatment of interferon-alpha 1b (600 μg every other day) plus PD-1 monoantibody (Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or Toripalimab 240 mg or Sintilimab 200 mg, every 3 weeks) for at least 12 weeks. The efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V1.1). The safety data were identified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) V.5.0.ResultsIn total, 70 patients were included. 50% were females. 52.9% were with ECOG performance status ≥ 1. The fraction of patients receiving Pembrolizumab, Toripalimab, and Sintilimab was 28.6%, 67.1%, and 4.3%, respectively. Acral and mucosal subtypes accounted for 48.6% and 20%. The median follow-up period is 15.1 months. The objective response rate was 32.8%. The median time of overall survival was 18 months (95% CI 14.2–21.8 months), and the median time of PFS was 5.2 months (95% CI 4.2–6.2 months). The incidence of adverse events (any grade) was 98.6%, but only 8.6% of cases experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions.ConclusionThe combination of interferon-alpha 1b and PD-1 monoantibody demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects and acceptable toxicity in Chinese metastatic melanoma patients with cutaneous, acral, and mucosal subtypes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04596-3.","BackgroundPreviously, albendazole (ABZ) has been reported as an anti-parasitic drug rather than anti-tumor drug. Our study aim to investigate whether ABZ also has a potential anti-tumor effect by shaping the tumor immune microenvironment and interrogate whether ABZ could synergize with the PD-L1 blockade.MethodsC57BL/6 mice (C57) were intravenously injected with B16F10-luciferase (B16-luc) cells to establish a lung metastatic melanoma model and subcutaneously inoculated with B16-luc cells to establish a subcutaneous tumor model. The tumor volume and tumor metastasis loci of the mice were measured by a vernier caliper and in vivo imaging. RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the different genes and pathways of immune cells in the tumors. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the different subsets of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.ResultsThe results suggested that ABZ significantly inhibited lung melanoma metastasis with decreased fluorescence intensity and nodule score and mediated the regression of subcutaneous melanoma in mice with decreased tumor volume. Moreover, RNA sequencing results showed that ABZ regulated the gene expression levels and pathways of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Meanwhile, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence showed that the number and percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells were enhanced in tumors after ABZ treatment. Furthermore, the combination of ABZ and anti-PD-L1 treatment significantly potentiated anti-tumor efficacy in both lung metastasis and subcutaneous melanoma models and mediated an increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells as compared to the control group.ConclusionABZ inhibits melanoma growth and metastasis. Moreover, ABZ synergized with PD-L1 blockade mediates tumor regression.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05415-5.",1
"AbstractBackgroundMicrosatellite instable (MSI) gastric cancers exhibit reduced lymph node (LN) metastasis and improved survival compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) counterparts. However, to our longstanding observation, clinical N-staging (cN) is frequently overestimated in MSI cases. The clinical implications and underlying mechanisms of this discrepancy warrant further investigation.Materials and methodsWe conducted a comprehensive review of clinicopathological data from a 141 MSI and 1119 MSS gastric cancer patients. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and its receptor VEGFR-3 were assessed using qPCR and immunohistochemistry. High-parameter flow cytometry was employed to analyze subsets of CD8+ T cells within the tumors.ResultsMultivariate analysis revealed that MSI status was an independent prognostic factor, alongside the LN ratio and AJCC8 pathology staging. MSI gastric cancers exhibited a reduced LN ratio, particularly at advanced T-staging, compared to MSS counterparts, while maintaining an equivalent LN yield. Overestimation of cN by computed tomography preoperatively was frequent in MSI gastric cancers but was more commonly underestimated in MSS counterparts. VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 expression were lower in MSI tumors. MSI gastric cancers showed an increased total number of CD8+ T cells, albeit with a lower proportion of effector memory cells expressing CD45RA (EMRA) and CD8+ CXCR4+ T cells, compared to MSS counterparts.ConclusionFrequent overestimation of clinical N-staging in MSI gastric cancers is associated with VEGF-C signaling and CD8+ T-cell dynamics and should be cautiously interpreted, as it might misguide therapeutic options.","Objective and aimQuality of life and quality of care are determinants that interact on the patients’ health and satisfaction with care. The aim of the study is to investigate the satisfaction factors of day clinic cancer patients that influence their quality of life. The identification of the important health sectors and the improvement of the weak areas contribute to the amelioration of cancer patients’ state of health as well as to the increase of their satisfaction with the day care unit.MethodsThe research is a cross-sectional, quantitative, descriptive and correlation study. It was conducted in a cancer day care unit of an oncology hospital in Greece, from January 2022 to July 2022. A convenient sample of 101 cancer outpatients with different diagnoses and disease progression completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-EORTCQLQ-30 and a validated satisfaction questionnaire for ambulatory patients based on the SERVQUAL quality dimensions.ResultsHigher satisfaction regarding waiting (rho=0.20; p=0.041), medical care (rho=0.23; p=0.023), nursing care (rho=0.25; p=0.014) and overall satisfaction (rho=0.25; p=0.012) was significantly positively associated with better general health status. Accordingly, patients’ satisfaction with reception (rho=0.21; p=0.039), waiting (rho=0.20; p=0.050), medical care (rho=0.24; p=0.019), nursing care (rho=0.25; p=0.013) and overall satisfaction (rho=0.25; p=0.014) were related positively to significantly better social functioning. Satisfaction with waiting was also significantly positively associated with better emotional functioning (rho=0.24; p=0.018), while satisfaction with medical care was correlated with better cognitive functioning (rho=0.21; p=0.041). Fatigue levels were significantly associated with patients’ dissatisfaction with medical (rho=−0.23; p=0.021) and nursing care (rho=−0.23; p=0.024).ConclusionsCancer patients’ satisfaction with the healthcare provided in the day clinic has a significant impact on their quality of life which is improved by prompt and effective medical and nursing interventions as well as by well organized health services.",0
"The gut microbiota influences the effectiveness and side effects of cancer treatments, particularly immunotherapy and associated immune-related complications. This important involvement of the microbiome is supported by the patients receiving antibiotics responding poorly to immunotherapy. Relatively few research has examined the underlying processes, and until recently, data regarding the detection of the microbial organisms that trigger these effects were inconsistent. Since then, a deeper comprehension of the processes of action and taxonomic classification of the relevant species has been attained. It's been demonstrated that certain bacterial species can enhance the body’s reaction to immune checkpoint inhibitors through the release of distinct metabolites or products. Nonetheless, in certain patients who are not responding, Gram-negative bacteria may have a dominating suppressive impact. Patients' propensity to react to immunotherapy can be somewhat accurately predicted by machine learning techniques based on their microbiome makeup. Consequently, there has been an increase in interest in modifying the microbiome makeup to enhance patient reaction to medication. Clinical proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that dietary modifications or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might be used therapeutically to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients. Current developments and new approaches for microbiota-based cancer treatments have been emphasized. In conclusion, preclinical research on animals and human clinical trials has made tremendous progress in our understanding of the function of the gut microbiome in health and illness. These investigations have shed light on the effects of food, FMT, probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiome-disease connections. However, there are still a lot of issues and restrictions that must be resolved before this research can be used in real-world clinical settings.Graphical Abstract","Immunotherapy has revolutionized the systemic treatment of solid tumors, including advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC), providing durable responses with a favorable safety profile. Multiple immune checkpoint inhibitor agents have been approved in monotherapy in second-line setting, and for a selected group of chemo-naïve cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression. Despite the incorporation of immunotherapy to the systemic treatment landscape of aUC, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in frontline setting for vast majority of patients. Urothelial carcinoma is a chemosensitive disease with response rates of up to 50% to frontline chemotherapy. However, the response to chemotherapy is short lasting with vast majority of patients experiencing disease progression and death within months. In this context, maintenance therapy constitutes an attractive therapeutic strategy to maximize the time to treatment failure. Different cytotoxic and targeted agents have been investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC but have not shown an impact on survival. Avelumab has become the first and only drug to improve overall survival as maintenance therapy after frontline platinum-based therapy in aUC patients and the first drug to be approved in this setting. This article will review the rational for maintenance therapy, the different drugs investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC, and the impact of avelumab maintenance therapy as a new standard of care in the management of aUC.",1
"AbstractBackground:Durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) failed to bring survival benefits to patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in PACIFIC study (evaluating durvalumab in patients with stage III, unresectable NSCLC who did not have disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy). We aimed to explore whether locally advanced inoperable patients with EGFR mutations benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the optimal treatment regimen.Methods:We searched the PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to December 31, 2022 and performed a meta-analysis based on a Bayesian framework, with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoints.Results:A total of 1156 patients were identified in 16 studies that included 6 treatment measures, including CRT, CRT followed by durvalumab (CRT-Durva), TKI monotherapy, radiotherapy combined with TKI (RT-TKI), CRT combined with TKI (CRT-TKI), and TKI combined with durvalumab (TKI-Durva). The PFS of patients treated with TKI-containing regimens was significantly longer than that of patients treated with TKI-free regimens (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20–0.66). The PFS of TKI monotherapy was significantly longer than that of CRT (HR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.50–0.87) but shorter than RT-TKI (HR = 1.78, 95% CI, 1.17–2.67). Furthermore, the PFS of RT-TKI or CRT-TKI were both significantly longer than that of CRT or CRT-Durva. RT-TKI ranked first in the Bayesian ranking, with the longest OS (60.8 months, 95% CI = 37.2–84.3 months) and the longest PFS (21.5 months, 95% CI, 15.4–27.5 months) in integrated analysis.Conclusions:For unresectable stage III EGFR mutant NSCLC, RT and TKI are both essential. Based on the current evidence, RT-TKI brings a superior survival advantage, while CRT-TKI needs further estimation. Large randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to explore the appropriate application sequences of TKI, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.Registration:PROSPERO;  No. CRD42022298490.","PurposeFor patients with advanced HCC, predictors of immunotherapy response are scarce, and the benefits of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment after immunotherapy are unclear. We explored whether clinical features, such as target lesion response, immune-mediated toxicity, or subsequent TKI therapy predict immunotherapy response.MethodsWe retrospectively studied 77 patients with advanced HCC receiving immunotherapy. Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed using various statistical methods, including the log-rank test and Kaplan–Meier methods. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used for multivariable survival analysis.ResultsFor all patients, median overall survival (mOS) was 13 months (95% CI 8–19), and median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 6 months (95% CI 4–10). Patients with partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) compared to progressive disease (PD) had prolonged mPFS (27 vs. 5 vs. 1 month(s), p < 0.0001) and mOS (not met vs. 11 vs. 3 months, p < 0.0001). Patients with vs. without immune-mediated toxicities trended towards longer mPFS (9 vs. 4 months p = 0.133) and mOS (17 vs. 9 months; p = 0.095). Patients who did vs. did not receive a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) after immunotherapy had a significantly improved mOS (19 vs. 5 months, p = 0.0024)). Based on multivariate modeling, the hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) of patients receiving TKI vs. no TKI was 0.412 (p = 0.0043).ConclusionWe show that disease control predicts prolonged mOS and mPFS. Furthermore, TKI therapy administered after immunotherapy predicts prolonged mOS in patients with advanced HCC.",1
"IntroductionMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, treatment-resistant tumor. Anoikis is a particular type of programmed apoptosis brought on by the separation of cell–cell or extracellular matrix (ECM). Anoikis has been recognized as a crucial element in the development of tumors. However, few studies have comprehensively examined the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in malignant mesothelioma.MethodsARGs were gathered from the GeneCard database and the Harmonizome portals. We obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the GEO database. Univariate Cox regression analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were utilized to select ARGs associated with the prognosis of MPM. We then developed a risk model, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves were employed to confirm the ability of the model. The patients were divided into various subgroups using consensus clustering analysis. Based on the median risk score, patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups. Functional analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were conducted to estimate molecular mechanisms and the immune infiltration landscape of patients. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis and tumor microenvironment landscape were further explored.ResultsA novel risk model was constructed based on the six ARGs. The patients were successfully divided into two subgroups by consensus clustering analysis, with a striking difference in the prognosis and landscape of immune infiltration. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that the OS rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than the high-risk group. Functional analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis showed that high- and low-risk groups had different immune statuses and drug sensitivity.ConclusionsIn summary, we developed a novel risk model to predict MPM prognosis based on six selected ARGs, which could broaden comprehension of personalized and precise therapy approaches for MPM.","BackgroundAccumulating evidence suggests that anoikis resistance is a key process in cancer cell metastasis, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Therefore, anoikis may become a new treatment for gastric cancer.MethodsWe used the univariate Cox regression method to screen gastric cancer-related anoikis genes, and a prognostic risk model was established. We analyzed differences between high- and low-risk groups in terms of tumor infiltrating immune cells, gene mutation signatures, and treatment of gastric cancer. Analysis of model associated genes at single-cell resolution was performed.ResultsWe filtered to 12 anoikis-related genes and built a prognostic risk model using seven of them, which performed well in multiple datasets. Patients with CCDC178 mutations had a worse prognosis. We also found that patients at low risk were more likely to benefit from chemotherapy and immunotherapy. ERBB2 was found to be highly expressed in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Our analysis also indicated that gastric cancer samples with high infiltration of iCAFs had a worse prognosis.ConclusionSeven anoikis-related genes were selected to establish a risk model. The model can be used to predict the prognosis of patients and guide the drug treatment, which provides a new idea for the evaluation and treatment of gastric cancer patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05157-4.",1
"Despite the enthusiasm for targeted cancer therapies in preclinical studies and the success of a select few drugs, many promising drug candidates fail in clinical trials. The gap between preclinical promise and clinical outcomes underscores the need to investigate factors influencing the success or failure of targeted therapies. Dasatinib, an inhibitor of Abl and Src protein tyrosine kinases, is highly effective toward chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by targeting BCR-Abl, but it is ineffective against solid tumors when targeting Src kinases. A review reveals cytotoxic inhibition is a key attribute predictive of dasatinib’s clinical efficacy toward CML, and cytostatic inhibition by targeting Src kinases is the underlying reason for the preclinical promise and clinical inefficacy toward solid tumors. The analysis reveals that preclinical cytotoxic inhibition is highly predictive of clinical efficacy and shows that cancer regression can only be achieved when the drug–target is an essential oncogenic driver in a monodriver cancer. The analysis highlights dasatinib’s potential in achieving stable disease in solid tumors, supporting its use in combination therapies.","ABSTRACTKirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation is prognostic of poor survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS G12C mutations occur in 13% of NSCLC cases and despite the frequency of this mutation, advances in drug development against KRAS have historically been impeded due to the extremely high affinity of KRAS for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and the lack of a binding pocket on the surface of KRAS that is suitable for drug binding. Sotorasib, a first-in-class, highly selective KRAS G12C inhibitor overcomes this issue by irreversibly binding in the switch-II pocket. Sotorasib was granted accelerated FDA approval for the treatment of KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This review summarizes the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and clinical considerations of sotorasib.",1
"PD-L1 is a glycoprotein present on antigen-presenting cells and malignant cells and activates the PD-L1 receptor on cells surfaces, leading to T-cell anergy and death. The objective of this study was to assess PD-L1 tumoral expression in 50 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, define its prognostic value, and investigate its association with 2-year overall survival, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, and a number of other clinicopathological parameters. In a 24-month prospective observational study, involving 50 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients, PD-L1 tumoral expression was evaluated using semiquantitative immunohistochemistry analysis by an experienced pathologist. PD-L1 expression of ≥ 6% of tumor cells was associated with poor survival outcome and determined to be a pertinent clinical cutoff value. PD-L1 expression of ≥ 6% was significantly associated with a number of clinicopathological parameters in our study of 50 patients with OSCC. Pathological nodal staging (P = 0.00), lympho-vascular invasion (P = 0.03), extra-nodal extension (P = 0.04), overall staging (P = 0.01), locoregional recurrence (P = 0.00), and distant metastasis (P = 0.00) all showed statistically significant associations. Our study concluded a significant correlation with decreased 2-year overall survival and 2-year disease free survival by using the Kaplan- Meier survival plot for overall survival (p = 0.02) and (p = 0.0002), respectively. The presence of ≥ 6% PD-L1 (CD274) tumoral expression was found to be significantly associated with 2-year overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRC), distant metastasis (DM), and various clinicopathological parameters. Tumoral PD-L1 was found as a discrete prognostic biomarker which showed significant association with tumor aggressiveness.","BackgroundMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a heterogeneous disease in which molecular stratification is needed to improve clinical outcomes. The identification of predictive biomarkers can have a major impact on the care of these patients, but the availability of metastatic tissue samples for research in this setting is limited.ObjectiveTo study the prevalence of immune biomarkers of potential clinical utility to immunotherapy in mCRPC and to determine their association with overall survival (OS).Design, setting, and participantsFrom 100 patients, mCRPC biopsies were assayed by whole exome sequencing, targeted next-generation sequencing, RNA sequencing, tumor mutational burden, T-cell–inflamed gene expression profile (TcellinfGEP) score (Nanostring), and immunohistochemistry for programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), SRY homology box 2 (SOX2), and the presence of neuroendocrine features.Outcome measurements and statistical analysisThe phi coefficient determined correlations between biomarkers of interest. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) from Cox regression.Results and limitationsPD-L1 and SOX2 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (combined positive score ≥1 and >5% cells, respectively) in 24 (33%) and 27 (27%) mCRPC biopsies, respectively; 23 (26%) mCRPC biopsies had high TcellinfGEP scores (>–0.318). PD-L1 protein expression and TcellinfGEP scores were positively correlated (phi 0.63 [0.45; 0.76]). PD-L1 protein expression (aHR: 1.90 [1.05; 3.45]), high TcellinfGEP score (aHR: 1.86 [1.04; 3.31]), and SOX2 expression (aHR: 2.09 [1.20; 3.64]) were associated with worse OS.ConclusionsPD-L1, TcellinfGEP score, and SOX2 are prognostic of outcome from the mCRPC setting. If validated, predictive biomarker studies incorporating survival endpoints need to take these findings into consideration.",1
"Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the most common type of Gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma with known complications such as bleeding, obstruction and perforation. In this article we present a 59-year-old male patient diagnosed with Peripheral T cell Lymphoma – Not Otherwise Specified (PTCL-NOS) with GI involvement was started on chemotherapy. On day 2 post completion of first cycle of chemotherapy, patient had presented to the emergency department with sudden onset abdominal pain and distension. On evaluation, he was diagnosed with multiple perforations in the small bowel. Patient underwent exploration with primary repair of few perforations and ileal resection with double barrel ileostomy. Chemotherapy plays an important role in the management of NHL. One well-known NHL consequence, intestinal perforation, can happen at the time of initial presentation or after starting chemotherapy. Surgeons should be aware of possibility of such complications and high-risk factors for perforation. At present, there is no role for elective surgery in GI lymphoma and is mainly reserved for complications like uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or perforation.","BackgroundCAR-T cell (chimeric antigen receptor T) therapy is now part of standard of care treatment of B‑cell lineage malignancies. Although it is an effective treatment, it comes along with adverse side effects and toxicities that may require intensive care therapy. The costs related to critical care therapy in critically ill patients after CAR‑T administration have not been evaluated.Patients and methodsRetrospective analysis of all patients who had received CAR‑T therapy and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care university medical centre in Germany between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2022. Cause of admission and ICU therapy as well as treatment and total hospitals costs were evaluated.ResultsThirty patients with a history of CAR-T cell therapy for underlying haematological malignancy were included. The median age of all patients was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 50–70) and 37% (n = 11) were female. 93% (n = 28) of patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 7% (n = 2) had multiple myeloma. The cohort was stratified whether the ICU admission was CAR‑T therapy related (that is within 30 days after CAR‑T therapy; 73%, n = 22) or the admission was of an other cause (> 30 days after CAR‑T therapy) (27%, n = 8). The median duration from CAR‑T therapy to ICU admission was 6 (range 5–8) days in CAR-T cell therapy associated ICU admissions compared with 52 (range 31–126) days in other admissions. The overall illness severity on admission was numerically higher in CAR-T-related ICU admission compared to other admissions (46 vs. 43 points, p = 0.18). Vasopressor therapy (50% vs. 75%; p = 0.19), invasive mechanical ventilation (27% vs. 50%; p = 0.24) and renal replacement therapy (14% vs. 50%; p < 0.05) were used in CAR-T-associated admission compared to other admissions, respectively. The ICU mortality (23% vs. 50%; p = 0.15) was higher in patients with other ICU admission. Median total costs of the entire inpatient stay in hospital were € 27,845 (range 8661–368,286 €) in CAR-T-associated ICU admissions compared to € 59,234 (range 23,182–127,044 €) in the group of other ICU admissions (costs of the CAR‑T product not included).ConclusionIn relation to the total costs of CAR-T-cell therapy (production of the CAR‑T product), therapy-associated complications have a relatively low impact on the costs and utilization of ICU resources.Supplementary InformationThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00063-024-01230-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"Objective and aimQuality of life and quality of care are determinants that interact on the patients’ health and satisfaction with care. The aim of the study is to investigate the satisfaction factors of day clinic cancer patients that influence their quality of life. The identification of the important health sectors and the improvement of the weak areas contribute to the amelioration of cancer patients’ state of health as well as to the increase of their satisfaction with the day care unit.MethodsThe research is a cross-sectional, quantitative, descriptive and correlation study. It was conducted in a cancer day care unit of an oncology hospital in Greece, from January 2022 to July 2022. A convenient sample of 101 cancer outpatients with different diagnoses and disease progression completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-EORTCQLQ-30 and a validated satisfaction questionnaire for ambulatory patients based on the SERVQUAL quality dimensions.ResultsHigher satisfaction regarding waiting (rho=0.20; p=0.041), medical care (rho=0.23; p=0.023), nursing care (rho=0.25; p=0.014) and overall satisfaction (rho=0.25; p=0.012) was significantly positively associated with better general health status. Accordingly, patients’ satisfaction with reception (rho=0.21; p=0.039), waiting (rho=0.20; p=0.050), medical care (rho=0.24; p=0.019), nursing care (rho=0.25; p=0.013) and overall satisfaction (rho=0.25; p=0.014) were related positively to significantly better social functioning. Satisfaction with waiting was also significantly positively associated with better emotional functioning (rho=0.24; p=0.018), while satisfaction with medical care was correlated with better cognitive functioning (rho=0.21; p=0.041). Fatigue levels were significantly associated with patients’ dissatisfaction with medical (rho=−0.23; p=0.021) and nursing care (rho=−0.23; p=0.024).ConclusionsCancer patients’ satisfaction with the healthcare provided in the day clinic has a significant impact on their quality of life which is improved by prompt and effective medical and nursing interventions as well as by well organized health services.","AbstractBackgroundThe pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE—an animal model of MS) is primarily mediated by T cells. However, recent studies have only focused on interleukin (IL)‐17‐secreting CD4+ T‐helper cells, also known as Th17 cells. This study aimed to compare Th17 cells and IL‐17‐secreting CD8+ T‐cytotoxic cells (Tc17) in the context of MS/EAE.MethodsFemale C57BL/6 mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptides 35–55 (MOG35–55), pertussis toxin, and complete Freund's adjuvant to establish the EAE animal model. T cells were isolated from the spleen (12–14 days postimmunization). CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were purified using isolation kit and then differentiated into Th17 and Tc17, respectively, using MOG35–55 and IL‐23. The secretion levels of interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) and IL‐17 were measured via enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay using cultured CD4+ and CD8+ T cell supernatants. The pathogenicity of Tc17 and Th17 cells was assessed through adoptive transfer (tEAE), with the clinical course assessed using an EAE score (0–5). Hematoxylin and eosin as well as Luxol fast blue staining were used to examine the spinal cord. Purified CD8+ CD3+ and CD4+ CD3+ cells differentiated into Tc17 and Th17 cells, respectively, were stimulated with MOG35–55 peptide for proliferation assays.ResultsThe results showed that Tc17 cells (15,951 ± 1985 vs. 55,709 ± 4196 cpm; p < 0.050) exhibited a weaker response to highest dose (20 μg/mL) MOG35–55 than Th17 cells. However, this response was not dependent on Th17 cells. After the 48 h stimulation, at the highest dose (20 μg/mL) of MOG35–55. Tc17 cells secreted lower levels of IFN‐γ (280.00 ± 15.00 vs. 556.67 ± 15.28 pg/mL, p < 0.050) and IL‐17 (102.67 ± 5.86 pg/mL vs. 288.33 ± 12.58 pg/mL; p < 0.050) than Th17 cells. Similar patterns were observed for IFN‐γ secretion at 96 and 144 h. Furthermore, Tc17 cell‐induced tEAE mice exhibited similar EAE scores to Th17 cell‐induced tEAE mice and also showed similar inflammation and demyelination.ConclusionThe degree of pathogenicity of Tc17 cells in EAE is lower than that of Th17 cells. Future investigation on different immune cells and EAE models is warranted to determine the mechanisms underlying MS.",0
"Multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) can be achieved using different commercially available platforms, often making use of conjugated antibodies detected in iterative cycles. A growing portfolio of pre-conjugated antibodies is offered by the providers, as well as the possibility for in-house conjugation. For many conjugation methods and kits, there are limitations in which antibodies can be used, and conjugation results are sometimes irreproducible. The conjugation process can limit or slow down the progress of studies requiring conjugation of essential markers needed for a given project. Here, we demonstrate a protocol combining manual indirect immunofluorescence (IF) of primary antibodies, followed by antibody elution and staining with multiplexed panels of commercially pre-conjugated antibodies on the PhenoCycler platform. We present detailed protocols for applying the workflow on fresh frozen and formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. We also provide a ready to use workflow for coregistration of the images and demonstrate this for two examples.","AbstractIntroductionDurvalumab plus tremelimumab combination therapy (STRIDE regimen) is a new first-line option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), but little real-world data are available to determine which patients are most likely to respond.MethodsThis study retrospectively evaluated patients with uHCC who were treated with the STRIDE regimen as the 1st line at our hospital. The primary endpoint of the study was the objective response rate (ORR). We focused on identifying factors associated with cases that had a favorable response.ResultsTwenty-one patients were included. In best response, there were 11 partial response cases, with an ORR of 52.4%. Median progression-free survival was 6.8 months, and overall survival did not reach the median time. A high tumor-to-liver ratio of the maximum value of the standardized uptake value (TLR) on baseline fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was associated with response, while TLRs were significantly higher in poorly differentiated uHCC.ConclusionThe STRIDE regimen may be beneficial for systemic therapy-naive uHCC patients. High TLR on baseline FDG-PET could be a potentially useful biomarker for response.",0
"BackgroundSinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) comprises <1% of all head and neck cancers but has one of the highest 5-year mortalities.MethodsA systematic review and analysis using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses) guidelines was conducted on SNMM survival, recurrence, and prognostic factors.Results A total of 2,379 abstracts were reviewed resulting in 90 studies describing 3347 SNMM patients. Patients were 49.65% male and 66.5 years old. Surgery plus radiation therapy, followed by surgery only, then radiation only were the most common treatments. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy were used in 418 patients and 101 respectively. The 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals are 55.97, 40.09, and 30.35%, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival and disease-specific survival are 25.56 and 38.04%. The 5-year local, regional, and distant recurrence-free survivals are 42.35, 81.64, and 44.65%. Mean survival after diagnosis was 26.99 months. Local ( n = 650), regional ( n = 226), and distant ( n = 723) failure presented after 19.36, 6.35, and 12.42 months. Sites of metastasis were lung, liver, bone, brain, skin, kidney, and adrenal glands. Distant metastases, disease in the paranasal sinuses, and higher stage were noted to have worse survival outcomes. Positive margins did not significantly impact overall survival in 11/12 studies. ConclusionOverall survival over 20 years has remained poor with 70% of patients deceased in 5 years. About half of patients will develop distant failure and will thereafter rapidly decline. These data indicate need for advances in treatment of SNMM and new efforts with targeted immunotherapy offer a promising avenue toward improving survival outcomes.","Aim: This cohort study evaluated the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and mortality as well as ICI discontinuation among older adults with NSCLC.Methods: 2007–2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database was used and survival analysis with time-varying exposure of irAEs was applied to estimate the associations.Results & conclusion: A total of 8,175 individuals were included, with 46.8% of whom developed an irAE. Cox regression models showed the occurrence of any irAEs was associated with increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.63–1.82) and treatment discontinuation (HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.78–1.97). Some variability was observed in the effect on the two outcomes depending on the type of irAE.",1
"BackgroundMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a major occupational and environmental neoplasm. The purpose of this study was to validate the clinical and epidemiological factors, diagnosis, and initial treatment among MPM patients in the Hokushin region.MethodsWe surveyed retrospective data from 152,921 cancer patients in 22 principal hospitals.ResultsA total of 166 MPM cases were newly diagnosed. These patients consisted of 136 men and 30 women, with a median age of 69 years. We estimated the incidence rate for MPM to be 0.55 cases per 100,000 person-years in this study. The ratio per 100,000 population-years was 0.39 in Fukui, 0.60 in Ishikawa, 1.02 in Toyama and 0.35 in Nagano. Forty-five patients were discovered when diagnosed incidentally in patients under observations for other diseases. Forty-six cases were diagnosed as localized disease, while 13 had accompanying regional lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, 44 cases showed infiltration into adjacent organs. A histo-cytological diagnosis was made in 164 cases (98.8%). A surgical approach, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were performed for 33, 88, and 6 patients, respectively, while 44 patients (26.5%) received best supportive care. Multimodality therapy was conducted in just 3.0% of the MPM patientsConclusionMPM has a tragically rapid progression if discovered under observations for other diseases. Workers in health-related fields should be on high alert for aggressive MPM. Better evaluation and multi-disciplinary approaches to MPM in these regions are needed to optimize multimodality therapy.","IntroductionMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, treatment-resistant tumor. Anoikis is a particular type of programmed apoptosis brought on by the separation of cell–cell or extracellular matrix (ECM). Anoikis has been recognized as a crucial element in the development of tumors. However, few studies have comprehensively examined the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in malignant mesothelioma.MethodsARGs were gathered from the GeneCard database and the Harmonizome portals. We obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the GEO database. Univariate Cox regression analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were utilized to select ARGs associated with the prognosis of MPM. We then developed a risk model, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves were employed to confirm the ability of the model. The patients were divided into various subgroups using consensus clustering analysis. Based on the median risk score, patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups. Functional analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were conducted to estimate molecular mechanisms and the immune infiltration landscape of patients. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis and tumor microenvironment landscape were further explored.ResultsA novel risk model was constructed based on the six ARGs. The patients were successfully divided into two subgroups by consensus clustering analysis, with a striking difference in the prognosis and landscape of immune infiltration. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that the OS rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than the high-risk group. Functional analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis showed that high- and low-risk groups had different immune statuses and drug sensitivity.ConclusionsIn summary, we developed a novel risk model to predict MPM prognosis based on six selected ARGs, which could broaden comprehension of personalized and precise therapy approaches for MPM.",1
"BackgroundAccounting for tumor heterogeneity, cancer stem cells (CSC) are involved in tumor metastasis, relapse, and drug resistance. Genes regulating CSC characteristics in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were explored and validated in this study.MethodsThe mRNA stemness index (mRNAsi) of more than 500 LUAD cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were calculated using a one-class logistic regression machine learning algorithm based on the mRNA expression of pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. mRNAsi-related key genes were identified by weighted correlation network analysis. The expression levels and prognostic roles of key genes were analyzed in Oncomine, PrognoScan, and Kaplan–Meier plotter databases, and validated using data from our center.ResultsThe mRNAsi was significantly higher in LUAD compared with normal lung tissues. LUAD patients of advanced stage exhibited a higher mRNAsi and worse overall survival (OS). Eight key genes were identified: heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSPA4), cell division cycle associated 7 (CDCA7), cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CAP-GLY domain containing linker protein 1 (CLIP1), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), H2A histone family, member X (H2AFX), and Bloom syndrome, RecQ helicase-like (BLM). These genes were differentially expressed in various types of malignancies and validated in the LUAD cases. LUAD patients with low expression of CDC20, CDK1, CCNB1, H2AFX, or BLM had a significantly better OS, whereas OS was reduced for patients with low expression of CLIP1. In addition, the expression of CDCA7 did not significantly impact the OS of LUAD patients. The protein–protein interaction networks evaluated by STRING demonstrated strong relationships between these key genes, which were validated in our cases.ConclusionsThe mRNAsi was significantly higher in LUAD compared with normal samples. Eight mRNAsi-related key genes were associated with prognosis and the cell cycle, and were strongly correlated with each other and differentially expressed in tumor and normal samples. We provide a new strategy for exploring stemness-related genes in LUAD cases.","BACKGROUND:Cancer is a dynamic process and thus requires highly informative and reliable biomarkers to help guide patient care. Liquid-based biopsies have emerged as a clinical tool for tracking cancer dynamics. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipid bilayer delimited particles secreted by cells, are a new class of liquid-based biomarkers. EVs are rich in selectively sorted biomolecule cargos, which provide a spatiotemporal fingerprint of the cell of origin, including cancer cells.CONTENT:This review summarizes the performance characteristics of EV-based biomarkers at different stages of cancer progression, from early malignancy to recurrence, while emphasizing their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and screening biomarkers. We discuss the characteristics of effective biomarkers, consider challenges associated with the EV biomarker field, and report guidelines based on the biomarker discovery pipeline.SUMMARY:Basic science and clinical trial studies have shown the potential of EVs as precision-based biomarkers for tracking cancer status, with promising applications for diagnosing disease, predicting response to therapy, and tracking disease burden. The multi-analyte cargos of EVs enhance the performance characteristics of biomarkers. Recent technological advances in ultrasensitive detection of EVs have shown promise with high specificity and sensitivity to differentiate early-cancer cases vs healthy individuals, potentially outperforming current gold-standard imaging-based cancer diagnosis. Ultimately, clinical translation will be dictated by how these new EV biomarker-based platforms perform in larger sample cohorts. Applying ultrasensitive, scalable, and reproducible EV detection platforms with better design considerations based upon the biomarker discovery pipeline should guide the field towards clinically useful liquid biopsy biomarkers.",0
"ObjectivesPrior researches indicate that peripheral blood CD4 levels have an inverse correlation with distant tumor metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the linear relationship between CD4 and distant metastasis lacks clarity. Hence, the objective of this study was to ascertain the linear relationship between CD4 and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients.MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed clinical and laboratory data of NSCLC patients between March 2016 and July 2022 at the Cancer Hospital of Anhui University of Technology. The study first applied a generalized summation model and smoothing curve fitting to determine if there was a linear relationship between CD4 and NSCLC metastasis. Secondarily, univariate logistic analysis and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the odds ratio (OR) of CD4 as a continuous variable, dichotomous variable, and trichotomous variable when predicting NSCLC metastasis. In addition, stratified and subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the reliability of CD4 in different NSCLC patient populations.ResultsThe study included a total of 213 NSCLC patients, among which 122 had distant metastasis and 91 had no metastasis. The smoothing curve fitting analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between CD4 and NSCLC metastasis with a threshold effect. The univariate logistic analysis indicated that continuous CD4 expression was not significantly associated with NSCLC metastasis (P = 0.051); however, high levels of CD4 expression (≥ 35.06%) were found to be a protective factor against NSCLC metastasis when CD4+ T was a dichotomous variable (OR = 0.49, P = 0.010). Furthermore, multivariate linear regression models showed that low (< 32%) or high levels (> 44%) of CD4 significantly increased the risk of NSCLC metastasis compared to medium levels (32–44%) when CD4+ T was trichotomized. The significance was maintained in stratified analysis in relation to age, sex, type of pathology, smoke, PS, and T stage. CD4 levels were U-shaped in relation to different sites of distant metastases (bone, brain, liver), but not with lung metastases.ConclusionsA threshold effect is shown to exist between the peripheral blood CD4 and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients. It was revealed that the risk of distant metastasis is lower when CD4 is maintained between 32 and 44%, whereas low (< 32%) or high (> 44) levels of CD4 are associated with an increased risk of distant metastasis in NSCLC patients.","PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.",1
"ABSTRACTCancer is increasingly being recognized as a global health issue with considerable unmet medical need. Despite the rapid progression of anticancer pharmaceuticals, there are still significant challenges for the effective management of cancer. In many circumstances, cancer cells are difficult to detect and treat. Combination of nanovesicles (NVs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), referred as magnetic nanovesicles (MNVs), is now well recognized as a potential theranostic option for improving cancer treatment outcomes and reducing adverse effects. MNVs can be used for monitoring the long-term fate and functional benefits of cancer therapy. Moreover, MNV-mediated hyperthermia mechanism has been explored as a potential technique for triggering cancer cell death, and/or controlled release of laden cargo. In this review, we focus on the unique characteristics of MNVs as a promising avenue for targeted drug delivery, diagnosis, and treatments of cancer or tumor. Moreover, we discuss critical considerations related to the issues raised in this area, which will guide future research toward better anti-cancer therapeutics for clinical applications.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a debilitating inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination, is significantly influenced by polygenic variations. Although the precise cause of MS remains unclear, it is believed to arise from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Recent investigations have focused on the polygenic nature of genetic alterations linked to MS risk. This review highlights the critical role of these genetic variants in shaping disease susceptibility and progression. Specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB50*101, HLA-DR2+, HLA-DQ6, DQA 0102, and DQB1 0602, are implicated in immune modulation, significantly increasing the risk of developing MS. Additionally, Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified non-HLA genetic variants that contribute to MS susceptibility, including IL-2RA (rs2104286), IL-7R (rs6897932), CD40 (rs1883832 T), CD58 (rs2300747), and others, each playing a role in immune regulation and disease progression. Dysfunctions in genes regulating myelin integrity, such as MOG (Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein), MAG (Myelin-associated Glycoprotein), and PLP1 (Proteolipid Protein 1), further drive MS pathogenesis. Moreover, viral infections, notably Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and measles virus, may exacerbate the development of MS by triggering immune responses. Understanding the contribution of these genetic and viral factors may shed light on the complex etiology of MS. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) provide a valuable tool for estimating MS susceptibility based on the cumulative effect of genetic variants. However, translating these genetic insights into clinical practice requires further validation, including environmental considerations. Investigating MS polygenicity could lead to personalized therapies, enhancing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, ultimately improving outcomes for MS patients.",1
"Purpose:Neoadjuvant anti-PD-(L)1 therapy improves the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in unselected triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Given the potential for long-term morbidity from immune-related adverse events (irAEs), optimizing the risk-benefit ratio for these agents in the curative neoadjuvant setting is important. Suboptimal clinical response to initial neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is associated with low rates of pCR (2–5%) and may define a patient selection strategy for neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade. We conducted a single-arm phase II study of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel as the second phase of NAT in patients with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)-resistant TNBC (NCT02530489).Methods:Patients with stage I-III, AC-resistant TNBC, defined as disease progression or a <80% reduction in tumor volume after 4 cycles of AC, were eligible. Patients received atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3weeks x4) and nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2 IV,Q1 week x12) as the second phase of NAT before undergoing surgery followed by adjuvant atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3 weeks, x4). A two-stage Gehan-type design was employed to detect an improvement in pCR/residual cancer burden class I (RCB-I) rate from 5% to 20%.Results:From 2/15/2016 through 1/29/2021, 37 patients with AC-resistant TNBC were enrolled. The pCR/RCB-I rate was 46%. No new safety signals were observed. Seven patients (19%) discontinued atezolizumab due to irAEs.Conclusion:This study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a promising signal of activity in this high-risk population (pCR/RCB-I=46% vs 5% in historical controls), suggesting that a response-adapted approach to the utilization of neoadjuvant immunotherapy should be considered for further evaluation in a randomized clinical trial.","BackgroundAtezolizumab plus bevacizumab and lenvatinib are the current first-line systematic therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). However, the selection of initial treatment among the two therapies are controversial. This meta-analysis aims to compare efficacy and safety between atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and lenvatinib.MethodsWe systematically searched for studies on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and lenvatinib in the online databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. The outcome data including overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), tumor response and adverse events (AEs), were independently extracted by two authors in a standardized way.ResultsEight retrospective cohort studies with 3690 patients (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab: 1680, lenvatinib: 2010) were included in the meta-analysis. The atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group had significant longer PFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.76, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.65–0.88; I squared statistic (I2) = 0.0%, p = 0.590], compared with lenvatinib group but no significant difference in OS (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75–1.01; I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.597), objective response rate (ORR) [risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–1.02; I2 = 19.3%, p = 0.283] and disease control rate (DCR) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98–1.09; I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.467) among them. Moreover, patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab exhibited lower incidences of grade 3/4 AEs than those receiving lenvatinib (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51–0.83; I2 = 69.3%, p = 0.003). However, in non-viral patients group, lenvatinib delivered favorable outcomes in OS (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04–1.67; I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.380) compared with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.ConclusionAtezolizumab plus bevacizumab provides potential advantage in efficacy and better safety than lenvatinib in the treatment of uHCC. Lenvatinib is an appropriate effective alternative to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in patients without viral infecting.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05342-5.",1
"BackgroundGiven the widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), newer immune related adverse events (irAEs) have come to light, including flare-ups of preexisting autoimmune disorders (AIDs) and delayed immune-related events. We aimed to identify the frequency and severity of new IRAEs, including AID flares in cancer patients treated with ICIs at our institution. We also studied the tolerability of ICIs upon rechallenge in patients with irAEs and hospital admissions due to irAEs in a community setting in rural Maine.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective chart review analysis of all patients with cancer who received anti-PDL1/PDL1 inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab at our tertiary care center from November 2015 to March 2019. Demographic data, cancer type and stage, irAEs, hospital admissions due to irAEs, and drug treatment information was extracted.ResultsWe included 465 patients who received ICIs, 115 (out of 465 25%) developed new irAEs. Preexisting AID were identified in 47 (out of 465) (10%), AID flares were observed in 12 patients (25% of 47). 17 (out of 47 36%) were on immunosuppression for underlying AID, 5 (out of 17, 29%) developed flares. Overall, 148 (32% of 465) irAEs occurred, as some patients had multiple toxicities. Majority were treated for Lung cancer (63%), followed by melanoma and genitourinary cancers. Due to irAE severity, treatment was permanently discontinued in 15% (out of 465) patients. Hospital admissions due to irAEs were required for 34 patients (7.3% of 465). ICI rechallenge was performed in 27 patients (6% of 465), and majority tolerated well.ConclusionOur study shows that ICIs were generally well tolerated and can be used safely even in patients with preexisting AIDs; it is encouraging to see majority tolerated rechallenge with ICIs well.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibition therapy (ICIT) is an emerging field in oncology especially opening new horizons to chemotherapy refractory patients. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and undesired response patterns such as progression after the initial good response in a subset of patients pose a major challenge and drawback to ICIT. This paper provides deep insight into ICIT related bottlenecks and corresponding effective management and combat strategies for very complex complications.MethodsThe relevant literatures from PubMed have been reviewed. Based on obtained information, rigorous and exhaustive analyses have been made to present novel methods and strategies against ICIT drawbacks and bottlenecks.ResultsThe results show that baseline biomarker tests are very crucial to identify suitable candidates for ICIT and frequent assessments throughout ICIT help to recognize possible irAEs at early stages. Equally important are the necessity for mathematical definitions for the ICIT success rate and optimum duration, and the development of combat mechanisms against loss of sensitivity within the tumor microenvironment (TME).ConclusionRigorous management approaches are presented for mostly observed irAEs. Furthermore, for the first time in the literature, a non-linear mathematical model is invented to measure the ICIT success rate and to decide about the optimum ICIT duration. Finally, a strategy against tumor plasticity is introduced.",1
"AbstractThe emergence of organoids is considered a revolutionary model, changing the landscape of traditional translational research. These three-dimensional miniatures of human organs or tissues, cultivated from stem cells or biospecimens obtained from patients, faithfully replicate the structural and functional characteristics of specific target organs or tissues. In this extensive review, we explore the profound impact of organoids and assess the current state of living organoid biobanks, which are essential repositories for cryopreserving organoids derived from a variety of diseases. These resources hold significant value for translational research. We delve into the diverse origins of organoids, the underlying technologies, and their roles in recapitulating human development, disease modeling, as well as their potential applications in the pharmaceutical field. With a particular emphasis on biobanking organoids for prospective applications, we discuss how these advancements expedite the transition from bench to bedside translational research, thereby fostering personalized medicine and enriching our comprehension of human health.","PurposeGlioma is the most common and fatal type of brain tumour. Owing to its aggressiveness and lethality, early diagnosis and prediction of patient survival are very important. This study aimed to identify key genes and biomarkers for glioma that can guide clinicians in making rapid diagnosis and prognostication.MethodsData mining of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data, and Genotype-Tissue Expression Project brain expression data revealed significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the risk scores of individual patients were calculated. WGCNA was utilized to screen for genes most related to clinical diagnosis. Prognostic genes associated with glioma were selected via combining the LASSO regression with univariate and multivariate Cox regression and protein–protein interaction network analyses. Then, a nomogram was constructed. And CGGA dataset was utilized to validated. The protein expression levels of the signature were detected using the human protein atlas. Drug response prediction was carried out using the package “pRRophetic”.ResultsA six-gene signature (KLF6, CHI3L1, SERPINE1, ANGPT2, TGFBR1, and PTX3) was identified and used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups. Survival, ROC curve, and Cox analyses clarified that the six hub genes were a favourable independent prognostic factor for patients with glioma. A nomogram was set up by integrating clinical parameters with risk signatures, showing high precision for predicting 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-years survival. In addition, the expression of most genes was consistent with protein expression. Furthermore, the sensitivity to the top ten drugs in the GDSC database of the high-risk group was significantly higher than the low-risk group.ConclusionBased on genetic profiles and clinicopathological features, including age, grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status, we constructed a comprehensive prognostic model for patients with glioma. These signatures can be regarded as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of gliomas, possibly providing more therapeutic strategies for future clinical research.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05082-6.",0
"AbstractBackgroundPediatric nail disorders encompass a broad range of conditions. This article aimed to consolidate current knowledge on pediatric nail disorders to enhance diagnostic proficiency and clinical management among healthcare professionals.SummaryPediatric nail disorders present a diagnostic challenge due to their diverse nature. Non-syndromic congenital nail disorders encompass various anomalies such as anonychia/hyponychia, congenital malalignment of the great toenail, and racket thumbs, each with distinct clinical presentations and genetic associations. Syndromic congenital nail disorders, often part of complex syndromes, are characterized by unique features and associated abnormalities. Acquired nail diseases in children, like Beau’s lines and onychomadesis, typically result from trauma or infection, while melanonychia, although rare in children, requires careful monitoring for potential malignant alterations, with consideration for biopsy in cases with concerning features.Key Messages Pediatric nail disorders may pose diagnostic challenges and require a comprehensive understanding of nail anatomy and development.  Congenital nail disorders encompass isolated anomalies and syndromic associations, necessitating thorough evaluation for associated systemic conditions.  Acquired nail diseases may indicate underlying trauma or systemic illness and require careful assessment. Melanonychia in children requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation, emphasizing the importance of consistent follow-up and histopathological examination when necessary.","AbstractPurposeHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is a critical biomarker in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). While the role of HER2-positive tumors in guiding targeted therapies is well-established, the clinical implications of HER2-low expression, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization-negative (ISH-negative), remain undetermined. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance and clinicopathological features of HER2-low AGC.Patients and methodsThis retrospective analysis involved patients with AGC treated with first-line fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy from 2011 to 2020. Patients were categorized into HER2-zero (HER2 IHC 0), HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-negative), and HER2-positive (IHC 2+/ISH-positive or 3+) groups.ResultsAmong 548 patients analyzed, 33.0%, 45.1%, and 21.8% were classified as HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive, respectively. The proportions of male patients, intestinal-type histology, esophagogastric junction/cardia involvement, metastatic disease status, ≥2 metastatic sites, liver metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and high serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels were gradually elevated in the HER2-zero, HER2-low, and HER2-positive groups. Overall survival (median) was 13.8, 13.6, and 23.0 months, respectively, with a non-significant trend favoring HER2-positive over HER2-low (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.80; P = .0672). A delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival between the HER2-zero and HER2-low groups was observed, without reaching statistical significance (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.12; P = .2568).ConclusionPatients with HER2-low status exhibited intermediate and specific clinicopathological features within the HER2-negative category. In terms of prognosis, HER2-low patients showed a worsening trend compared with HER2-positive patients. This evidence implies that HER2-low status represents a distinct clinical subset, bridging the gap between the HER2-zero and HER2-positive profiles.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy may give rise to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), or gas within the bowel wall, has very rarely been observed following ICI therapy, and its clinical significance is unclear. We described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of PI as a possible irAE in cancer patients.MethodsWe retrospectively identified 12 adult cancer patients with radiologic evidence of PI within 1 year after ICI exposure during January 2010–January 2023. Clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were evaluated.ResultsThe median age of our sample was 64 years. The most common cancer types were thoracic/head & neck and gastrointestinal. Eleven patients (92%) received anti-PD-1/L1 monotherapy, while 1 patient (8%) received a combination of anti-PD-1/L1 and anti-CTLA-4. PI occurred a median of 7 months after the first ICI dose. Half the patients (50%) were asymptomatic on diagnosis, and the most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (42%). Six patients experienced complications, namely pneumoperitoneum (n = 6, 50%) and microperforation (n = 1, 8%), identified on imaging. Nine patients were treated with antibiotics and 3 patients were monitored conservatively. Nine patients (75%) resumed cancer treatment after PI.ConclusionPI may develop as an irAE. While half of cases were incidental radiologic findings, management with antibiotics as well as hospitalization for observation may still be appropriate. The decision to restart cancer therapy and possibly resume ICI therapy remains to be elucidated. Further large-scale studies may be warranted to clarify the association between PI and ICI therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05461-z.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS:DNA methylation patterns are highly rearranged in HCCs. However, diverse sources of variation are intermingled in cancer methylomes, precluding the precise characterization of underlying molecular mechanisms. We developed a computational framework (methylation signature analysis with independent component analysis [MethICA]) leveraging independent component analysis to disentangle the diverse processes contributing to DNA methylation changes in tumors.APPROACH AND RESULTS:Applied to a collection of 738 HCCs, MethICA unraveled 13 stable methylation components preferentially active in specific chromatin states, sequence contexts, and replication timings. These included signatures of general processes associated with sex and age but also signatures related to specific driver events and molecular subgroups. Catenin beta 1 mutations were major modulators of methylation patterns in HCC, characterized by a targeted hypomethylation of transcription factor 7–bound enhancers in the vicinity of Wnt target genes as well as a widespread hypomethylation of late-replicated partially methylated domains. By contrast, demethylation of early replicated highly methylated domains was a signature of replication stress, leading to an extensive hypomethylator phenotype in cyclin-activated HCC. Inactivating mutations of the chromatin remodeler AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A were associated with epigenetic silencing of differentiation-promoting transcriptional networks, also detectable in cirrhotic liver. Finally, a hypermethylation signature targeting polycomb-repressed chromatin domains was identified in the G1 molecular sub-group with progenitor features.CONCLUSIONS:This study elucidates the diversity of processes remodeling HCC methylomes and reveals the epigenetic and transcriptional impact of driver alterations.

"AbstractOver recent decades, in vitro and in vivo models have significantly advanced brain cancer research; however, each presents distinct challenges for accurately mimicking in situ conditions. In response, organotypic slice cultures have emerged as a promising model recapitulating precisely specific in vivo phenotypes through an ex vivo approach. Ex vivo organotypic brain slice models can integrate biological relevance and patient-specific variability early in drug discovery, thereby aiming for more precise treatment stratification. However, the challenges of obtaining representative fresh brain tissue, ensuring reproducibility, and maintaining essential central nervous system (CNS)-specific conditions reflecting the in situ situation over time have limited the direct application of ex vivo organotypic slice cultures in robust clinical trials. In this review, we explore the benefits and possible limitations of ex vivo organotypic brain slice cultures in neuro-oncological research. Additionally, we share insights from clinical experts in neuro-oncology on how to overcome these current limitations and improve the practical application of organotypic brain slice cultures beyond academic research.","AbstractBackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a strong risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing hospitalization for COVID-19 with VTE.MethodsAdults hospitalized at 21 sites between March 2021 and October 2022 with symptoms of acute respiratory illness were assessed for COVID-19, completion of the original monovalent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination series, and VTE. Prevalence of VTE was compared between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients with COVID-19. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was calculated using a test-negative design. The VE was also stratified by predominant circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant.ResultsAmong 18 811 patients (median age [interquartile range], 63 [50–73] years; 49% women; 59% non-Hispanic white, 20% non-Hispanic black, and 14% Hispanic; and median of 2 comorbid conditions [interquartile range, 1–3]), 9792 were admitted with COVID-19 (44% vaccinated), and 9019 were test-negative controls (73% vaccinated). Among patients with COVID-19, 601 had VTE diagnosed by hospital day 28, of whom 170 were vaccinated. VTE was more common among unvaccinated than vaccinated patients with COVID-19 (7.8% vs 4.0%; P = .001). The VE against COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was 84% overall (95% confidence interval, 80%–87%), and VE stratified by predominant circulating variant was 88% (73%–95%) for Alpha, 93% (90%–95%) for Delta, and 68% (58%–76%) for Omicron variants.ConclusionsVaccination with the original monovalent mRNA series was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE, though data detailing prior history of VTE and use of anticoagulation were not available. These findings will inform risk-benefit considerations for those considering vaccination.",0
"BackgroundCuproptosis, a novel form of cell death mediated by protein lipoylation, is intricately linked to mitochondrial metabolism. However, the clinical association of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in thyroid cancer remains unclear. In this study, we performed a systematic investigation on the differential expression and genetic alterations of CRGs in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and constructed a CRG signature to predict the prognosis of PTC patients.MethodsWe integrated the data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and analyzed the expression of 10 CRGs in PTC. CRG signature was constructed using univariate Cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. In addition, the signature-related molecular features were validated by a combination of functional enrichment, Cox regression, and immune infiltration analysis. Independent validation cohort and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to validate the expression of differentially expressed CRG (CDKN2A).ResultsThyroid cancer patients could be divided into two subtypes (high and low CRG score groups). We found that the overall survival (OS) of patients was lower in the high CRG score group (HCSG) than in the low CRG score group (LCSG) (P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) values for 3 years, 5 years, and 8 years were 0.872, 0.941, and 0.976, respectively. Cox regression analysis indicated that the CRG score could serve as an independent prognostic indicator for PTC. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the CRG prognostic signature was also associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. In HCSG, the immune suppression cell score was significantly higher than in LCSG. In addition, we identified the expression of CRG (CDKN2A) by qRT-PCR, and the results aligned with the TCGA database.ConclusionOur CRG signature demonstrates excellent predictive capabilities for the prognosis of PTC patients. CRGs may play an important role in tumorigenesis and could be used to predict the immunotherapy efficacy of PTC.","PurposeHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a highly deadly malignant tumor with high recurrence and metastasis rates. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in tumor metastasis, recurrence, and resistance to drugs, which have attracted widespread attention in recent years. Research has shown that pseudogenes may regulate stemness to promote the progression of HCC, but its specific mechanisms and impact on prognosis remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, clinical prognosis information of HCC was first downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then we calculated the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) of HCC. We also screened the differentially expressed pseudogene (DEPs) and conducted univariate Cox regression analysis to investigate their effect on the prognosis of HCC. Further, genomic mutation frequency analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to compare the role of pseudogenes and stemness in promoting the progression of HCC. Finally, we conducted the correlation analysis to examine the potential mechanism of pseudogenes regulating stemness to promote the progression of HCC and detected the possible pathways through the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis.ResultsHerein, we revealed that the high stemness of HCC correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. We obtained 31 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated DEPs in HCC and screened CTB-63M22.1, a poor prognostic indicator of HCC. In addition, CTB-63M22.1 had a mutation frequency similar to mRNAsi and acted in a module similar to that of mRNAsi on HCC. We then screened two RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) LIN28B and NOP56 with the highest correlation with stemness. We also discovered that they were primarily enriched in the biological process as examples of mitotic nuclear division and cell cycle.ConclusionsCollectively, these results revealed that pseudogenes CTB-63M22.1 may regulate cancer stemness by regulating RBPs, suggesting that CTB-63M22.1 may serve as an innovative therapeutic target and a reliable prognostic marker for HCC.",1
"PurposeLenvatinib is recommended as a first-line therapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination therapy with local therapy (LT) or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (PI) might improve the antitumor effect of lenvatinib. The objective of this study was to investigate the antitumor effect of lenvatinib-based combination therapies.MethodsThe study retrospectively analyzed 215 HCC patients who received lenvatinib therapy. The outcomes of patients treated with lenvatinib monotherapy as well as combination strategies were compared. Progression-free survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 was the primary endpoint, while PFS by mRECIST, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety were the secondary endpoints. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to overcome the bias of baseline characteristics.ResultsCompared with lenvatinib monotherapy, combination therapy prolonged PFS (by RECIST v1.1, 7.77 vs. 4.43 months, P = 0.045; by mRECIST, 6.97 vs. 5.27 months, P = 0.067). A higher ORR was also recorded in the combined-therapy group, according to both RECIST v1.1 (37 vs. 5%, P < 0.001) and mRECIST (53 vs. 11%, P < 0.001). Similar outcomes were obtained after PSM. Moreover, triple therapy (combined with both PI and LT) was significantly superior to dual therapy (combined with either PI or LT) in terms of better PFS according to RECIST v1.1 (8.90 vs. 6.43 months, P = 0.023). However, adverse events occurred in more patients receiving combined therapy and triple therapy. No difference was observed in OS between groups.ConclusionCombination therapies based on lenvatinib were associated with significantly better PFS and tumor response rates than lenvatinib monotherapy in HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04082-2.","BackgroundGallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare malignant tumour of the bile duct. Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations in the early stage, it is basically at an advanced stage when discovered. Radical resection remains the only curative therapy for patients with GBC. The resection rate is relatively low due to tumour invasion and metastasis, and the overall prognosis is poor. For most patients with unresectable lesions, chemotherapy has been the only recommended treatment for decades. Immunotherapy combined with TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) was proven to be effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Some physicians have attempted to apply immunotherapy and TKIs combined with traditional chemotherapy in patients with advanced GBC. However, the outcomes were not clear because limited cases were reported.Case presentationWe present a case series of four elderly patients with advanced GBC who received tislelizumab and lenvatinib combined with chemotherapy. All four patients responded to this treatment approach. Tumour responses were better in Patient 1 (TMB-H, MSS), Patient 2 (low TMB, MSS), and Patient 3 (low TMB, MSI-H) than in Patient 4 (low TMB, MSS), in whom metastasis occurred during the later stage of treatment.ConclusionThe combination of tislelizumab and lenvatinib may be a promising treatment for patients with advanced GBC. The efficacy and safety need further confirmation.",1
"ABSTRACTMetastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can present with oligometastatic disease and/or develop oligoprogression following systemic therapy. Cytoreductive and focal metastasis-directed therapy options include resection, stereotactic ablative radiation and thermal ablation. Aggressive focal therapy may allow delay in initiation of or modification to systemic therapy and improve clinical outcomes. In this narrative review we synthesize current practice guidelines and prospective data on focal therapy management options and highlight future research. Patient selection and the choice of focal treatment techniques are controversial due to limited and heterogeneous data and patients may benefit from multidisciplinary evaluation. Prospective comparative trials with clearly defined inclusion criteria and relevant end points are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of different approaches.","BackgroundDelivering stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with multiple oligometastases represents a challenge for clinical and technical reasons. We aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with SABR and the impact of tumor volume on survival.Materials and methodsWe included all the patients treated with single course SABR for 3 to 5 extracranial oligometastases. All patients were treated with the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique with ablative intent. End-points of the analysis were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), local control (LC) and toxicity.Results136 patients were treated from 2012 to 2020 on 451 oligometastases. Most common primary tumor was colorectal cancer (44.1%) followed by lung cancer (11.8%). A total of 3, 4 and 5 lesions were simultaneously treated in 102 (75.0%), 26 (19.1%), and 8 (5.9%) patients, respectively. Median total tumor volume (TTV) was 19.1 cc (range 0.6–245.1). With a median follow-up of 25.0 months, OS at 1 and 3 years was 88.4% and 50.2%, respectively. Increasing TTV was independent predictive factor of worse OS (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.18–4.78, p = 0.014) and PFS (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.05–2.54; p = 0.028). Median OS was 80.6 months if tumor volume was ≤ 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 93.6% and 77.5%, respectively), and 31.1 months if TTV was higher than 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 86.7% and 42.3%, respectively). Rates of LC at 1 and 3 years were 89.3% and 76.5%. In terms of toxicity, no grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported both in the acute and late settings.ConclusionWe demonstrated the impact of tumor volume on survival and disease control of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with single course SABR.",1
"Background:There is limited data regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for cN3b patients, who present with both axillary and ipsilateral internal mammary node involvement. We examined trends in the use of SLNB in cN3b patients and survival by axillary procedure for those with nodal pathologic complete response (nPCR).Methods:Adult women with non-metastatic cN3b invasive breast carcinoma between 2012 and 2021 were selected from the National Cancer Database. These patients were compared based on type of axillary surgery, specifically SLNB, SLNB with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and ALND alone. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare overall survival.Results:4,236 patients were included. In 2012, 8.5% of these patients underwent SLNB alone and 18.3% underwent SLNB+ALND. In 2021, this increased to 35.1% for SLNB alone and 23.0% for SLNB with subsequent ALND (p<0.0001). For patients who received NAC, the rate of nPCR was overall found to be 24.9%. Overall survival of patients receiving SLNB or SLNB+ALND with nPCR was not statistically significantly different from the ALND only group with nPCR (p=0.22 and 0.57, respectively).Conclusions:There has been increasing use of the SLNB procedure for patients with cN3b breast cancer over the past decade. In patients with nPCR, SLNB was not associated with reduced survival. For well-selected cN3b patients with an excellent clinical response to NAC including nPCR, axillary de-escalation strategies, such as SLNB with omission of completion axillary dissection, may be considered.","The potential of camel milk-derived exosomes (CMDE) to enhance the bioavailability of Cannabidiol (CBD) was investigated. CBD-CMDE formulation was prepared using an established procedure and its particle size was 138.4 ± 4.37 nm, and CBD entrapment efficiency of 56.56 ± 4.26 %. In-vitro release studies showed release of 78.27 ± 5.37 % and 46.42 ± 4.75 % CBD from CMDE and control CBD formulation respectively in pH 6.8 at 24 hr. The apparent permeability (Papp) of CBD-CMDE was found to be enhanced by 3.95-fold with Papp of 22.9*10−6 ± 0.34 cm/sec as compared to control CBD formulation with Papp of 5.8*10−6 ± 0.65 cm/sec in MDCK cells. CBD-CMDE was found to be more potent than CBD in 2D cytotoxicity assay with IC50 values of 3.6 ± 0.54 μM, 3.88 ± 0.54 μM and 7.53 ± 0.59 μM, 7.53 ± 0.59 μM against Doxorubicin (DOX) resistant MDA-MB-231 and Rapamycin (RM) resistant MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells respectively. Moreover, 3D spheroids assay results demonstrated CBD-CMDE with IC50 values of 14 ± 0.85 μM, 15 ± 0.07 μM as compared to CBD alone with IC50 values of 25 ± 0.93 μM, 34.7 ± 0.08 μM in MDA-MB-231 DOX RT cells and MDA-MB-468 RM RT cells respectively. In-vivo PK studies showed enhanced bioavailability of CBD from CBD-exosomes with AUC(0–24h) of 1350.56 ± 187.50 h.ng/mL as compared to CBD control formulation with AUC(0–24h) of 351.95 ± 39.10 h.ng/mL with a single oral dose of 12 mg/kg. The data indicate that CMDE significantly improved the oral bioavailability of CBD. Overall, CMDE can be used to enhance the oral absorption of poorly bioavailable APIs.",0
"Background:Approximately 30% of cancer patients experience kidney complications, which hinder optimal cancer management, imposing a burden on patients’ quality of life and the healthcare system. The etiology of kidney complications in cancer patients is often attributed to oncological therapies. However, the direct impact of cancer on kidney health is underestimated. Our previous study demonstrated that metastatic lung cancer adversely alters the kidney, and exacerbates chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, indicating lung cancer-kidney crosstalk. The current study examines whether this phenomenon is specific to the employed cancer model.Methods:Female and male mice of various strains were injected with different cell lines of remote organ cancer, and their kidney tissues were analyzed for toxicity and fibrosis.Results:The impact of cancer on the kidney varied by cancer type. Breast cancer and specific subtypes of lung cancer, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant cancer, pathologically altered kidney physiology and function in a manner dependent on the metastatic potential of the cell line. This was independent of mouse strain, sex, and cancer cell line origin. Moreover, tumor DNA was not detected in the renal tissue, excluding metastases to the kidney as a causative factor for the observed pathological alterations. Lewis lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma did not cause nephrotoxicity, regardless of the tumor size.Conclusion:Our results confirm cancer-kidney crosstalk in specific cancer types. In the era of precision medicine, further research is essential to identify at-risk oncology populations, enabling early detection and management of renal complications.NEW & NOTEWORTHYCancer patients frequently experience kidney complications, often attributed to antineoplastic therapies. This emphasis on therapy-induced nephrotoxicity has led to the underestimation of the impact of cancer on the kidney. Our study demonstrates that distant organ cancer is sufficient to induce nephrotoxicity, highlighting the existence of cancer-kidney crosstalk. Our findings underscore a gap in our understanding of renal complications in cancer patients and provide a rationale for identifying the underlying mechanisms for the development of nephroprotective agents.","Mouse models remain at the forefront of immuno-oncology research, providing invaluable insights into the complex interactions between the immune system and developing tumors. While several flow cytometry panels have been developed to study the immunity to cancer in mice, most of them present limitations in their capacity to address the complexity of anti-cancer immune responses. For example, many of the panels developed to date focus on a restricted number of leukocyte populations (notably, T cells or antigen-presenting cells), failing to include the multitude of other subsets that participate in anti-cancer immunity. In addition, these panels were developed using blood or splenic leukocytes. While the immune composition of the blood or spleen can provide information on systemic immune responses to cancer, it is in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that local immunity takes place. Therefore, we optimized this spectral flow cytometry panel for identifying the chief cell types that take part in immunity to cancer using immune cells from cancer tissue. We used pancreatic tumors implanted both orthotopically and subcutaneously to demonstrate the panel’s flexibility and suitability in diverse mouse models. The panel was also validated in peripheral immune districts (namely, the blood, spleen, and liver of tumor-harboring mice) to allow comparisons between local and systemic anti-tumor immunity.Basic Protocol 1: Tumor induction – OrthotopicAlternate Protocol 1: Tumor induction – SubcutaneousBasic Protocol 2: Preparation of single cell suspensions from the tumor, spleen, liver, and blood of tumor-bearing miceAlternate Protocol 2: Staining single cell suspensions from the tumor, spleen, liver, and blood of tumor-bearing mice",1
"Cadmium is a well-known toxic heavy metal that poses significant health risks, particularly through inhalation, smoking, and the consumption of contaminated food. Exposure to cadmium is linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the systemic effects of intratracheal cadmium chloride (0.5 mg/kg) instillation in C57BL/6 mice. All parameters, including inflammation assessment, lung function evaluation (using Flexi-vent), and immunophenotyping of T-cells in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes), were analyzed 14 days after Cd exposure. The results demonstrated that cadmium exposure led to significant immune cell infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, altered pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and was associated with impaired lung function, characterized by increased lung resistance and Newtonian resistance. Analysis of T-cell populations revealed no significant changes in total T-cells in mediastinal lymph nodes and spleen, but a decrease in CD4+ T-cells and an increase in CD8+ T-cells were observed. These findings suggest that cadmium disrupts T-cell homeostasis in secondary lymphoid organs. Further research is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced lung injury and immune dysregulation, essential for developing effective therapeutic interventions against chronic lung diseases caused by cadmium exposure.","P2 purinergic receptor expression is dysregulated in multiple cancer subtypes and is associated with worse outcomes. Studies identify roles for P2 purinergic receptors in tumor cells that drive disease aggressiveness. There is also sufficient evidence that P2 purinergic receptor expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for disease initiation and progression. Immune cells constitute a significant component of the TME and display both tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic potential. Studies pre-dating the investigation of P2 purinergic receptors in cancer identify P2 receptor expression on multiple immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, T-cells, and dendritic cells; all of which are implicated in tumor initiation, tumor promotion, or response to treatment. Herein, we discuss P2 purinergic receptor expression and function in tumor-related immune cells. We provide a rationale for further investigations of P2 purinergic receptors within the TME to better define the mechanistic pathways of inflammation-mediate tumorigenesis and explore P2 purinergic receptors as potential targets for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.",1
"Small intestinal metastasis is extremely rare and only 13 cases have been reported till date and almost all such patients have presented with intestinal obstruction. The 5-year overall survival for metastatic esophageal cancer is as low as 5% while the patients with small intestinal metastasis have a median survival of only 3 months (range 1–12 months) despite undergoing radical resection of the small bowel. We present a case of a male in his 50’s who presented with difficulty in swallowing for 4 months. On evaluation, he was found to have squamous cell carcinoma in the mid thoracic esophagus. He underwent radical chemo-radiation up to 60 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. One week after completion of treatment he presented with ileal obstruction and omental nodules and surgical resection and evaluation of the respective ileal segment and omental biopsy revealed a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. The patient expired 3 months post-surgery. Carcinoma esophagus with small bowel metastasis has a very grave prognosis that patients rarely survive beyond 1 year despite undergoing resection. Hence it is imperative to consider a small bowel metastasis when such patients present with clinical features of intestinal obstruction for early diagnosis and aggressive management.","Neuroendocrine tumors account for 0.5% of all malignancies, and their incidence is around 2/100,000 with a female predilection within the age range of 50 years at the time of presentation. NETs in India have a different clinicopathological profile compared to those in Western countries. Very few limited studies are available in Indian literature with regard to the epidemiology, presentations, histopathological characteristics, and treatment outcomes in patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors. This warrants the need for documentation of these tumors, and we hereby present a case series of four patients diagnosed with NETs who presented within a period of 9 months at our rural tertiary care center.",0
"Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is a novel chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer. Although rashes are reported as a common adverse event from this therapy, a paucity of literature is available on dermatologic toxicities to EV, especially with respect to bullous dermatoses. This case report will review a unique bullous dermatosis in the setting of EV therapy, including the diagnostic workup and management. Because cutaneous adverse events to chemotherapy and immunotherapy are common and can often result in dose reduction and treatment withdrawal for cancer patients, awareness of these manifestations and understanding how to manage them is crucial to providing quality care to this patient population.","PurposeCancer vaccine (CV) has thrived as a promising tool for cancer prevention and treatment. However, how to maintain the integrity and diversity of individualized vaccine antigens and activate the adaptive immune system is still challenging.MethodsHerein, a preventive and therapeutic vaccine platform for in situ effective multi-model synergistic therapy is developed. In our study, we process B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen (LNF) to obtain LNF cells, the characterization of LNF cells were conducted. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect and immune activation ability were studied, and the role as a CV were investigated.ResultsThe LNF cells preserve intact cellular structure and tumor-associated self-antigen gp100. Moreover, LNF cells have the ability of loading and releasing doxorubicin (DOX). Except for the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy brought by DOX, the LNF cells can promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and induce immune response by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly with the existence of adjuvant, R848. Specifically, the CD8+ T cells of mice in LNF-DOX/R848 group are 6 times of that in PBS group in tumor microenvironment, and twice in spleen. Therefore, LNF cells can also be utilized as a CV. Vaccination with LNF/R848 cells effectively suppress the tumor growth in mice by fivefold as compared to the control group.ConclusionIn this work, we obtain the LNF cells with a simple procedure. The LNF cells not only provides a tumor cells-based multi-modal system for cancer therapy but inspires new insights into future development of individualized CVs strategies.Graphical AbstractThis study processes live B16F10 cells by liquid nitrogen frozen to obtain LNF cells, which preserve cell integrity and homologous targeting ability. The LNF cells can load and deliver drug and can serve as tumor vaccine. Results demonstrated the LNF cells have effective prophylactic ability, and ideal anti-tumor ability with the loaded drug and adjuvant.

"Purpose:Despite family history being an established risk factor for prostate cancer, the role of a broader definition of family history inclusive of not just prostate cancer but other genetically related malignancies has not been investigated in the active surveillance population. Here, we evaluate the impact of an expanded definition of family history on active surveillance outcomes.Materials and Methods:Patients undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1997-2019 with detailed data available on family cancer history were identified. Primary outcome was biopsy progression-free survival, and secondary outcomes were treatment-free survival, adverse pathological features at prostatectomy, and biochemical recurrence after treatment. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.Results:Among 855 evaluable patients, 300 (35.1%) patients had any family history of prostate cancer, and 95 (11.1%) had a family history of related malignancies suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome. Family history of prostate cancer alone was not associated with biopsy progression, whereas family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome was associated with a significantly increased risk of biopsy progression (HR 1.43, 95%CI 1.01-2.02), independent of other known clinicopathological risk factors in multivariable analysis. Similarly, family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome was associated with significantly lower treatment-free survival (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.14-2.18) in multivariable analysis. No significant association was found between family history and adverse features on surgical pathology or biochemical recurrence.Conclusions:An expanded family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome is an independent predictor of biopsy progression during active surveillance. Men with such a family history may still be offered active surveillance but should be counseled regarding the higher risk of disease progression.","Purpose:Less invasive decision support tools are desperately needed to identify occult high-risk disease in men with prostate cancer (PCa) on active surveillance (AS). For a variety of reasons, many men on AS with low- or intermediate-risk disease forgo the necessary repeat surveillance biopsies needed to identify potentially higher-risk PCa. Here, we describe the development of a blood-based immunocyte transcriptomic signature to identify men harboring occult aggressive PCa. We then validate it on a biopsy-positive population with the goal of identifying men who should not be on AS and confirm those men with indolent disease who can safely remain on AS. This model uses subtraction-normalized immunocyte transcriptomic profiles to risk-stratify men with PCa who could be candidates for AS.Materials and Methods:Men were eligible for enrollment in the study if they were determined by their physician to have a risk profile that warranted prostate biopsy. Both training (n = 1017) and validation cohort (n = 1198) populations had blood samples drawn coincident to their prostate biopsy. Purified CD2+ and CD14+ immune cells were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and RNA was extracted and sequenced. To avoid overfitting and unnecessary complexity, a regularized regression model was built on the training cohort to predict PCa aggressiveness based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network PCa guidelines. This model was then validated on an independent cohort of biopsy-positive men only, using National Comprehensive Cancer Network unfavorable intermediate risk and worse as an aggressiveness outcome, identifying patients who were not appropriate for AS.Results:The best final model for the AS setting was obtained by combining an immunocyte transcriptomic profile based on 2 cell types with PSA density and age, reaching an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.69-0.77). The model significantly outperforms (P < .001) PSA density as a biomarker, which has an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.65-0.73). This model yields an individualized patient risk score with 90% negative predictive value and 50% positive predictive value.Conclusions:While further validation in an intended-use cohort is needed, the immunocyte transcriptomic model offers a promising tool for risk stratification of individual patients who are being considered for AS.",1
"AbstractBackgroundBiliary tract cancer (BTC) is an aggressive biliary tract cancer, arising from the bile ducts and gallbladder, with a poor prognosis. The TOPAZ-1 trial of durvalumab plus first-line chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) showed improved survival vs chemotherapy alone. This real-world study aimed to confirm the effectiveness of this regimen.MethodsThis retrospective, multicenter study included patients with advanced BTC treated with first-line durvalumab plus platinum chemotherapy at the Linkou, Taoyuan, and Tucheng branches of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital as well as at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between August 2021 and June 2023.ResultsAmong the 45 patients with advanced biliary tree cancer treated with durvalumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine as first-line treatment, the objective response rate was 31.1% (14 partial responses). An additional 40% (18 patients) had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95%CI, 4.4-6.9) and median overall survival was 15.8 months (95%CI, 7.9-23.8). Responders had significantly longer survival than non-responders (15.8 vs 3.3 months). Although higher durvalumab doses (1000-1500 mg) appeared to have improved efficacy compared to lower doses (<1000 mg), the difference was not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, poor ECOG performance status (≥2) and a high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio were independent prognostic factors for shorter overall survival.ConclusionThis real-world study demonstrated the comparable efficacy of durvalumab plus chemotherapy to the TOPAZ-1 trial for patients with advanced BTC and identified prognostic factors. There was a trend toward improved efficacy with higher durvalumab dosing (1000-1500 mg) vs lower dosing, though further research is needed to confirm this relationship.","The pathogenesis of cancer and cardiovascular diseases is subjected to spatiotemporal regulation by the tissue microenvironment. Multiplex visualization of the microenvironmental components, including immune cells, vasculature and tissue hypoxia, provides critical information underlying the disease progression and therapy resistance, which is often limited by imaging depth and resolution in large-volume tissues. To this end, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, following tissue clarification and immunostaining, may generate three-dimensional high-resolution images at a whole-organ level. Here we provide a detailed description of light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging analysis of immune cell composition, vascularization, tissue perfusion and hypoxia in mouse normal brains and hearts, as well as brain tumors. We describe a procedure for visualizing tissue vascularization, perfusion and hypoxia with a transgenic vascular labeling system. We provide the procedures for tissue collection, tissue semi-clearing and immunostaining. We further describe standard methods for analyzing tissue immunity and vascularity. We anticipate that this method will facilitate the spatial illustration of structure and function of the tissue microenvironmental components in cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The procedure requires 1–2 weeks and can be performed by users with expertise in general molecular biology.",0
"Introduction:Glioblastoma patients have a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and systemic immunosuppression that comprise a major barrier to immune checkpoint therapy. Based on the production of endocannabinoids by glioblastomas, we explored involvement of endocannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), encoded by the CNR2 gene, which is predominantly expressed by immune cells, in glioblastoma-related immunosuppression.Materials & Methods:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases was used to correlate enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, as well as CB2Rs, with patient overall survival. Intrastriatal administration of luciferase-expressing, murine GL261 glioblastoma cells was used to establish in in vivo glioblastoma model for characterization of tumor growth and intratumoral immune cell infiltration, as well as provide immune cells for in vitro co-culture experiments. Involvement of CB2Rs was determined by treatment with CB2R agonist (GW405833) or CB2R antagonist (AM630). ELISA, FACS, and immunocytochemistry were used to determine perforin, granzyme B, and surface marker levels.Results:Bioinformatics of human glioblastoma databases showed high expression of CB2R and elevated endocannabinoid production correlated with poorer prognosis, and involved immune-associated pathways. AM630treatment of GL261 glioblastoma-bearing mice induced a potent antitumor response, with survival plateauing at 50% on Day 40, when all control mice (median survival 28 days) and mice treated with GW405833 (median survival 21 days) had died. Luciferase tumor imaging revealed accelerated tumor growth by GW405833 treatment, but stable or regressing tumors in AM630-treated mice. Notably, in spleens, AM630 treatment caused an 83% decrease in monocytes/macrophages, and 1.8- and 1.6-fold increases in CD8+ and CD4+ cells, respectively. Within tumors, there was a corresponding decrease in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increase in CD8+ T cells. In vitro, lymphocytes from AM630-treated mice showed greater cytotoxic function (increased percentage of perforin- and granzyme B-positive CD8+ T cells).Discussion:These results suggest that inhibition of CB2R enhances both immunosuppressive TAM infiltration and systemic T-cell suppression through CB2R activation, and that inhibition of CB2Rs can potently counter both the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, as well as systemic immunosuppression in glioblastoma.","Local and systemic immunosuppression are prominent features of pancreatic cancer, rendering anti-tumor effector cells inactive and immunotherapeutic approaches ineffective. The spleen, an understudied point of antigen-presentation and T cell priming in humans, holds particular importance in pancreatic cancer due to its proximity to the developing tumor. As main effectors of antigen presentation, dendritic cells display antigens to lymphocytes, thereby bridging the innate and adaptive immune response. While tumor-infiltrating anti-inflammatory dendritic cells have been described, splenic dendritic cells have historically just been considered to stimulate the anti-tumor immune response. Here, we describe, for the first time, the presence of an immunosuppressive, tolerogenic IDO1+ dendritic cell subset in the spleens of pancreatic cancer patients that likely contributes to systemic immunosuppression that is associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Network analysis of scRNA seq data reveals extensive communication networks between the identified tolerogenic DC cluster and numerous immune cell populations in the spleen. Interactions with innate and adaptive immune cells suggest a broad influence on leukocyte trafficking and immune regulation within the spleen microenvironment. The identification of signaling pathways involving AHR and IDO-1, CCL19, NECTIN2, CLEC2D, and others elucidates potential mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive functions of this cell type.",1
"AbstractCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has emerged as a valuable liquid biopsy source for glioma biomarker discovery and validation. CSF produced within the ventricles circulates through the subarachnoid space, where the composition of glioma-derived analytes is influenced by the proximity and anatomical location of sampling relative to tumor, in addition to underlying tumor biology. The substantial gradients observed between lumbar and intracranial CSF compartments for tumor-derived analytes underscore the importance of sampling site selection. Moreover, radiographic features, such as tumor-CSF contact and blood-brain barrier disruption, are critical covariates that may affect biomarker detection and the abundance of plasma-derived analytes in CSF, respectively. Longitudinal intracranial CSF sampling, enabled by access devices like Ommaya reservoirs, may offer a window into treatment response and disease progression, though variability in analyte yield, sample volumes, and the dynamic effects of surgical resection pose challenges. This review critically evaluates the anatomic, radiographic, and longitudinal factors, or “time-space continuum,” that impact glioma CSF biomarker abundance. Practical considerations for longitudinal CSF biobanking, including access device placement and collection, are also reviewed. Key takeaways and recommendations for CSF glioma biomarker discovery and validation are provided as a “hitchhiker’s guide” based on our collective experience, along with resources for investigators aiming to develop CSF biobanking at their institutions.","AbstractBackgroundThe generation of patient avatars is critically needed in neuro-oncology for treatment prediction and preclinical therapeutic development. Our objective was to develop a fast, reproducible, low-cost, and easy-to-use method of tumoroids generation and analysis, efficient for all types of brain tumors, primary and metastatic.MethodsTumoroids were generated from 89 patients: 81 primary tumors including 77 gliomas, and 8 brain metastases. Tumoroids morphology and cellular and molecular characteristics were compared with the ones of the parental tumor by using histology, methylome profiling, pTERT mutations, and multiplexed spatial immunofluorescences. Their cellular stability over time was validated by flow cytometry. Therapeutic sensitivity was evaluated and predictive factors of tumoroid generation were analyzed.ResultsAll the tumoroids analyzed had similar histological (n = 21) and molecular features (n = 7) to the parental tumor. The median generation time was 5 days. The success rate was 65 %: it was higher for high-grade gliomas and brain metastases versus IDH mutated low-grade gliomas. For high-grade gliomas, neither other clinical, neuro-imaging, histological nor molecular factors were predictive of tumoroid generation success. The cellular organization inside tumoroids analyzed by MACSima revealed territories dedicated to specific cell subtypes. Finally, we showed the correlation between tumoroid and patient treatment responses to radio-chemotherapy and their ability to respond to immunotherapy thanks to a dedicated and reproducible 3D analysis workflow.ConclusionsPatient-derived tumoroid model that we developed offers a robust, user-friendly, low-cost, and reproducible preclinical model valuable for therapeutic development of all types of primary or metastatic brain tumors, allowing their integration into forthcoming early-phase clinical trials.",1
"Mathematical modeling has made significant contributions to drug design, development, and optimization. Virtual clinical trials that integrate mathematical models to explore patient heterogeneity and its impact on a variety of therapeutic questions have recently risen in popularity. Here, we outline best practices for creating virtual patients from mathematical models to ultimately implement and execute a virtual clinical trial. In this practical guide, we discuss and provide examples of model design, parameter estimation, parameter sensitivity, model identifiability, and virtual patient cohort creation. Our goal is to help researchers adopt these approaches to further the use of virtual population-based analysis and virtual clinical trials.","Stabilization of cereblon (CRBN)/neosubstrate complexes with molecular glues followed by degradation of those neosubstrates is an emerging strategy in drug discovery with compelling potential to target certain proteins that were previously considered to be undruggable. In this context, the discovery of novel CRBN ligands is an important area of ongoing research that holds promise to expand the scope of proteins that can be targeted through this mode of action. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of CRBN ligands featuring heteroaryl glutarimide and dihydrouracil scaffolds. We identified a subset of heteroaryl glutarimides exhibiting potent CRBN binding and increased chemical stability in cell culture media compared with traditional immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). This indicates that the scaffolds described herein could become useful starting points for the discovery of novel molecular glue degraders.",0
"A larger percentage of our population is aging healthily and living on to a ripe old age. 60 years of age is taken as cut-off for identifying geriatric population for the purpose of specialized healthcare. The incidence of cancer is increasing and its expected more so in the geriatric population. At present , there are a limited cancer centres where specialized geriatric clinic is being conducted.Some of the the key unmet needs are — lack of resources and time for dedicated geriatric screening, lack of validated interventions and lack of awareness about the field of geriatric oncology. Some of the proposed solutions are increasing orientation and exposure of trainees and early career oncologists as well as carrying out country specific research to find useful interventions in this field.","AbstractBACKGROUNDThe inherent resistance of glioma including the recent failure of immune checkpoint blockade to prolong survival in glioma has partly been attributed to tumor heterogeneity leading to insufficient drug availability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the main clinical modality to monitor tumor growth and treatment response but cannot assess drug availability within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To this end, we developed a platform to assess blood-brain barrier disruption utilizing high field multiparametric MRI and correlative light sheet microscopy (LSM) to investigate the underlying mechanisms of response and resistance towards immunotherapy in brain tumor models. MATERIAL AND METHODSOrthotopic gliomas were grown in the syngeneic GL261 or SB28 mouse glioma models. Longitudinal contrast enhanced multiparametric MRI was performed weekly after baseline. To correlate drug distribution with BBB-D and the microvasculature, mice either received a single dose of fluorescently labelled anti-PD1 or TLR7 agonist encapsulated nanoparticle CDNP-R848 at different tumor stages. After 24 hours circulation time, vasculature was labelled through lectin-FITC perfusion. Brains were cleared with fDisco and LSM was performed. Images were segmented with Ilastik and further analysis was carried out in Imaris, Fiji and VesselVio. RESULTSIn Gl261 gliomas we achieved a response rate of 87.5% to CDNP-R848, as previously established by our group, whereas SB28 tumors were fully resistant to CDNP-R848 validating the strong immunotherapeutic resistance of SB28. In both glioma models, immunotherapies were CNS-penetrant and reached the TME without off targeting, while showing cellular specificity for myeloid cells or T cells, respectively. Gadofluorine M and Gd-DOTA allowed the assessment of different spatio-temporal patterns of BBB-D. Microbleedings as assessed by T2* imaging and BBB-D as assessed by perfusion imaging were more prominent in SB28, indicating pronounced heterogeneity in the SB28 model, likely contributing to its resistance. GfM and perfusion MRI were strongly correlated with drug distribution, indicating that these MR parameters can predict drug distribution in the TME. CONCLUSIONOur correlated MR-LSM approach therefore allows the assessment of the 3-dimensional biodistribution of checkpoint inhibitors and immunotherapeutic NP in the TME in relation to BBB-D. By validating MR-based imaging biomarkers, we aim to non-invasively predict drug availability in the complex TME of glioma.",0
"BackgroundNeoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) using the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) protocol has improved esophageal cancer outcomes. This study reports the real-world experience of the CROSS regimen for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) regarding its feasibility, safety, and predictors of treatment completion from an Indian tertiary center.MethodologyA retrospective review was conducted for patients with ESCC receiving CROSS (radiation dose: 41.4 Gy) or a modified CROSS (mCROSS; radiation dose: 45 Gy) protocol NACRT between 2015 and 2022. We studied the treatment tolerability, factors predicting NACRT completion, and the effect of completion of its chemotherapy component on the pathological outcomes.Results Of the109 patients (68.8% males; mean age, 56 ± 9 years; Charlson's comorbidity index [CCI] >2, 19.3%; stage III–IVA, 58%; mean tumor length, 5.5 ± 2.1cm; CROSS, 70.6%; mCROSS, 29.4%), all except 4 completed radiotherapy but only 58 (53.2%) patients completed ≥4 cycles of chemotherapy. Forty-nine patients belonged to the “extended” CROSS trial inclusion criteria. Among the 60 patients who fulfilled the CROSS inclusion criteria, only 51.7% were able to complete ≥4 chemotherapy cycles. The commonest reason for noncompletion of chemotherapy was the occurrence of neutropenia (60.8%). Pretreatment hemoglobin (≥12 vs. <12 g%; odds ratio [OR]: 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–6.96; p = 0.031), a low CCI (≤2 vs. >2; OR: 2.98; 95% CI: 1.02–8.73; p = 0.047), and radiation therapy techniques (conformal vs. conventional; OR: 3.29; 95% CI: 1.14–9.50; p = 0.028) were associated with completion of chemotherapy (≥4 cycles). Although there was a trend toward improved R0 resection (95.7 vs. 91.4%), reduced node positivity (17.0 vs. 31.4%), and a high pCR (57.4 vs. 48.6%) in patients completing chemotherapy (≥4 cycles) compared with those not completing chemotherapy (<4 cycles), these differences were statistically nonsignificant. ConclusionIn this study, ESCC patients receiving the CROSS protocol NACRT could complete their radiotherapy component, but a significant proportion exhibited poor chemotherapy tolerance. Neutropenia was a major factor limiting chemotherapy delivery, but anemia, high CCI, and conventional radiation techniques were also associated with noncompletion of chemotherapy. The omission of a few chemotherapy cycles had no significant effect on the pathological response; however, its impact on cancer survival requires further evaluation.","Determining binding affinity (KD) is an important aspect of the characterization of radiolabeled antibodies (rAb). Typically, binding affinity is represented by the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, and can be calculated as the concentration of antibody at which half the antibody binding sites are occupied at equilibrium. This method can be generalized to any radiolabeled antibody or other protein and peptide scaffolds. In contrast to cell-based methods, the choice of immobilized antigens is particularly useful for validating binding affinities after long-term storage of antibodies, distinguishing binding affinities of fragment antigen-binding region (Fab) arms in bispecific antibody constructs, and determining if there is variability in antigen expression between different cell lines. This method involves immobilizing a fixed amount of antigen to specified wells on a breakable 96-well plate. Then, nonspecific binding was blocked in all wells with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Subsequently, the rAb was added in a concentration gradient to all wells. A range of concentrations was chosen to allow the rAb to reach saturation, that is, a concentration of antibody at which all antigens are continuously bound by the rAb. In designated wells without immobilized antigen, nonspecific binding of the rAb can be determined. By subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding in the wells with immobilized antigen, specific binding of the rAb to the antigen can be determined. The KD of the rAb was calculated from the resulting saturation binding curve. As an example, binding affinity was determined using radiolabeled amivantamab, a bispecific antibody for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytoplasmic mesenchymal-epithelial transition (cMET) proteins.",0
"AbstractBackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review synthesises all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making. It updates the previous version of the review, published in 2018.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both on overall survival, severe or life‐threatening adverse events, and quality of life in people undergoing first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.Search methodsWe searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CANCERLIT, and handsearched various sources for additional studies. The latest search dates were in March and July 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both with another intervention or best supportive care. Participants were required to have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer not amenable to curative intent treatment. Histological confirmation was required. Trials were required to report overall survival.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.Main resultsWe included 75 studies in the review and 51 in the meta‐analysis (11,333 participants). We divided the studies into seven categories: any anti‐cancer treatment versus best supportive care; various chemotherapy types versus gemcitabine; gemcitabine‐based combinations versus gemcitabine alone; various chemotherapy combinations versus gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel; fluoropyrimidine‐based studies; miscellaneous studies; and radiotherapy studies. In general, the included studies were at low risk for random sequence generation, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias, at unclear risk for allocation concealment, and high risk for performance bias.Compared to best supportive care, chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.33; absolute risk of death at 12 months of 971 per 1000 versus 962 per 1000; 4 studies, 298 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The adverse effects of chemotherapy and impacts on quality of life (QoL) were uncertain. Many of the chemotherapy regimens were outdated.Eight studies compared non‐gemcitabine‐based chemotherapy regimens to gemcitabine. These showed that 5‐fluorouracil (5FU) likely reduces OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27; risk of death at 12 months of 914 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 1 study, 126 participants; moderate certainty), and grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). Fixed dose rate gemcitabine likely improves OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; risk of death at 12 months of 683 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 644 participants; moderate certainty), and likely increase grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). FOLFIRINOX improves OS (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60; risk of death at 12 months of 524 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 652 participants; high certainty), and delays deterioration in QoL, but increases grade 3/4 adverse events.Twenty‐eight studies compared gemcitabine‐based combinations to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine plus platinum may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; risk of death at 12 months of 745 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 6 studies, 1140 participants; low certainty), may increase grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely worsens QoL. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improves OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; risk of death at 12 months of 722 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 10 studies, 2718 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely improves QoL. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitors result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; risk of death at 12 months of 770 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 3 studies, 839 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely does not alter QoL. Gemcitabine plus taxane result in a large improvement in OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; risk of death at 12 months of 644 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 986 participants; high certainty), and likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events and improves QoL.Nine studies compared chemotherapy combinations to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combination regimens improve OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; risk of death at 12 months of 542 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 6 studies, 1285 participants; high certainty). The treatment arms had distinct toxicity profiles, and there was little to no difference in QoL. Alternative schedules of gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel likely result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.47; risk of death at 12 months of 663 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 2 studies, 367 participants; moderate certainty) or QoL, but may increase grade 3/4 adverse events.Four studies compared fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations to fluoropyrimidines alone, with poor quality evidence. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations are likely to result in little to no impact on OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.15; risk of death at 12 months of 765 per 1000 versus 704 per 1000; P = 0.27; 4 studies, 491 participants; moderate certainty) versus fluoropyrimidines alone. The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in grade 3/4 adverse events or QoL between the two groups.We included only one radiotherapy (iodine‐125 brachytherapy) study with 165 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of radiotherapy on outcomes.Authors' conclusionsCombination chemotherapy remains standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus a taxane improve OS compared to gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that fluoropyrimidine‐based combination chemotherapy regimens improve OS compared to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. The effects of radiotherapy were uncertain as only one low‐quality trial was included. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individuals still remains unpersonalised, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to assist in rationalising treatment selection for patients.","AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.",1
"PurposeWe aimed to investigate whether induction chemotherapy with less than four courses is as effective as induction chemotherapy with more than four courses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy.MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 249 patients with NSCLC who received chemoimmunotherapy at 12 centers in Japan between January and December 2019. The patient group that completed less than four courses owing to adverse events (AEs), and received subsequent maintenance therapy was compared to the group that received at least four courses of induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsOn univariate and multivariate analyses, the patient group that transitioned to maintenance therapy after completing less than four courses of induction chemotherapy had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those who completed at least four courses (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.38–3.37, p < 0.001 and HR 2.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.40–3.84, p = 0.001, respectively). There was no obvious difference in PFS between the group in which induction chemotherapy ended in two or three courses leading to partial or complete response, and the group that continued at least four courses of induction chemotherapy (log-rank test p = 0.53).ConclusionTreatment efficacy may be maintained if induction chemotherapy is completed in less than four courses owing to development of AEs, and is administered for more than two courses with partial or complete response; efficacy is maintained even on transitioning to maintenance therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03782-5.","BackgroundWe evaluate outcomes of SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinomas in the largest single-institution study.MethodsRetrospective cross-sectional study of patients with SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma between 1998 and 2024. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free probability (RFP) at 1 and 5 years were measured by Kaplan-Meier method.ResultsThere were 47 patients with a median age of 53. Initial pathological diagnosis was altered in 33%. Twelve (34%) patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with one partial response. Curative surgical approach was undertaken in 73%. Definitive chemoradiation was administered in 20%. DSS at 1 and 5 years was 93% and 45%, respectively. RFP at 1 and 5 years was 73% and 33%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, cranial nerve involvement (p=0.01 for DSS) remained significantly worse for DSS and overall survival.ConclusionsSMARCB1-deficient tumors had limited response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cranial nerve involvement was associated with worse prognosis. Optimal treatment is unclear. Surgery should be offered to patients with resectable disease.",1
"PurposeOlder patients with cancer are underrepresented in pivotal trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This study aimed to investigate immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that occur in older patients with lung cancer treated with ICIs, and explore predictors of the occurrence of irAEs.MethodsA prospective analysis was performed on older patients with lung cancer aged ≥ 65 years who were treated with anti-programmed cell death-1/-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors in Beijing Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. The incidence and risk factors of irAEs were estimated by the Chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The predictive power of Geriatric-8 (G-8) for irAEs was tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Lymphocyte counts were measured by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels were tested by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculated progression-free survival (PFS) curves, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences.ResultsA total of 201 older patients aged ≥ 65 years with lung cancer were enrolled in this study. The most common irAEs were interstitial pneumonia, dermatological toxicity and hypothyroidism, with rates of 17.2%, 16.1% and 5.6%, respectively. ROC showed that G-8 could predict the occurrence of irAEs in patients aged 65–71 years (≥ G2 irAEs: AUC = 0.757, p < 0.001; ≥ G3 irAEs: AUC = 0.862, p < 0.001), but not for patients aged ≥ 71 years. NLR, LMR, PNI, hypertension and diabetes were associated with irAEs. Lower CD4 + T cells and B cells, and lower levels of IL-10 were associated with the development of irAEs.ConclusionOur study confirmed the accuracy of G-8 for predicting irAEs in older patients. We also identified several predictors of irAEs in older patients with lung cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04792-1.","AbstractCentral to immune recognition is the glycocalyx, a glycan-rich coat on all cells that plays a crucial role in interactions that enable pathogen detection and activation of immune defenses. Pathogens and cancerous cells often display distinct glycans on their surfaces, making these saccharide antigens prime targets for vaccine development. However, carbohydrates alone generally serve as poor immunogens due to their often weak binding affinities, inability to effectively recruit T cell help, and reliance on adjuvants to iboost immune activation. The introduction of glycoconjugate vaccines, initially involving the covalent coupling of carbohydrate antigens to carrier proteins, marked a pivotal advancement by facilitating neutralizing antibody production against carbohydrate targets. Despite successes in generating glycoconjugate vaccines against certain bacterial diseases, challenges persist in creating effective vaccines against numerous intracellular pathogens and non-communicable diseases such as cancer. In this review, we highlight new developments in conjugate vaccine platforms aim to overcome these limitations by optimizing the display of glycan and T cell epitopes as well as incorporating defined carbohydrate adjuvants to direct tailored immune responses. These advancements promise to improve the effectiveness of carbohydrate-based vaccines and broaden their coverage against a wide range of diseases.",0
"mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are an emerging therapy validated for COVID-19 and are being evaluated to treat other diseases. However, a major limitation remains: achieving extrahepatic mRNA expression. The development of new carriers could alter biodistribution to therapeutic organs, thus expanding the utility of mRNA-based medicines. In this study we use a combination of chemostatistically-guided material synthesis and design of experiment optimization for the development of a spleen expressing lipid nanoparticle (SE-LNP). We begin with synthesis of a novel cholesterol derivative followed by SE-LNP formulation and design of experiment guided optimization to identify three lead SE-LNPs. We then evaluate their in vitro delivery mechanism, and in vivo biodistribution and protein expression in mice, ultimately achieving spleen-preferential expression. The goal of this paper is to create LNPs that preferentially deliver mRNA to the spleen upon intravenous delivery, demonstrating lipid nanoparticles’ potential to modulate gene expression in extrahepatic tissues for disease treatment.","ABSTRACTThe crosstalk between the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumour cells promote immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy in gastrointestinal (GI) tumours. Post-transcriptional regulation of genes is pivotal to GI tumours progression, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) serve as key regulators via their RNA-binding domains. RBPs may exhibit either anti-tumour or pro-tumour functions by influencing the TIME through the modulation of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs expression, as well as post-transcriptional modifications, primarily N6-methyladenosine (m6A). Aberrant regulation of RBPs, such as HuR and YBX1, typically enhances tumour immune escape and impacts prognosis of GI tumour patients. Further, while targeting RBPs offers a promising strategy for improving immunotherapy in GI cancers, the mechanisms by which RBPs regulate the TIME in these tumours remain poorly understood, and the therapeutic application is still in its early stages. This review summarizes current advances in exploring the roles of RBPs in regulating genes expression and their effect on the TIME of GI tumours, then providing theoretical insights for RBP-targeted cancer therapies.",0
"PurposeTo investigate the relationship between the microlymphangiogenesis, microangiogenesis, and combined detection of the programmed cell death-1 protein (PD-1)/ki67 in patients with gastric cancer as well as the disease prognosis.MethodsImmunohistochemistry was used to detect the microlymphatic density (MLD) and microvessel density (MVD) in the central and peripheral zones in 92 cases of gastric cancer, along with the number of PD-1- and ki67-positive tumor cells.ResultsThe central zone of the gastric cancer tissue contained fewer atretic cord-like lymphatic vessels than the peripheral zone, while the peripheral zone contained an increased number of lymphatic vessels compared with the central zone. In most cases, the lumen was also dilated. Compared with the MLD in the peripheral zone, the MLD in central zone was significantly decreased. Compared with the number of PD-1-positive cells in the peripheral zone, the number of PD-1-positive cells in the central zone was significantly decreased, and compared with the number of ki67-positive cells in the peripheral zone. The differences in the microlymphangiogenesis, microangiogenesis, and the number of PD-1- and ki67-positive cells among the different histological types were not statistically significant. The microlymphangiogenesis, microangiogenesis, and PD-1- and ki67-positive cells were significantly decreased in the gastric cancer tissues from the patients in stages T1 and T2 compared with the gastric cancer tissues from the patients in stages T3 and T4.ConclusionsThe detection of the MLD and MVD as well as the positive expression of PD-1 and ki67 in gastric cancer tissue are important reference indicators for judging the prognosis of gastric cancer.","BackgroundThere are limited studies on the association between angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) and the predictive risk of melanoma, even though angiogenic factors, which are essential for tumor growth and metastasis, might be secreted by angiogenesis-related protein in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). To forecast patient outcomes, this study attempts to develop a predictive risk signature linked to angiogenesis in cutaneous melanoma.MethodsIn 650 patients with SKCM, the expression and mutation of ARGs were examined, and this information was related to the clinical prognosis. SKCM patients were split into two groups based on how well they performed on the ARG. The link between ARGs, risk genes, and immunological microenvironment was examined using a range of algorithmic analysis techniques. Based on these five risk genes, an angiogenesis risk signature was created. We developed a nomogram and examined the sensitivity of antineoplastic medications to help the proposed risk model's clinical applicability.ResultsThe risk model developed by ARGs revealed that the prognosis for the two groups was significantly different. The predictive risk score was negatively connected with memory B cells, activated memory CD4 + T cells, M1 macrophages, and CD8 + T cells, and favorably correlated with dendritic cells, mast cells, and neutrophils.ConclusionsOur findings offer fresh perspectives on prognostic evaluation and imply that ARG modulation is implicated in SKCM. Potential medications for the treatment of individuals with various SKCM subtypes were predicted by drug sensitivity analysis.

"PurposeTo explore interpretable machine learning (ML) methods, with the hope of adding more prognosis value, for predicting survival for patients with Oropharyngeal-Cancer (OPC).MethodsA cohort of 427 OPC patients (Training 341, Test 86) from TCIA database was analyzed. Radiomic features of gross-tumor-volume (GTV) extracted from planning CT using Pyradiomics, and HPV p16 status, etc. patient characteristics were considered as potential predictors. A multi-level dimension reduction algorithm consisting of Least-Absolute-Selection-Operator (Lasso) and Sequential-Floating-Backward-Selection (SFBS) was proposed to effectively remove redundant/irrelevant features. The interpretable model was constructed by quantifying the contribution of each feature to the Extreme-Gradient-Boosting (XGBoost) decision by Shapley-Additive-exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm.ResultsThe Lasso-SFBS algorithm proposed in this study finally selected 14 features, and our prediction model achieved an area-under-ROC-curve (AUC) of 0.85 on the test dataset based on this feature set. The ranking of the contribution values calculated by SHAP shows that the top predictors that were most correlated with survival were ECOG performance status, wavelet-LLH_firstorder_Mean, chemotherapy, wavelet-LHL_glcm_InverseVariance, tumor size. Those patients who had chemotherapy, with positive HPV p16 status, and lower ECOG performance status, tended to have higher SHAP scores and longer survival; who had an older age at diagnosis, heavy drinking and smoking pack year history, tended to lower SHAP scores and shorter survival.ConclusionWe demonstrated predictive values of combined patient characteristics and imaging features for the overall survival of OPC patients. The multi-level dimension reduction algorithm can reliably identify the most plausible predictors that are mostly associated with overall survival. The interpretable patient-specific survival prediction model, capturing correlations of each predictor and clinical outcome, was developed to facilitate clinical decision-making for personalized treatment.","PurposeThe updated guidelines highlight gene expression-based multigene panel as a critical tool to assess overall survival (OS) and improve treatment for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Nevertheless, genome-wide expression signatures are still limited in real clinical utility because of insufficient data utilization, a lack of critical validation, and inapposite machine learning algorithms.Methods2330 primary LUAD samples were enrolled from 11 independent cohorts. Seventy-six algorithm combinations based on ten machine learning algorithms were applied. A total of 108 published gene expression signatures were collected. Multiple pharmacogenomics databases and resources were utilized to identify precision therapeutic drugs.ResultsWe comprehensively developed a robust machine learning-derived genome-wide expression signature (RGS) according to stably OS-associated RNAs (OSRs). RGS was an independent risk element and remained robust and reproducible power by comparing it with general clinical parameters, molecular characteristics, and 108 published signatures. RGS-based stratification possessed different biological behaviors, molecular mechanisms, and immune microenvironment patterns. Integrating multiple databases and previous studies, we identified that alisertib was sensitive to the high-risk group, and RITA was sensitive to the low-risk group.ConclusionOur study offers an appealing platform to screen dismal prognosis LUAD patients to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing precision therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04814-y.",1
"BackgroundThyroid carcinoma (THCA) represents a prevalent form of cancer globally, with its incidence demonstrating an upward trend in recent years. Accumulating evidence has indicated that programmed cell death (PCD) patterns exert a vital influence on tumor progression. Nevertheless, the association between PCD and the prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma remains to be elucidated. The current study endeavors to examine the link between PCD and the prognosis of thyroid cancer while concurrently developing a prognostic index based on PCD genes.Materials and methodsProgrammed cell death patterns were employed to construct the model and define clusters. Gene expression profile genomics and clinical data pertaining to 568 patients with thyroid cancer were sourced from the TCGA database. In addition, single-cell transcriptome data GSE184362 were procured from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for subsequent analysis.ResultsThe study harnessed six machine learning algorithms to create a programmed cell death signature (PCDS). Ultimately, the model developed via SVM was chosen as the optimal model, boasting the highest C-index. Moreover, the application of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) led to the identification of two molecular subtypes of THCA, each characterized by distinct vital biological processes and drug sensitivities. The investigation revealed that PCDS is linked to chemokines, interleukins, interferons, and checkpoint genes, as well as pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment, as determined through a comprehensive analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomes. Patients with THCA and elevated PCDS values are more inclined to exhibit resistance to conventional chemotherapy regimens, yet may display heightened responsiveness to targeted therapeutic agents. Finally, we established a nomogram model based on multivariable cox and logistic regression analyses to predict the overall survival of THCA patients.ConclusionThis research sheds new light on the role of programmed cell death (PCD) patterns in THCA. By conducting an in-depth analysis of various cell death patterns, a novel PCD model has been devised, capable of accurately predicting the clinical prognosis and drug sensitivity of patients with THCA.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05252-6.","BackgroundThe FXYD family of ion transport regulators have emerged as important modulators of cancer progression and metastasis. However, their expression and roles in ovarian cancer (OCa) have not been systematically investigated.MethodsThe expression of FXYD genes in OCa was analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as well as independent clinical samples. The prognostic values of FXYD genes were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis. To explore potential mechanisms, bioinformatics approaches including Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway analysis, GSEA and drug sensitivity correlation analysis were performed. OCa cell lines overexpressing FXYD1, FXYD5 or FXYD7 were also generated and their impacts on proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed.ResultsFXYD1 and FXYD6 were significantly downregulated while FXYD3, FXYD4 and FXYD5 were upregulated in OCa tissues compared to normal tissues. FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 were independent adverse prognostic factors for OCa patients. Pathway and drug correlation analysis revealed that FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 genes regulated diverse oncogenic signaling cascades and modulated the response to various chemotherapeutic agents. Overexpression of FXYD1, FXYD5 or FXYD7 enhanced OCa cell motility and invasiveness in vitro.ConclusionOur results demonstrate aberrant expression patterns, prognostic values, and oncogenic activities of FXYD genes in OCa. FXYD1, FXYD5 and FXYD7 may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this disease. Targeting FXYD-mediated signaling represents a promising therapeutic strategy against OCa.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05445-z.",1
"BackgroundT cells have been proven to play important roles in anti-tumor and tumor microenvironment shaping, while these roles have not been explained in bladder cancer (BLCA).MethodsSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database to screen T-cell marker genes. Bulk RNA-sequencing data and clinical information from BLCA patients were downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database to develop a prognosis signature. We analyzed the association of different risk groups with survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and immunotherapy response.ResultsBased on 192 T-cell marker genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis, we constructed a prognostic signature containing 7 genes in the training cohort, which was further validated in the testing cohort and GEO cohort. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 1-, 3-, and 5 years were 0.734, 0.742 and 0.726 in the training cohort, 0.697, 0.671 and 0.670 in the testing cohort, 0.702, 0.665 and 0.629 in the GEO cohort, respectively. In addition, we constructed a nomogram based on clinical factors and the risk score of the signature. The low-risk group exhibited higher immune-related pathways, immune cell infiltration and TMB levels. Importantly, immunophenotype score and immunotherapy cohort (IMvigor210) analyses showed that the low-risk group had better immunotherapy response and prognosis.ConclusionsOur study reveals a novel prognostic signature based on T-cell marker genes, which provides a new target and theoretical support for BLCA patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04881-1.","BackgroundPrognostic modeling of NK cell marker genes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma based on single cell sequencing and transcriptome data analysis.MethodsMarker genes of NK cells were analyzed according to single cell sequencing data of hepatocellular carcinoma. Univariate Cox regression, lasso regression analysis, and multivariate Cox regression were performed to estimate the prognostic value of NK cell marker genes. TCGA, GEO and ICGC transcriptomic data were applied to build and validate the model. Patients were divided into high and low risk groups based on the median risk score. XCELL, timer, quantitative sequences, MCP counter, EPIC, CIBERSORT and CIBERSORT-abs were performed to explore the relationship between risk score and tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally the sensitivity of the model to chemotherapeutic agents was predicted.ResultsSingle-cell sequencing identified 207 marker genes for NK cells in hepatocellular carcinoma. Enrichment analysis suggested that NK cell marker genes were mainly involved in cellular immune function. Eight genes were selected for prognostic modeling after multifactorial COX regression analysis. The model was validated in GEO and ICGC data. Immune cell infiltration and function were higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group. The low-risk group was more suitable for ICI and PD-1 therapy. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of Sorafenib, Lapatinib, Dabrafenib, and Axitinib were significantly different on the two risk groups.ConclusionA new signature of hepatocyte NK cell marker genes possesses a powerful ability to predict prognosis and immunotherapeutic response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.",1
"Bacteria encode an arsenal of diverse systems that defend against phage infection. A common theme uniting many prevalent anti-phage defense systems is the use of specialized nucleotide signals that function as second messengers to activate downstream effector proteins and inhibit viral propagation. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms controlling nucleotide immune signaling in four major families of anti-phage defense systems: CBASS, Pycsar, Thoeris, and type III CRISPR immunity. Analysis of the individual steps connecting phage detection, nucleotide signal synthesis, and downstream effector function reveals shared core principles of signaling and uncovers system-specific strategies used to augment immune defense. We compare recently discovered mechanisms used by phages to evade nucleotide immune signaling and highlight convergent strategies that shape host-virus interactions. Finally, we explain how the evolutionary connection between bacterial anti-phage defense and eukaryotic antiviral immunity defines fundamental rules that govern nucleotide-based immunity across all kingdoms of life.","Introduction:In 2018, durvalumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as consolidation immunotherapy for patients with stage III NSCLC after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, whether durvalumab benefits patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC remains unknown.Methods:We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC who completed concurrent CRT. Kaplan-Meier analyses evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who completed CRT with or without durvalumab.Results:Among 37 patients, 13 initiated durvalumab a median of 20 days after CRT completion. Two patients completed 12 months of treatment, with five patients discontinuing durvalumab owing to progression and five owing to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Of 24 patients who completed CRT without durvalumab, 16 completed CRT alone and eight completed CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Median PFS was 10.3 months in patients who received CRT and durvalumab versus 6.9 months with CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.993). CRT and EGFR TKI was associated with a significantly longer median PFS (26.1 mo) compared with CRT and durvalumab or CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.023). Six patients treated with durvalumab initiated EGFR TKIs after recurrence, with one developing grade 4 pneumonitis on osimertinib.Conclusions:In this study, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC did not benefit with consolidation durvalumab and experienced a high frequency of irAEs. Patients who initiate osimertinib after durvalumab may be susceptible to incident irAEs. Consolidation durvalumab should be approached with caution in this setting and concurrent CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR TKIs further investigated as definitive treatment.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) markedly improve the clinical outcomes of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the intracranial efficacy of ICI is not well elucidated, and previous studies showed discordant outcomes of ICI between intracranial and extracranial diseases. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and the intracranial and extracranial response of patients with NSCLC and brain metastasis who were treated with ICI in the real-world setting.MethodsA total of 55 patients (median age, 63 years [range 42–80]; male, 78%) who had NSCLC with brain metastasis and treated with ICI monotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. We separately assessed the response rates of brain lesions and systemic lesions, and estimated the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).ResultsThe median OS and overall PFS were 17.0 months (95% CI 10.3–25.6) and 3.19 months (95% CI 2.24–5.03), respectively. The intracranial objective response rate and disease control rate of ICI were 36 and 54%, respectively. Among the 44 patients who showed disease progression, only 32% (n = 14) showed concordant outcomes and 9 patients (20%) showed opposing discordant outcomes. Eight patients continued ICI with local brain therapy after intracranial progression, and their median extracranial PFS and OS were 15 months (95% CI 5.0—not assessed [NA]) and 23.8 months (95% CI 14.7—NA), respectively.ConclusionsICI monotherapy had a clinically meaningful intracranial efficacy in NSCLC patients with brain metastasis. Watchful waiting and close monitoring without local radiotherapy might be feasible in NSCLC patients with asymptomatic active brain metastasis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04251-3.","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a dismal 5‐year survival of < 7%, despite the addition of immunotherapy to first‐line chemotherapy. Specific tumor biomarkers, such as delta‐like ligand 3 (DLL3) and schlafen11 (SLFN11), may enable the selection of more efficacious, novel immunomodulating targeted treatments like bispecific T‐cell engaging monoclonal antibodies (tarlatamab) and chemotherapy with PARP inhibitors. However, obtaining a tissue biopsy sample can be challenging in SCLC. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have the potential to provide molecular insights into a patient's cancer through a “simple” blood test. CTCs have been studied for their prognostic ability in SCLC; however, their value in guiding treatment decisions is yet to be elucidated. This review explores novel and promising targeted therapies in SCLC, summarizes current knowledge of CTCs in SCLC, and discusses how CTCs can be utilized for precision medicine.",0
"Heterotrimeric extracellular matrix proteins laminins are mostly deposited at basal membranes and are important in repair and neoplasia. Here, we localize laminin beta 2 (LAMB2) at the sites of blood–brain barrier (BBB). Microvasculature (MV) of normal brain is endowed with complete LAMB2 coverage. In contrast, its cognate protein laminin beta 1 (LAMB1) is absent in MV of normal brain but emerges at the sprouting tip of a growing vessels. Similarly, vascular proliferation in high-grade gliomas (HGG) is accompanied by marked overexpression of LAMB1, whereas LAMB2 shows deficient deposition. We find that many brain pathologies with presence of post-gadolinium enhancement (PGE) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show disruption of LAMB2 vascular ensheathment. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in HGG blocks angiogenesis, suppresses PGE in HGG, prevents expression of LAMB1, and restores LAMB2 vascular coverage. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases shows that in quiescent brain LAMB2 is predominantly expressed by BBB-associated pericytes (PCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), whereas neither cell types produce LAMB1. In contrast, in HGG, both LAMB1 and 2 are overexpressed by endothelial precursor cells, a phenotypically unique immature group, specific to proliferating hyperplastic MV.","BACKGROUND:Differentiating brain metastasis progression from radiation effects or radiation necrosis (RN) remains challenging. Golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI provides high spatial and temporal resolution to analyze tissue enhancement, which may differ between tumor progression (TP) and RN.OBJECTIVE:To investigate the utility of longitudinal GRASP MRI in distinguishing TP from RN after gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).METHODS:We retrospectively evaluated 48 patients with brain metastasis managed with SRS at our institution from 2013 to 2020 who had GRASP MRI before and at least once after SRS. TP (n = 16) was pathologically confirmed. RN (n = 16) was diagnosed on either resected tissue without evidence of tumor or on lesion resolution on follow-up. As a reference, we included a separate group of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer that showed favorable response with tumor control and without RN on subsequent imaging (n = 16). Mean contrast washin and washout slopes normalized to the superior sagittal sinus were compared between groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine diagnostic performance.RESULTS:After SRS, progression showed a significantly steeper washin slope than RN on all 3 follow-up scans (scan 1: 0.29 ± 0.16 vs 0.18 ± 0.08, P = .021; scan 2: 0.35 ± 0.19 vs 0.18 ± 0.09, P = .004; scan 3: 0.32 ± 0.12 vs 0.17 ± 0.07, P = .002). No significant differences were found in the post-SRS washout slope. Post-SRS washin slope differentiated progression and RN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74, a sensitivity of 75%, and a specificity of 69% on scan 1; an AUC of 0.85, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 69% on scan 2; and an AUC of 0.87, a sensitivity of 63%, and a specificity of 100% on scan 3.CONCLUSION:Longitudinal GRASP MRI may help to differentiate metastasis progression from RN.",1
"Our objective was to determine whether social media influences vaccination through informational and normative influences among Democrats and Republicans. We use a probability-based longitudinal study of Americans (N = 1768) collected between December 2022 and September 2023 to examine the prospective associations between social media use and vaccination as well as informational and normative influence as mediating processes. Greater social media use correlates with more frequent vaccination (cross-lagged coefficients: COVID-19 = 0.113, p < 0.001; influenza = 0.123, p < 0.001). The underlying processes, however, vary between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats who use social media more are more likely to vaccinate because they encounter information about new pathogens. In contrast, Republicans who use social media more are more likely to vaccinate because they think that people who are important to them receive the recommended vaccines. Our findings underscore the potential for social media campaigns to promote vaccination, among both Democrats and Republicans by paying attention to the specific processes in each audience.","Therapy resistance is a well-known phenomenon in cancer treatment. It can be intrinsic or acquired, accountable for frequent tumor relapse and death worldwide. The interplay between cancer cells and their neighboring environment can activate complex signaling mechanisms influencing epigenetic changes and maintain cancer cell survival leading to the malignant phenotype. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and constitute the primary source of drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Studies have shown that cancer cells exhibit dysregulated RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) ""writers,"" ""erasers,"" and ""readers"" levels after acquiring drug resistance. The present review provides novel insight into the role of m6A modifiers involved in CSC generation, cancer cell proliferation, and therapy resistance. m6A RNA modifications in the cross-talk between CSC and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have also been highlighted. Further, we have discussed the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A machinery for cancer diagnosis and the development of new therapies for cancer treatment.",0
"Small intestinal metastasis is extremely rare and only 13 cases have been reported till date and almost all such patients have presented with intestinal obstruction. The 5-year overall survival for metastatic esophageal cancer is as low as 5% while the patients with small intestinal metastasis have a median survival of only 3 months (range 1–12 months) despite undergoing radical resection of the small bowel. We present a case of a male in his 50’s who presented with difficulty in swallowing for 4 months. On evaluation, he was found to have squamous cell carcinoma in the mid thoracic esophagus. He underwent radical chemo-radiation up to 60 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. One week after completion of treatment he presented with ileal obstruction and omental nodules and surgical resection and evaluation of the respective ileal segment and omental biopsy revealed a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. The patient expired 3 months post-surgery. Carcinoma esophagus with small bowel metastasis has a very grave prognosis that patients rarely survive beyond 1 year despite undergoing resection. Hence it is imperative to consider a small bowel metastasis when such patients present with clinical features of intestinal obstruction for early diagnosis and aggressive management.","Oral cancer accounts for around 30 percent of all cancers in India. These cancers are usually managed either by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these modalities. Dental oncologists play an integral part in the multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists, nurses, physician assistants, nutritionists, psychologists and social workers to efficiently manage cancer patients. Oral complications associated with cancer therapy can range from minor mucositis or infections to severely debilitating conditions such as osteonecrosis of jaws, which can disrupt the ongoing cancer therapy and jeopardize the overall quality of life of the patient. This highlights the primary role of a dentist in the efficient identification and management of potential oral foci of infection and subsequent prevention of the onset of these complications. This necessitates accurate, evidence-based knowledge and extensive training of dental oncologists to provide state-of-the-art management strategies. This article aims to review oral management before, during and after therapy in patients undergoing treatment for cancers affecting the head and neck region.",1
"Inflammation and a dysregulated immune system are common denominators in cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) highlighted the convergence of interleukin (IL)-1β biology in cancer and CVD, and the potential of anti–IL-1β drugs for the treatment of both disease entities. Accumulating evidence further supports the role of the innate immunity members and IL-1β activators, S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in both cancer and CVD. This review outlines the common involvement of S100A8/9 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, in cancer and CVD. Specifically, their time-, cell-, and context-dependent actions and hereto-related dichotomous role in different cancers and CVD are addressed, highlighting the need for further insights to allow tailored therapies.","BackgroundThis study aims at screening and validation of prospective genetic signature for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) prognosis and treatment.MethodsThe immune-related genes (IRGs) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset where a total of 535 LUAD and 59 control samples were included. A risk model was then developed for the risk stratification of LUAD patients. The immune cell infiltration, clinical outcomes, and the therapeutic efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) blockade were compared between high and low-risk groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to explore the biological processes and signalling pathways associated with the IRGs. Finally, IRGs mRNA levels were assayed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in LUAD and relevant cell lines.ResultsTwo IRGs, P2RX1 (purinergic receptor P2X 1) and PCP4 (Purkinje cell protein 4), were screened from a module that possesses the highest correlation with plasma cells. RT-qPCR verified the expression of the two IRGs in plasmacytoma cell RPMI 8226 but not in LUAD cells. A higher risk score is associated with a lower infiltration of immune cells. Kaplan–Meier and nomogram analysis showed that the high-risk group has a lower survival rate than the low-risk cohort. Furthermore, the high-risk group had a worse response rate to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade. GSVA and GSEA-GO results indicated that a lower risk score is linked to signalling pathways and biological functions promoting immune response and inflammation. In contrast, a higher risk score is associated with signalling cascades promoting tumour growth.ConclusionThe immune-related prognostic model based on P2RX1 and PCP4 is conducive to predicting the therapeutic response of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade and clinical outcomes of LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05153-8.",0
"Host-based gene expression analysis is a promising tool for a broad range of clinical applications, including rapid infectious disease diagnostics and real-time disease monitoring. However, the complex instrumentation requirements and slow turnaround-times associated with traditional gene expression analysis methods have hampered their widespread adoption at the point-of-care (POC). To overcome these challenges, we have developed an automated and portable platform that utilizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and giant magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensors to perform rapid multiplexed, targeted gene expression analysis at the POC. As proof-of-concept, we utilized our platform to amplify and measure the expression of four genes (HERC5, HERC6, IFI27, and IFIH1) that were previously shown to be upregulated in hosts infected with influenza viruses. The compact instrument conducted highly automated PCR amplification and GMR detection to measure the expression of the four genes in multiplex, then utilized Bluetooth communication to relay results to users on a smartphone application. To validate the platform, we tested 20 cDNA samples from symptomatic patients that had been previously diagnosed as either influenza-positive or influenza-negative using a RT-PCR virology panel. A non-parametric Mann–Whitney test revealed that day 0 (day of symptom onset) gene expression was significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.0001, n = 20). Hence, we preliminarily demonstrated that our platform could accurately discriminate between symptomatic influenza and non-influenza populations based on host gene expression in ∼30 min. This study not only establishes the potential clinical utility of our proposed assay and device for influenza diagnostics but it also paves the way for broadscale and decentralized implementation of host-based gene expression diagnostics at the POC.",Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text,0
"Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging criteria, clinical guidelines provide tutorials to clinical management of liver cancer at their individual stages. However, most patients diagnosed with liver cancer are at advanced stage; therefore, many researchers conduct investigations on targeted therapy, aiming to improve the overall survival of these patients. To date, small-molecule-based targeted therapies are highly recommended (first line: sorafenib and lenvatinib; second line: regorafenib and cabozantinib) by current the clinical guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Herein, we summarize the small-molecule-based targeted therapies in liver cancer, including the approved and preclinical therapies as well as the therapies under clinical trials, and introduce their history of discovery, clinical trials, indications, and molecular mechanisms. For drug resistance, the revealed mechanisms of action and the combination therapies are also discussed. In fact, the known small-molecule-based therapies still have limited clinical benefits to liver cancer patients. Therefore, we analyze the current status and give our ideas for the urgent issues and future directions in this field, suggesting clues for novel techniques in liver cancer treatment.","Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) constitute approximately 8% of the human genome and have long been regarded as silent passengers within our genomes. However, the reactivation of HERVs has been increasingly linked to a range of human diseases, particularly the HERV-K (HML-2) family. Many studies are dedicated to elucidating the potential role of HERV-K in pathogenicity. While the underlying mechanisms require further investigation, targeting HERV-K transactivation emerges as a promising avenue for treating human diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative conditions, and infectious diseases. In this review, we summarize recent advancements in the development of HERV-K-targeted therapeutic strategies against various human diseases, including antiretroviral drugs, immunotherapy, and vaccines.",1
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), resulting in poor clinical outcomes and high mortality. The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Punicalagin (PCG), a polyphenol obtained from the Punica granatum, against TNBC. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of PCG in TNBC (MDA-MB-231, BT-20) and ER + (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. A dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was observed with PCG (12.5–100 μM). However, only 50 and 100 μM doses of PCG inhibited the growth of BT-20 and MCF-7 cells. PCG significantly increased mitochondrial ROS in TNBC cells and induced autophagy across all cell lines, as evidenced by an increase in autophagic vacuoles and a decrease in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. PCG suppressed PI3K/Akt and activated phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) signaling. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that PCG is capable of significantly inhibiting the proliferation of TNBC cells through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway as well as the initiation of the JNK pathway. PCG could thus be potentially useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of TNBC.Graphical abstract","BackgroundTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that exhibits elevated glycolytic capacity. Lactate, as a byproduct of glycolysis, is considered a major oncometabolite that plays an important role in oncogenesis and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. However, the potential roles of lactate in TNBC are not yet fully understood. In this study, our goal was to identify prognosis-related lactate genes (PLGs) and construct a lactate-related prognostic model (LRPM) for TNBC.MethodsFirst, we applied lactate-related genes to classify TNBC samples using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Then, we performed the log-rank analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis to screen PLGs and construct the LRPM. The biological functions of the identified PLGs in TNBC were investigated using CCK8 assay and clone formation assay. Finally, we constructed a nomogram based on the lactate-risk score and tumor clinical stage. We used the operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis to evaluate the predictive capability of the nomogram.ResultsOur results showed that the TNBC samples could be classified into two subgroups with different survival probabilities. Three genes (NDUFAF3, CARS2 and FH), which can suppress TNBC cell proliferation, were identified as PLGs. Moreover, the LRPM and nomogram exhibited excellent predictive performance for TNBC patient prognosis.ConclusionWe have developed a novel LRPM that enables risk stratification and identification of poor molecular subtypes in TNBC patients, showing great potential in clinical practice.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05171-6.",1
"Background and aimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and deadly disease with limited treatment options. Regorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promise in HCC treatment but faces limitations as a monotherapy. Combining regorafenib with PD-1 inhibitor may improve efficacy and survival outcomes for patients. This retrospective analysis was conducted to explore its efficacy and safety, providing reference experience for better application of this combination therapy.MethodsThis retrospective single-center study evaluated the efficacy and safety of combining regorafenib with PD-1 blockade for patients with HCC. Efficacy was evaluated according to the RECIST 1.1 evaluation criteria. Safety was assessed using CTCAE 4.0. Data was analyzed to compare survival status in different subgroups.ResultsGenerally, there were 76 patients with HCC elected to receive the regorafenib plus PD-1 blockade treatment during the study period. The objective response rate was 21.1% (n = 16), and the disease control rate was 56.6% (n = 43). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.8 months, and median overall survival had not yet been reached. All patients suffered of at least 1 adverse event. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 31.6% of patients (n = 24), with the most common being hand-foot syndrome, decreased appetite, and abdominal distension. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in PFS based on cirrhosis status or previous treatment lines.ConclusionWith manageable safety, regorafenib combined PD-1 inhibitor could bring survival benefits for advanced HCC who have received systemic treatment. Further, the Cox analysis showed that HBV infection, metastasis, etc. did not have significant effects on the survival benefits.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor with significant global health implications. The role of CD4+ T cells, particularly conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), in HCC progression remains unexplored. Furthermore, epigenetic factors are crucial in immune regulation, yet their specific role in HCC-infiltrating Tconv cells remains elusive. This study elucidates the role of MATR3, an epigenetic regulator, in modulating Tconv activity and immune evasion within the HCC microenvironment. Reanalysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed that early activation of CD4+ T cells is crucial for establishing an antitumor immune response. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that Tconv enhances cDC1-induced CD8+ T-cell activation. Screening identified MATR3 as a critical regulator of Tconv function, which is necessary for antitumour activity but harmful when overexpressed. Excessive MATR3 expression exacerbates Tconv exhaustion and impairs function by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to relax chromatin in the TOX promoter region, leading to aberrant transcriptional changes. In summary, MATR3 is an HCC-specific epigenetic checkpoint that bidirectionally regulates Tconv antitumour immunity, suggesting new therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic regulators to enhance antitumour immunity in HCC.",0
"PurposeTumor spread through air space (STAS) is a novel pattern of invasion related to poor prognosis in non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, little is known about the role of STAS in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We sought to determine whether STAS has a significant effect on recurrence among SCLC patients.MethodsWe collected clinical and follow-up information from 181 resected stage I–III SCLC patients and compared overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the patients with or without STAS using the Kaplan‒Meier method. To explore the effect of STAS on recurrence, a competing-risk analysis was conducted.ResultsAmong 181 SCLC patients, STAS was observed in 56 (30.94%) patients, and 125 (69.06%) patients did not have STAS. Furthermore, 33 (18.23%) patients had recurrence, including 12 patients with brain metastases. Patients with STAS had worse DFS. The cumulative incidence of any recurrence was higher in patients with STAS than in those without STAS. Univariate and multivariate competing-risk regression analyses revealed that sublobar resection and STAS were independent risk factors for SCLC recurrence (p = 0.009 and p = 0.029 for multivariate analysis, respectively).ConclusionSCLC patients with STAS have worse DFS than SCLC patients without STAS. STAS is an independent prognostic factor in SCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04462-8.","Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), an immune checkpoint molecule expressed on activated T cells, functions as a negative regulator of immune responses. Persistent antigen exposure in the tumor microenvironment results in sustained LAG3 expression on T cells, contributing to T cell dysfunction. Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) has been identified as a major ligand of LAG3, and FGL1/LAG3 interaction forms a novel immune checkpoint pathway that results in tumor immune evasion. In addition, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7) plays a crucial role in cancer development. In this study we investigated the role of USP7 in modulation of FGL1-mediated liver cancer immune evasion. We showed that knockdown of USP7 or treatment with USP7 inhibitor P5091 suppressed liver cancer growth by promoting CD8+ T cell activity in Hepa1-6 xenograft mice and in HepG2 or Huh7 cells co-cultured with T cells, whereas USP7 overexpression produced the opposite effect. We found that USP7 upregulated FGL1 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells by deubiquitination of transcriptional factor PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1), which transcriptionally activated FGL1, and attenuated the CD8+ T cell activity, leading to the liver cancer growth. Interestingly, USP7 could be transcriptionally stimulated by PRDM1 as well in a positive feedback loop. P5091, an inhibitor of USP7, was able to downregulate FGL1 expression, thus enhancing CD8+ T cell activity. In an immunocompetent liver cancer mouse model, the dual blockade of USP7 and LAG3 resulted in a superior antitumor activity compared with anti-LAG3 therapy alone. We conclude that USP7 diminishes CD8+ T cell activity by a USP7/PRDM1 positive feedback loop on FGL1 production in liver cancer; USP7 might be a promising target for liver cancer immunotherapy.",0
"IntroductionOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent malignant condition. This study aimed to investigate the role of mTORC1 signaling and develop a prognostic model for OSCC.Materials and MethodsThe single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was utilized to calculate the Z-Score of Hallmarks in OSCC, followed by univariate Cox regression analysis to identify processes associated with prognosis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed using transcriptomic data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) cohort to identify genes correlated with mTORC1 signaling. A six-gene prognostic model was constructed using multifactorial Cox regression analysis and validated using an external dataset.ResultsThe study uncovered a strong linkage between mTORC1, glycolysis, hypoxia, and the prognosis of OSCC. mTORC1 signaling emerged as the most significant risk factor, negatively impacting patient survival. Additionally, a six-gene prognostic risk score model was developed which provided a quantitative measure of patients' survival probabilities. Interestingly, within the context of these findings, TP53 gene mutations were predominantly observed in the high-risk group, potentially underlining the genetic complexity of this patient subgroup. Additionally, differential immune cell infiltration and an integrated nomogram were also reported.ConclusionThis study highlights the importance of mTORC1 signaling in OSCC prognosis and presents a robust prognostic model for predicting patient outcomes.","BackgroundThe incidence of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), one of the most aggressive and lethal skin tumors, is increasing worldwide. However, for advanced SKCM, we still lack an accurate and valid way to predict its prognosis, as well as novel theories to guide the planning of treatment options for SKCM patients. Lactylation (LAC), a novel post-translational modification of histones, has been shown to promote tumor growth and inhibit the antitumor response of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a variety of ways. We hope that this study will provide new ideas for treatment options for SKCM patients, as well as research on the molecular mechanisms of SKCM pathogenesis and development.MethodsAt the level of the RNA sequencing set (TCGA, GTEx), we used differential expression analysis, LASSO regression analysis, and multifactor Cox regression analysis to screen for prognosis-related genes and calculate the corresponding LAC scores. The content of TME cells in the tumor tissue was calculated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and the TME score was calculated based on its results. Finally, the LAC–TME classifier was established and further analyzed based on the two scores, including the construction of a prognostic model, analysis of clinicopathological characteristics, and correlation analysis of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immunotherapy. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, this study analyzed the cellular composition in SKCM tissues and explored the role of LAC scores in intercellular communication. To validate the functionality of the pivotal gene CLPB in the model, cellular experiments were ultimately executed.ResultsWe screened a total of six prognosis-related genes (NDUFA10, NDUFA13, CLPB, RRM2B, HPDL, NARS2) and 7 TME cells with good prognosis. According to Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, we found that the LAClow/TMEhigh group had the highest overall survival (OS) and the LAChigh/TMElow group had the lowest OS (p value < 0.05). In further analysis of immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME), functional enrichment, tumor mutational load and immunotherapy, we found that immunotherapy was more appropriate in the LAClow/TMEhigh group. Moreover, the cellular assays exhibited substantial reductions in proliferation, migration, and invasive potentials of melanoma cells in both A375 and A2058 cell lines upon CLPB knockdown.ConclusionsThe prognostic model using the combined LAC score and TME score was able to predict the prognosis of SKCM patients more consistently, and the LAC–TME classifier was able to significantly differentiate the prognosis of SKCM patients across multiple clinicopathological features. The LAC–TME classifier has an important role in the development of immunotherapy regimens for SKCM patients.",1
"Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3) is a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein family expressed in the extracellular matrix closely associated with the development and occurrence of various malignant tumors; yet, its function in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is still poorly understood. The following study investigated the progress and mechanism of HAPLN3 on ccRCC using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments. In order to determine whether HAPLN3 is differentially expressed in ccRCC, we analyzed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE40435 and further validated them in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Simultaneously, the TCGA dataset was utilized to study the relationship between HAPLN3 expression and the progression of ccRCC and its prognostic value in ccRCC. Gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore HAPLN3-related signaling pathways in ccRCC. The TIMER database investigates the link for both HAPLN3 and immune cell infiltration. Different ccRCC cell lines the role of HAPLN3 on cell biological behavior in vitro. HAPLN3 was increased in ccRCC, and its high expression was related to the patients' survival rates and clinical characteristics. GSEA showed that HAPLN3 is mainly enriched in proliferative and metastatic pathways. In addition, HAPLN3 was an independently associated significant predictor in patients with ccRCC. Functional experiments demonstrated that HAPLN3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. To sum up, our data suggest that HAPLN3 may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.","BackgroundThe widespread use of oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (FOLFOX) in advanced gastric cancers is mainly based on clinical trials conducted at Western/European countries. The prospective data on efficacy and safety of FOLFOX in advanced gastric cancer is lacking from the developing countries. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of mFOLFOX-6 in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas, as first-line palliative chemotherapy.Methods Patients with previously untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach/GEJ, received mFOLFOX-6 (2 hours infusion of oxaliplatin [85 mg/m 2 ] and folinic acid [400 mg/m 2 ], followed by fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 intravenous push, then a 46-hour continuous infusion of 5-FU [2,400 mg/m 2 ]). Cycles were repeated every 2 weeks. The patients were prospectively followed up for response rates and toxicity. ResultsSixty-six patients were included in the study with a median age of 57 years. Sixty-two patients were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 53%, with a disease control rate (overall response and stable disease) of 81.8%. The median progression-free survival was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2–6.7 months) and the median overall survival was 11.5 months (95% CI 9.0–13.9 months). Ascites at presentation and more than one site of metastasis are associated with significantly lower survival on the log-rank test. Gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities were predominant, with rates of grade 3 to 4 nausea/vomiting (13.6%), anemia (15.1%), and neutropenia (13.6%). Among other toxicities, neurosensory toxicities were common. Four (6%) patients had grade 3 peripheral neuropathy.ConclusionmFOLFOX-6 is an active and well-tolerated chemotherapy regimen in advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach/GEJ. This regimen has similar response rates and treatment outcomes with lesser grade 3 or 4 toxicities than that of triplet regimens compared to historical studies.",0
"BackgroundSeveral translational animal models have been described assessing intra-arterial (IA) treatments for malignant gliomas. We describe the first endovascular animal model that allows testing of IA drug delivery as a first-line treatment, which is difficult to do in actual patients. We report a unique protocol for vascular access and IA delivery in the rat model that, unlike prior reports, does not require direct puncture and opening of proximal cerebrovasculature which carries risk of ischemia in the animal brain post-delivery.MethodsWistar rats underwent left femoral artery catherization with a Balt Magic 1.2F catheter or Marathon Flow directed 1.5F Microcatheter with an Asahi Chikai 0.008 micro-guidewire which was navigated to the left internal carotid artery under x-ray. 25% mannitol was administered to test blood brain barrier breakdown (BBBB). Additional rats were implanted with C6 glioma cells in the left frontal lobe. C6 Glioma-Implanted Rats (C6GRs) were monitored for overall survival and tumor growth. Tumor volumes from MRI images were calculated utilizing 3D slicer. Additional rats underwent femoral artery catheterization with Bevacizumab, carboplatin, or irinotecan injected into the left internal carotid artery to test feasibility and safety.ResultsA successful endovascular access and BBBB protocol was established. BBBB was confirmed with positive Evans blue staining. 10 rats were successfully implanted with C6 gliomas with confirmed growths on MRI. Overall survival was 19.75 ± 2.21 days. 5 rats were utilized for the development of our femoral catheterization protocol and BBBB testing. With regards to IA chemotherapy dosage testing, control rats tolerated targeted 10 mg/kg of bevascizumab, 2.4 mg/kg of carboplatin, and 15 mg/kg of irinotecan IA ICA injections without any complications.ConclusionsWe present the first endovascular IA rat glioma model that allows selective catheterization of the intracranial vasculature and assessment of IA therapies for gliomas without need for access and sacrifice of proximal cerebrovasculature.","PurposeGlioma is the most common and fatal type of brain tumour. Owing to its aggressiveness and lethality, early diagnosis and prediction of patient survival are very important. This study aimed to identify key genes and biomarkers for glioma that can guide clinicians in making rapid diagnosis and prognostication.MethodsData mining of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data, and Genotype-Tissue Expression Project brain expression data revealed significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the risk scores of individual patients were calculated. WGCNA was utilized to screen for genes most related to clinical diagnosis. Prognostic genes associated with glioma were selected via combining the LASSO regression with univariate and multivariate Cox regression and protein–protein interaction network analyses. Then, a nomogram was constructed. And CGGA dataset was utilized to validated. The protein expression levels of the signature were detected using the human protein atlas. Drug response prediction was carried out using the package “pRRophetic”.ResultsA six-gene signature (KLF6, CHI3L1, SERPINE1, ANGPT2, TGFBR1, and PTX3) was identified and used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups. Survival, ROC curve, and Cox analyses clarified that the six hub genes were a favourable independent prognostic factor for patients with glioma. A nomogram was set up by integrating clinical parameters with risk signatures, showing high precision for predicting 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-years survival. In addition, the expression of most genes was consistent with protein expression. Furthermore, the sensitivity to the top ten drugs in the GDSC database of the high-risk group was significantly higher than the low-risk group.ConclusionBased on genetic profiles and clinicopathological features, including age, grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status, we constructed a comprehensive prognostic model for patients with glioma. These signatures can be regarded as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of gliomas, possibly providing more therapeutic strategies for future clinical research.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05082-6.",1
"PurposeThe aim of the study was to construct a risk score model based on m6A-related targets to predict overall survival and immunotherapy response in ovarian cancer.MethodsThe gene expression profiles of 24 m6A regulators were extracted. Survival analysis screened 9 prognostic m6A regulators. Next, consensus clustering analysis was applied to identify clusters of ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, 47 phenotype-related differentially expressed genes, strongly correlated with 9 prognostic m6A regulators, were screened and subjected to univariate and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. Ultimately, a nomogram was constructed which presented a strong ability to predict overall survival in ovarian cancer.ResultsCBLL1, FTO, HNRNPC, METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, ZC3H13, RBM15B and YTHDC2 were associated with worse overall survival (OS) in ovarian cancer. Three m6A clusters were identified, which were highly consistent with the three immune phenotypes. What is more, a risk model based on seven m6A-related targets was constructed with distinct prognosis. In addition, the low-risk group is the best candidate population for immunotherapy.ConclusionWe comprehensively analyzed the m6A modification landscape of ovarian cancer and detected seven m6A-related targets as an independent prognostic biomarker for predicting survival. Furthermore, we divided patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct prognosis and select the optimum population which may benefit from immunotherapy and constructed a nomogram to precisely predict ovarian cancer patients’ survival time and visualize the prediction results.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04162-3.","PurposeWe aimed to investigate the molecular characteristics of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) by analyzing ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) expression data to predict prognosis.MethodsGene expression and clinicopathological data of patients with CESC were collected from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression databases. Using Cox regression analysis, we identified 21 FRGs associated with prognosis. Cluster analysis categorized patients into subgroups based on these genes and compared their clinicopathological, biological, and immune infiltration features. FRG methylation levels were examined, and a risk model based on such FRG methylation levels was constructed using LASSO and Cox regression analyses. The model’s predictive capacity was validated, and the relationships between the risk score and immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment, and drug sensitivity were explored. FRG methylation in CESC tissues was validated by immunohistochemistry.ResultsWe identified 21 FRGs associated with CESC prognosis. Patients were stratified into two subtypes based on these genes, they showed differences in prognosis, immune cell types, and immune checkpoint expression. A three-gene risk score (including AQP3, MGST1, and TFRC) was generated, and the low-risk group showed better overall survival. The high-risk and low-risk groups differed in terms of immune infiltration, gene mutations, and drug sensitivity. Experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of AQP3 and TFRC, whereas MGST1 expression was not significantly altered in CESC tissues compared with that in normal cervical tissues.ConclusionThis study highlights the potential role of FRG methylation in predicting CESC prognosis and provides a personalized assessment of immune responses in patients with CESC.",1
"Background and PurposeThe use of oncolytic viruses as a gene therapy vector is an area of active biomedical research, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. However, the actual therapeutic success of this approach to tumor elimination remains limited. As such, the present study was developed with the goal of simultaneously enhancing the antitumor efficacy of oncolytic viruses and the local immune response by combining the Ad-GD55 oncolytic adenovirus and an antibody specific for the TIM-3 immune checkpoint molecule (α-TIM-3).Approach and Key ResultsThe results of Virus and cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay, qPCR, and Western immunoblotting showed that Ad-GD55–α-Tim-3 oncolytic adenovirus is capable of inducing α-TIM-3 expression within hepatoma cells upon infection, and Ad-GD55–α-TIM-3 exhibited inhibitory efficacy superior to that of Ad-GD55 when used to treat these tumor cells together with the induction of enhanced intracellular immunity. In vivo experiments revealed that Ad-GD55–α-TIM-3 administration was sufficient to inhibit tumor growth and engage in a more robust local immune response within the simulated tumor immune microenvironment.Conclusion and ImplicationsThese results highlighted the promising therapeutic effects of Ad-GD55–α-TIM-3 oncolytic adenovirus against HCC in vitro and in vivo. As such, this Ad-GD55–α-TIM-3 oncolytic adenovirus may represent a viable approach to the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05501-8.","Collagen contributes to extracellular matrix formation and stiffness, providing a three-dimensional framework that supports the development and growth of solid tumors. By interacting with specific tumor cell receptors, collagen influences tumor cell signaling pathways, promoting cancer progression and drug resistance. Recent advancements in understanding the tumor extracellular matrix have underscored collagen's role in fostering an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and acting as a barrier to immunotherapy. Understanding the immunosuppressive mechanisms of collagen in the TME has revealed novel therapeutic targets and opportunities. This review highlights the immunoregulatory functions of collagen in the TME and provides a comprehensive overview of integrating collagen scores with traditional immunoscore-based immunotyping methods to enhance response prediction. Additionally, we discuss recent therapeutic developments in collagen targeting and their clinical potential for enhancing anti-cancer immunity.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundThe co-occurrence of PD-L1 positivity and EGFR mutations in advanced NSCLC often limits EGFR-TKIs effectiveness, with unclear mechanisms.MethodsWe analyzed 103 treatment-naive EGFR-mutant LUAD patients from three centers, assessing PD-L1 expression and performing NGS analysis.ResultsSMO mutations and MET amplification were significantly higher in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% group versus PD-L1 < 1% group (SMO: 8% vs. 0%, p = 0.048; MET: 18% vs. 7%, p = 0.023). The DNA Damage Response and Repair (DDR) pathogenic deficiency mutations, along with biological processes and signaling pathways related to DNA recombination, cell cycle transition and abnormal phosphorylation, were more prevalent in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% group. PIK3CA and RARA clonal alterations were more common in PD-L1 < 1% group, while TP53 clonal mutations predominated in PD-L1 ≥ 1% group. Retrospective analysis showed EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy extended median PFS by 9.8 months, potentially overcoming EGFR-TKI monotherapy resistance.ConclusionThis study elucidates the genomic characteristics of PD-L1-induced resistance to EGFR-TKIs. For patients with concurrent mutations in EGFR and PD-L1 expression, a first-line treatment strategy combining EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy may offer a more effective alternative.","Chemotherapy holds a prominent position in contemporary cancer treatment modalities; however, poor water solubility, rapid clearance, and unintended side effects remain significant challenges. To mitigate these issues, various nanoparticle-based delivery systems have been devised to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of chemotherapeutic drugs. While biocompatible, most of these drug delivery systems include materials that are foreign to the human body. Consequently, it is critical for these materials to be effectively removed from the body to prevent potential toxicity. In this study, we introduce a nanoparticle-based system that utilizes only hemin, which is naturally found in the body, as an amphiphilic coating agent to facilitate the solubilization of hydrophobic drugs. Camptothecin (CPT), Paclitaxel (PTX), and Sorafenib (SOR) were each formulated into stable hemin-coated nanoparticles (HeminNPs). We demonstrate that hemin-coated CPT nanoparticles exhibit an improved safety profile and therapeutic efficacy, compared with the administration of CPT alone, in a murine tumor model of triple-negative breast cancer. Consequently, utilizing HeminNPs demonstrates potential in reducing off-target toxicity and amplifying the therapeutic effectiveness of cancer treatments, which may ultimately contribute to improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients.",1
"ObjectivesThe programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) in tumor tissue samples is an established clinical biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the significance of PD-L1 expression in other types of samples has not been fully investigated.Patients and methodsWe conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of advanced NSCLC patients who received ICI treatment during the clinical course and investigated the effects of ICIs according to PD-L1 expression in cytology samples, including cell block and endobronchial ultrasound-guided (EBUS) transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) samples.ResultsA total of 264 patients were included in this study: PD-L1 expression was determined in cell block or TBNA specimens in 55 patients, and in tissue samples in 209 patients. Among the former patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) of those with a TPS for PD-L1 ≥ 50% was significantly longer compared to that of those with a TPS < 50% (6.5 vs. 1.9 months, respectively, p = 0.008). When the cutoff value was set at 1%, the median PFS was 4.2 months in patients with a TPS ≥ 1% and 1.5 months in patients with a TPS < 1% (p < 0.001).ConclusionPD-L1 expression determined using cytology specimens predicts the efficacy of ICIs.","PurposeThe treatment options for metastatic soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are limited. In most cases, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has not been successful so far. Macrophages dominate the immune landscape of STSs; thus, combinatorial strategies aiming at both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages may represent a particularly relevant treatment approach for metastatic or recurrent STSs.MethodsIn this cohort study, 66 patients who underwent surgery for STSs were enrolled. Tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In cell suspensions obtained from surgical resections, human T cells were activated by superparamagnetic polymer beads and cultured at a concentration of 0.3 × 106/µl in the absence or presence of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (anti-PD-1, anti-CD47, and anti-PD-1 + anti-CD47). Supernatants from cell suspensions were analyzed using multiplex Luminex cytokine bead-based immunoassays.ResultsThe most profound response to anti-CD47 therapy was observed in an undifferentiated pleiomorphic sarcoma which also displayed high expression of CD47 in the tumor microenvironment. Both anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 therapies drastically increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment of STSs, but co-administration of both agents did not further increase cytokine secretion. Furthermore, all patient samples treated with a combination of both anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 antibodies showed a dramatic reduction in cytokine secretion.ConclusionOur findings suggest that anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 therapies do not enhance each other, and the combined application of anti-PD-1 and anti-CD47 agents in vitro limits rather than potentiates their efficacy.",0
"PurposeNeuroblastoma is a challenging pediatric tumor with a need for improved treatment strategies. This study explores the role of disulfidptosis, a form of cell death induced by intracellular disulfide accumulation, in neuroblastoma and its implications for prognosis and immune infiltration.MethodsWe subgrouped neuroblastoma samples based on disulfidptosis-related gene expression and constructed a disulfidptosis potential index (DPI) to quantify disulfidptosis levels in neurobalstoma. The correlation between DPI, outcome, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity were explored.ResultsCombing RNA-seq and single-cell dataset, we found that higher disulfidptosis potential index (DPI) is associated with poorer outcomes in neuroblastoma patients, indicating the detrimental impact of enhanced disulfide stress and cellular dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that higher DPI is correlated with reduced immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an immunosuppressive milieu in high DPI neuroblastomas. The DPI-high neuroblastoma may benefit from the estrogen pathway related drug fulvestrant.ConclusionOverall, this study highlights the significance of disulfidptosis as a potential therapeutic target and underscores the importance of integrating immune modulation strategies, offering new avenues for improved management of neuroblastoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05392-9.","PurposeThe primary objective of this study was to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks and evaluate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and key biomarkers within the ceRNA networks in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients.MethodsComprehensive bioinformatics tools were used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs (DEMs), and lncRNAs (DELs) related to COAD, leading to the creation of ceRNA networks. The CIBERSORT technique was employed to assess the significance of TIICs in COAD, and an immune-related prognosis prediction model was subsequently developed. Co-expression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between key genes in ceRNA networks and immunologically significant TIICs. The study also utilized 5 GEO datasets and web-based databases to externally validate the findings.ResultsThe study revealed a statistically significant relationship between key hub genes and immune cells, as determined through co-expression analysis. Two hub regulators (SOX12 and H19) demonstrated significant prognostic value in the ceRNA-related prognostic model, and their elevated expression levels were verified across multiple CRC cell lines. Additionally, the knockdown of SOX12 led to a suppression of proliferation, migration, and invasion in colon cancer cells.ConclusionThrough the construction of ceRNA networks and evaluation of TIICs, the study successfully established two risk score models and nomograms. These models serve as valuable tools for understanding the molecular processes and predicting the prognosis of COAD patients. Further validation of hub regulators SOX12 and H19 substantiates their potential role as key biomarkers in COAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05316-7.",1
"PurposeOlder patients with cancer are underrepresented in pivotal trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This study aimed to investigate immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that occur in older patients with lung cancer treated with ICIs, and explore predictors of the occurrence of irAEs.MethodsA prospective analysis was performed on older patients with lung cancer aged ≥ 65 years who were treated with anti-programmed cell death-1/-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors in Beijing Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. The incidence and risk factors of irAEs were estimated by the Chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The predictive power of Geriatric-8 (G-8) for irAEs was tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Lymphocyte counts were measured by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels were tested by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculated progression-free survival (PFS) curves, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences.ResultsA total of 201 older patients aged ≥ 65 years with lung cancer were enrolled in this study. The most common irAEs were interstitial pneumonia, dermatological toxicity and hypothyroidism, with rates of 17.2%, 16.1% and 5.6%, respectively. ROC showed that G-8 could predict the occurrence of irAEs in patients aged 65–71 years (≥ G2 irAEs: AUC = 0.757, p < 0.001; ≥ G3 irAEs: AUC = 0.862, p < 0.001), but not for patients aged ≥ 71 years. NLR, LMR, PNI, hypertension and diabetes were associated with irAEs. Lower CD4 + T cells and B cells, and lower levels of IL-10 were associated with the development of irAEs.ConclusionOur study confirmed the accuracy of G-8 for predicting irAEs in older patients. We also identified several predictors of irAEs in older patients with lung cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04792-1.","BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options. Nanotechnology, particularly the use of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), offers new perspectives for targeted photothermal therapies.ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of nanomediated photothermal therapy (PTT) using GNP functionalized with folate and anti-Cadherin-1 antibodies (Cad-1) in the treatment of HCC in a validated murine model.MethodsA bionanosystem composed of gold nanoparticles conjugated with polyethyleneimine (PEI), folic acid (FA), and Cad-1 was synthesized and characterized. A HCC murine model was induced by administration of diethylnitrosamine and carbon tetrachloride. After tumor confirmation, animals were divided into four groups and treated with different doses of the nanoconstruct, followed by near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation (808 nm). A total of 16 animals were allocated into four experimental groups (n = 4 per group). Histological analysis and serum biochemical assays (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)) were performed.ResultsThe treatment induced focal coagulative necrosis within tumor regions, with minimal impact on surrounding healthy liver tissue. Significant reductions in AST and GGT levels were observed in animals treated with higher doses (p < 0.05), confirming the efficacy and selectivity of the therapy. Immunohistochemistry confirmed E-cadherin overexpression in tumor tissue, suggesting a possible diagnosic potential for the targeting system.ConclusionThe GNPs-PEI-FA-Cad-1 system demonstrated promising results for targeted photothermal therapy in HCC, with selective tumor ablation and limited hepatotoxicity. The validated murine model provides a robust platform for preclinical assessment of similar nanotherapies.",0
"Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a type of RNA that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where it is translated into proteins. mRNA has emerged as a powerful platform for development of new types of medicine, especially after the clinical approval of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Chemical modification and nanoparticle delivery have contributed to this success significantly by improving mRNA stability, reducing its immunogenicity, protecting it from enzymatic degradation, and enhancing cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Recently, substantial progresses have been made in new modification chemistries, sequence design, and structural engineering to generate more stable and efficient next-generation mRNAs. These innovations could further facilitate the clinical translation of mRNA therapies and vaccines. Given that numerous review articles have been published on mRNA nanoparticle delivery and biomedical applications over the last few years, we herein focus on overviewing recent advances in mRNA chemical modification, mRNA sequence optimization, and mRNA engineering (for example, circular RNA and multitailed mRNA), with the aim of providing new perspectives on the development of more effective and safer mRNA medicines.","In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical research, the emergence of RNA-based therapeutics is paradigm shifting. It is mainly driven by the molecular adaptability and capacity to provide precision in targeting. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic crisis underscored the effectiveness of the mRNA therapeutic development platform and brought it to the forefront of RNA-based interventions. These RNA-based therapeutic approaches can reshape gene expression, manipulate cellular functions, and correct the aberrant molecular processes underlying various diseases. The new technologies hold the potential to engineer and deliver tailored therapeutic agents to tackle genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases in a highly personalized and precisely tuned manner.

"ObjectivesThe project is designed to compare the clinical efficacy and adverse events resulting from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).MethodsPubMed Database and ClinicalTrials.gov were both searched to identify randomized controlled clinical trials for assessing ICIs in all-stage SCLC. After screening in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible studies were evaluated in regard to the population, intervention, comparator, outcome as well as study design (PICOS) pattern. Furthermore, primary endpoints of these randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and complete/objective response rate (CRR/ORR). Statistical analyses were realized via Review Manager Version 5.3 Software.ResultsCompared with the chemotherapy alone group, the ICIs plus chemotherapy group significantly improved with respect to such indicators as OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.90, P < 0.0001), PFS (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.87, P < 0.00001) and ORR (64.7% versus 59.1%). According to the safety analysis, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) at all grades was higher in ICIs plus chemotherapy group (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.20–2.10, P = 0.001), bearing no statistical significance at grade 3 or above (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.99–1.49, P = 0.07).ConclusionsThe combination of ICIs and chemotherapy witnessed better anti-neoplastic efficacy for SCLC. Moreover, the incidence of trAEs at all grades was elevated in ICIs plus chemotherapy group, with little discrepancy in both groups at grade 3 or above.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), resulting in poor clinical outcomes and high mortality. The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Punicalagin (PCG), a polyphenol obtained from the Punica granatum, against TNBC. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of PCG in TNBC (MDA-MB-231, BT-20) and ER + (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. A dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was observed with PCG (12.5–100 μM). However, only 50 and 100 μM doses of PCG inhibited the growth of BT-20 and MCF-7 cells. PCG significantly increased mitochondrial ROS in TNBC cells and induced autophagy across all cell lines, as evidenced by an increase in autophagic vacuoles and a decrease in the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. PCG suppressed PI3K/Akt and activated phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) signaling. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that PCG is capable of significantly inhibiting the proliferation of TNBC cells through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway as well as the initiation of the JNK pathway. PCG could thus be potentially useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of TNBC.Graphical abstract",0
"PurposeEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is a frequent digestive tract malignant carcinoma with a high fatality rate. Daphne altaica (D. altaica), a medicinal plant that is frequently employed in Kazakh traditional medicine, and which has traditionally been used to cure cancer and respiratory conditions, but research on the mechanism is lacking. Therefore, we examined and verified the hub genes and mechanism of D. altaica treating ESCC.MethodsActive compounds and targets of D. altaica were screened by databases such as TCMSP, and ESCC targets were screened by databases such as GeneCards and constructed the compound-target network and PPI network. Meantime, data sets between tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from GEO database (GSE100942, GPL570) were analyzed to obtain DEGs using the limma package in R. Hub genes were validated using data from the Kaplan–Meier plotter database, TIMER2.0 and GEPIA2 databases. Finally, AutoDock software was used to predict the binding sites through molecular docking.ResultsIn total, 830 compound targets were obtained from TCMSP and other databases. In addition, 17,710 disease targets were acquired based on GeneCards and other databases. In addition, we constructed the compound-target network and PPI network. Then, 127 DEGs were observed (82 up-regulated and 45 down-regulated genes). Hub genes were screened including TOP2A, NUF2, CDKN2A, BCHE, and NEK2, and had been validated with the help of several publicly available databases. Finally, molecular docking results showed more stable binding between five hub genes and active compounds.ConclusionsIn the present study, five hub genes were screened and validated, and potential mechanisms of action were predicted, which could provide a theoretical understanding of the treatment of ESCC with D. altaica.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04797-w.","ObjectiveThis investigation seeks to explore the mechanism of quercetin in oral cancer by incorporating network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking.MethodsFirst, we use the network pharmacology analysis to discover possible core targets for quercetin and oral cancer. We subsequently utilized the docking of molecules techniques to calculate the affinities of critical targets and quercetin for verification.ResultsTCMSP and the Swiss Target Prediction database found 190 quercetin action targets, while GeneCards, OMIM, PharmGkb, and the Therapeutic Target Database found 8971 oral cancer-related targets. Venny 2.1.0 online software conducted an intersection analysis of quercetin-related target information with information about oral cancer, and 172 putative quercetin-anti-oral cancer targets were examined. Six prospective core targets for quercetin treatment of oral cancer were identified from the PPI network topology analysis of 172 putative therapeutic targets. These targets include AKT1, PIK3R1, MYC, HIF1A, SRC, and HSP90AA1. GO enrichment function analysis showed that 2372 biological processes, 98 cell components, and 201 molecular functions were involved. Through enrichment analysis of the KEGG pathway, 172 signal pathways were obtained. A few examples are PI3K-AKT, HIF-1, IL-17, and other signaling pathways. The molecular docking scores of quercetin and the primary therapeutic targets AKT1, HIF1A, HSP90AA1, MYC, PIK3R1, and SRC are all less than -0.7 points, demonstrating good compatibility between the medicine and small molecules and suggesting that quercetin may affect oral cancer through the primary target.ConclusionThis study explores quercetin’s mechanism and possible targets for oral cancer treatment, offering novel approaches. Quercetin may be a multitarget medication against oral cancer in the future.",1
"AbstractObjectiveNon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading attributor to cancer deaths. High HDAC10 and low microRNA (miR)-223-5p levels have been observed in NSCLC. But their roles remain elusive. This study illustrated their roles in NSCLC cell ferroptosis and the mechanism.MethodsHDAC10, miR-223-5p, and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) levels in cells were determined by RT-qPCR. Iron ion content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione (GSH) levels were tested using reagent kits, and levels of SLC7A11 and Acyl-CoA synthesis long chain family (ACSL4) were examined using Western blot. Chromatin immunoprecision was performed to analyze the enrichment of HDAC10 and acetylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9ac) on the miR-223-5p promoter. The targeted binding of miR-223-5p and SLC7A11 was analyzed by dual-luciferase assay. Joint experiments were designed to identify the role of miR-223-5p/SLC7A11 axis in HDAC10-regulated ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.ResultsHDAC10 was highly expressed in NSCLC cells. Silencing HDAC10 significantly reduced GSH and SLC7A11 levels, upregulated iron ion content, ROS levels, and ACSL4 expression, promoting cell ferroptosis. Mechanically, HDAC10 inhibited miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby targeting SLC7A11. The joint experimental results showed that overexpression of SLC7A11 or downregulation of miR-223-5p alleviated the promoting effect of silencing HDAC10 on ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.ConclusionHDAC10 inhibits miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby promoting SLC7A11 expression and inhibiting ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.","PurposeBaseline tumor size (BTS) and the presence of massive lesions are important for predicting the clinical course of cancer. However, their impact on survival and clinical response in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment has been scarcely investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 294 patients who underwent ICI therapy for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between January 2016 and July 2019.ResultsOf these 294 patients, 284 (96.6%) had at least one measurable lesion. Of these, 263 patients treated with ICI monotherapy were included in the analysis. The median total and maximum target lesion diameters were 96.5 mm and 49.1 mm, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) with massive lesions (max BTS > 50 mm, group A) and without massive lesions (max BTS ≤ 50 mm, group B) was 2.5 months (95% CI 1.8–3.7) and 6.7 months (95% CI 5.1–9.7), respectively. Median overall survival (OS) for groups A and B was 9.5 months (95% CI 5.5–12.3) and 20.0 months (95% CI 13.3–32.0), respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between the presence of massive lesions and both PFS and OS.ConclusionThe presence of massive lesions (max diameters > 50 mm) is an independent prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC treated with ICI monotherapy. Although overall response rates were similar between groups A and B, the disease control rate was significantly poorer for group A. Max BTS might be useful for predicting clinical outcomes for patients undergoing immunotherapy as a parameter reflecting their tumor burden.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03271-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"SUMMARYDetection of the presence of infection and its etiology must be accurate and timely to facilitate appropriate antimicrobial use. Diagnostic strategies that rely solely on pathogen detection often are insufficient due to poor test characteristics, inability to differentiate colonization from infection, or protracted delay to result. Understanding the human response across different pathogens on a clinical and molecular level can provide more accurate, timely, and useful answers, especially in critical illness and diagnostic uncertainty. Improvements in understanding the human immune response including genomics, protein analysis, gene expression, and cellular morphology have led to rapid innovation of new host response-based diagnostic tests. This review describes the limitations of pathogen-focused technology and the benefits of examining the breadth of immune response to diagnose infection. It then explores biomarkers that have been studied for this purpose and scrutinizes the performance of host-based multianalyte testing. Currently cleared diagnostics and those in late-stage development are described in depth, with a focus on the purpose of testing and its utility for clinicians. Finally, it concludes by examining opportunities for further host response-derived diagnostic innovation.","AbstractBackgroundVaccine hesitancy is increasingly recognized as a health challenge affecting populations worldwide. Given the biological vulnerabilities and structural barriers people who use substances and/or have behavioral addictions face, this systematic review aims to evaluate whether this subpopulation is less prone to adhere to vaccination recommendations.MethodsElectronic searches of published original research were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and PsycINFO from database inception to December 2022. Our strategy encompassed retrievals regardless of languages and date of publication. Animal studies, abstracts without a full manuscript, and studies which were considered to have lower robustness of scientific evidence were excluded. Outcomes measured were vaccine acceptance, uptake, and adherence. Results were interpreted through a narrative synthesis.ResultsThe search yielded 103 retrievals encompassing data collected on 5 576 374 persons who were predominantly residents of Europe (n = 39) and North America (n = 27). Tobacco use, the substance for which many studies were found (n = 91), was significantly associated with poorer vaccine acceptance, uptake and adherence for influenza, COVID-19, human papillomavirus (HPV), and maternal and childhood vaccines. Peri-natal and parental substance use was identified as a risk factor for suboptimal vaccine-related outcomes concerning maternal COVID-19 and childhood vaccines. Finally, people identified as ‘using’, ‘abusing’, or ‘misusing’ drugs or substances may be at decreased odds of all outcomes in various vaccines.ConclusionsCollectively, the studies identified several groups with statistically significant greater vaccine hesitancy and decreased engagement among whom targeted measures could be beneficial. Timely evidence, especially on behavioral addictions and substances besides tobacco, is lacking, and warrants urgent attention.",1
"Cell processing laboratories are an important part of cancer treatment centers. Cell processing laboratories began by supporting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation programs. These laboratories adapted closed bag systems, centrifuges, sterile connecting devices and other equipment used in transfusion services/blood banks to remove red blood cells and plasma from marrow and peripheral blood stem cells products. The success of cellular cancer immunotherapies such as Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells has increased the importance of cell processing laboratories. Since many of the diseases successfully treated by CAR T-cell therapy are also treated by HSC transplantation and since HSC transplantation teams are well suited to manage patients treated with CAR T-cells, many cell processing laboratories have begun to produce CAR T-cells. The methods that have been used to process HSCs have been modified for T-cell enrichment, culture, stimulation, transduction and expansion for CAR T-cell production. While processing laboratories are well suited to manufacture CAR T-cells and other cellular therapies, producing these therapies is challenging. The manufacture of cellular therapies requires specialized facilities which are costly to build and maintain. The supplies and reagents, especially vectors, can also be expensive. Finally, highly skilled staff are required. The use of automated equipment for cell production may reduce labor requirements and the cost of facilities. The steps used to produce CAR T-cells are reviewed, as well as various strategies for establishing a laboratory to manufacture these cells.","Heart failure and cancer remain 2 of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and the 2 disease entities are linked in a complex manner. Patients with cancer are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications related to the cancer therapies. The presence of cardiomyopathy or heart failure in a patient with new cancer diagnosis portends a high risk for adverse oncology and cardiovascular outcomes. With the rapid growth of cancer therapies, many of which interfere with cardiovascular homeostasis, heart failure practitioners need to be familiar with prevention, risk stratification, diagnosis, and management strategies in cardio-oncology.This Heart Failure Society of America statement addresses the complexities of heart failure care among patients with active cancer diagnoses and cancer survivors. Risk stratification, monitoring and management of cardiotoxicity are presented across stages A through D heart failure, with focused discussion on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and special populations, such as survivors of childhood and young-adulthood cancers. We provide an overview of the shared risk factors between cancer and heart failure, highlighting heart failure as a form of cardiotoxicity associated with many different cancer therapeutics. Finally, we discuss disparities in the care of patients with cancer and cardiac disease and present a framework for a multidisciplinary-team approach and critical collaboration among heart failure, oncology, palliative care, pharmacy, and nursing teams in the management of these complex patients.",0
"ABSTRACTThe protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7) is an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptor that has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for human tumors. PTK7 is a pseudokinase that is involved in the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway through interactions with other receptors. These interactions result in targeted gene activation that regulates cell polarity, migration, and proliferation during embryogenesis. Aside of this role during development, PTK7 has been shown as overexpressed in numerous cancers including colon carcinoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, hepatoma, and ovarian cancer. The activity of PTK7 and the direct correlation with poor prognosis have fostered preclinical investigations and phase I clinical trials, aiming at inhibiting PTK7 and inducing antitumoral effects. In this review, we provide an exhaustive overview of the diverse approaches that use PTK7 as a new molecular target for cancer therapy in different tumor types. We discuss current therapies and future strategies including chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, antibody-drug conjugates, aptamers, based on up-to-date literature and ongoing research progress.","The relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in brain cell types and subtypes remains under-studied. Here, we generated single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the neocortex of 424 individuals of advanced age; we assessed the effect of genetic variants on RNA expression in cis (cis-eQTL) for 7 cell types and 64 cell subtypes using 1.5 million transcriptomes. This effort identified 10,004 eGenes at the cell type level and 8,099 eGenes at the cell subtype level. Many eGenes are only detected within cell subtypes. A new variant influences APOE expression only in microglia and is associated with greater cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, after adjusting for APOEε4, providing mechanistic insights into both pathologies. Further, only a TMEM106B variant affects the proportion of cell subtypes.

"AbstractBackground:Durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) failed to bring survival benefits to patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in PACIFIC study (evaluating durvalumab in patients with stage III, unresectable NSCLC who did not have disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy). We aimed to explore whether locally advanced inoperable patients with EGFR mutations benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the optimal treatment regimen.Methods:We searched the PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to December 31, 2022 and performed a meta-analysis based on a Bayesian framework, with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoints.Results:A total of 1156 patients were identified in 16 studies that included 6 treatment measures, including CRT, CRT followed by durvalumab (CRT-Durva), TKI monotherapy, radiotherapy combined with TKI (RT-TKI), CRT combined with TKI (CRT-TKI), and TKI combined with durvalumab (TKI-Durva). The PFS of patients treated with TKI-containing regimens was significantly longer than that of patients treated with TKI-free regimens (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20–0.66). The PFS of TKI monotherapy was significantly longer than that of CRT (HR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.50–0.87) but shorter than RT-TKI (HR = 1.78, 95% CI, 1.17–2.67). Furthermore, the PFS of RT-TKI or CRT-TKI were both significantly longer than that of CRT or CRT-Durva. RT-TKI ranked first in the Bayesian ranking, with the longest OS (60.8 months, 95% CI = 37.2–84.3 months) and the longest PFS (21.5 months, 95% CI, 15.4–27.5 months) in integrated analysis.Conclusions:For unresectable stage III EGFR mutant NSCLC, RT and TKI are both essential. Based on the current evidence, RT-TKI brings a superior survival advantage, while CRT-TKI needs further estimation. Large randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to explore the appropriate application sequences of TKI, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.Registration:PROSPERO;  No. CRD42022298490.","Purpose The efficacy and lower neurotoxicity of normal brain-sparing radiotherapy (NBS-RT) with systemic therapy in treating multiple brain metastases from non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is underexplored. This study compares whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and NBS-RT for multiple brain metastases in NSCLC, focusing on treatment outcomes and leukoencephalopathy.Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 503 patients with NSCLC with multiple brain metastases at a single center, treated with either WBRT or NBS-RT. Post-RT treatments included chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Main outcomes measured were intracranial control, overall survival (OS), and leukoencephalopathy incidence.Results In this study, 441 patients received WBRT and 62 received NBS-RT, with median ages of 62 and 61 years, respectively. A significant portion of both groups, 77.3% in WBRT and 80.6% in NBS-RT, received post-RT systemic therapy. The median number of brain metastases was 10 for WBRT and 12 for NBS-RT, with median maximal diameters of 11.7 mm in WBRT and 14.4 mm in NBS-RT. After a median follow-up of 10.9 months for WBRT and 11.8 months for NBS-RT, there were no significant differences in intracranial progression (p=0.516) or OS (p=0.492) between the groups. However, WBRT patients had a higher incidence of leukoencephalopathy than NBS-RT patients (p=0.013).Conclusion NBS-RT combined with systemic therapy was as effective in treating multiple brain metastases as WBRT and was less toxic. NBS-RT-based strategies deserve further investigation in a prospective setting.",1
"A B S T R A C TBackground and aimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death. Multi-pathway combination therapy is used to treat HCC, and immunotherapy is also a routine part of treatment. As a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) actively participate in cancer progression through complex functions. However, because CAFs dynamically change during cancer development, most of the current treatment strategies targeting CAFs fail. We created a prognostic CAF marker gene signature (CAFMGS) to investigate the utility of CAFs as a prognostic factor and therapeutic target.MethodsGene Expression Omnibus (GEO) single-cell RNA sequencing (Sc-RNA-seq) data were analyzed to identify CAF marker genes in HCC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used as a training cohort to construct the CAFMGS model and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) dataset was used to validate the CAFMGS.ResultsMarker genes in the CAFMGS model were (0.0001-SPP1), (0.0084-VCX3A), (0.0015-HMGA1), (0.0082-PLOD2), and (0.0075-CACYBP). The CAFMGS_score was separated into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the median of the patients’ OS. Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed that CAFMGS_score was an independent prognostic factor in the training group. CAFMGS_score was a more accurate prognostic indicator compared with clinicopathological score and tumor mutational burden score.ConclusionCAFMGS offers a fresh perspective on stromal cell marker genes in HCC prognosis and expands our knowledge of CAF heterogeneity and functional diversity, perhaps paving the way for CAF-targeted immunotherapy in HCC patients.","BackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a rare solid malignancy with a poor prognosis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in tumorigenesis and progression. However, little is known about the role of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC.Methodsm6A-related lncRNAs were extracted by Pearson analysis, and then prognosis-related lncRNAs were filtered from the m6A-related lncRNAs by univariate Cox regression analysis. Based on the expression patterns of the prognosis-related lncRNAs, samples were classified into distinct clusters. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was used to construct a m6A-lncRNA-related prognostic signature for PC patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate the prognostic ability of the model.ResultsA total of 178 tumor and 4 normal samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database in our study. Based on the expression of 12 filtered prognosis-related lncRNAs, two distinct clusters were eventually identified; these clusters were characterized by differences in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and prognosis. A risk model comprising ten m6A-related lncRNAs was identified as an independent predictor of prognosis. ROC analysis revealed that this model had an acceptable prognostic value for PC patients. The prognostic signature was related to the TIME and the expression of critical immune checkpoint molecules.ConclusionThis study comprehensively assessed the expression pattern and prognostic value of m6A-related lncRNAs in PC. The different clusters correlated with distinct TIMEs and prognoses. The study also constructed a ten-gene signature prognostic model based on m6A-related lncRNAs, which showed good accuracy in predicting overall survival.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-03985-4.",1
"BackgroundAberrant glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications leading to heterogeneity in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to construct a risk prediction model based on glycosyltransferase to forecast the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in CRC patients.MethodsBased on the TCGA dataset and glycosyltransferase genes, the NMF algorithm and WGCNA were used to identify molecular subtypes and co-expressed genes, respectively. Lasso and multivariate COX regression were used to identify prognostic glycosyltransferase genes and construct a glyco-risk prediction model in CRC patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression, Kaplan–Meier, and ROC curves were applied to further verify the prognostic performance of the model in CRC patients in the training and validation sets. We compared the responsiveness of immunotherapy and chemotherapy between the two groups. In vitro experiments and clinical specimens verified the specific function of the key glycosyltransferase genes in CRC.ResultsThe CRC cohort was divided into two subtypes with prominent differences in survival based on the well-robust seven-gene glyco-risk prediction model (composed of ALG1L2, HAS1, PYGL, COLGALT2, B3GNT4, POFUT2, and GALNT7). The nomograms based on the risk model could predict the prognosis of CRC patients independently of other clinicopathologic characteristics. Our prediction model showed a better overall prediction performance than other models. Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk CRC patients showed a lower immune infiltration state, but a higher TMB and a lower response to anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Clinical specimen validation showed an obvious difference in the expression of seven glycosyltransferase genes between the low- and high-risk groups. Significant reduction in POFUT2 expression in high-risk groups was associated with reduced N-glycans production.ConclusionOur study constructed a robust glyco-risk prediction model that could provide direction for immunotherapy and chemotherapy in CRC patients, which could help clinicians make personalized treatment decisions.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04626-0.","IntoductionBladder cancer is the second most common urinary tract cancer. Above 70% of the occurrence of bladder cancer is superficial (pTis, pTa, and pT1), non-muscle invasive tumor (NMIBC), and the incidence of invasive disease is occasional. Treatments for NMIBC consist of transurethral resection (TUR) and subsequently intravesical immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), intending to prevent tumor progression and decrease recurrence. However, 20–30% of these tumors have progression, and 70% have a recurrence after exclusive TUR treatment. The immunomodulator of biological response, OncoTherad®, is an attractive potential to revolutionize cancer therapy. In our previous studies with mice, the results showed that treatment with OncoTherad® reduced 100% of tumor progression in NMIBC through the activation of Toll-Like Receptors’ non-canonical pathway.Materials and Methods In the present study, 36 female C57Bl/6J mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 6/group): Control, Cancer, Cancer + BCG, Cancer + OncoTherad® (MRB-CFI-1), Cancer + P14-16 and Cancer + CFI-1. NMIBC was chemically induced and the treatments were followed for 6 weeks. A week after the last dose of treatment, animals were euthanized, the bladder was collected and routinely processed for immunohistochemical analyses of RANK, RANKL, FOXP3, and PD-1/PD-L1, such as PD-1/PD-L1 western blotting.ConclusionThe immunohistochemical results showed that OncoTherad® reduced RANK and RANKL immunoreactivities compared to the cancer group, which indicates a good prognosis. Immunohistochemical and western blotting analyses confirmed that OncoTherad® modulated PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint.",1
"ObjectiveOvarian cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest mortality rate in the female reproductive system, enormous socio-economic burden, and limited effective drug therapy. There is an urgent need to find novel effective drugs for ovarian cancer therapy. Our previous in vitro studies demonstrate that ivermectin effectively inhibits ovarian cancer cells and affects energy metabolism pathways. This study aims to clarify in vivo mechanisms and therapeutic targets of ivermectin in the treatment of ovarian cancer to establish predictive biomarkers, guide personalized treatments, and improve preventive strategies in the framework of 3P medicine.MethodsA TOV-21G tumor-bearing mouse model was constructed based on histopathological data and biochemical parameters. TMT-based proteomic analysis was performed on tumor tissues from the different treatment groups. All significantly differentially abundant proteins were characterized by hierarchical clustering, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. In addition, the data were integrated and analyzed with the proteomic data of clinical ovarian cancer tissues from our previous study and the proteomic data of ivermectin intervention in ovarian cancer cells to identify key regulators of ivermectin.ResultsIvermectin (10 mg/kg) had a significant anti-ovarian cancer effect in mice, with a tumor inhibitory rate of 61.5%. Molecular changes in tumor tissue of ivermectin-treated mice were established, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis showed that the main differential pathway networks included the TCA cycle, propanoate metabolism, 2-0xocarboxyacid metabolism, and other pathways. Integrating our previous clinical ovarian cancer tissue and cell experimental data, this study found that ivermectin significantly interfered with the energy metabolic pathways of ovarian cancer, including glycolysis, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and other related pathways.ConclusionsThis study evaluated the anti-ovarian cancer effect in vitro and in vivo, and its specific regulatory effect on energy metabolism. The expressions of drug target molecules in the energy metabolism pathway of ovarian cancer will be used to guide the diagnosis and prevention of ovarian cancer. The significant efficacy of ivermectin will be applied to the treatment of ovarian cancer and personalized medication. This has guiding significance for the clinical diagnosis, treatment, personalized medication, and prognosis evaluation of ovarian cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-024-00385-1.","PurposeThere is not much progress in the treatment for lung squamous cell carcinoma LSCC in the past few years. Rapamycin Rapa, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR, has exhibited antitumor efficacy in a variety of malignant tumors. It has recently been reported that Rapamycin can induce autophagy signaling pathway in lung cancer and Glypican-3GPC3 can promote the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by stimulating canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of rapamycin’s antitumor efficacy in relation to GPC3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy in LSCC.MethodsSK-MES-1 cells, a LSCC cell line, were treated with various concentrations of rapamycin with or without Glypican-3 GPC3-targeting siRNA. SK-MES-1 cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Protein expression levels of GPC3, β-catenin, Beclin-1 were checked via western blotting. We established the xenograft mice model to investigate the suppression effect of rapamycin on LSCC. In addition, we further testified the metabolism protein of autophagy process using the xenograft tumor tissue. ResultsRapamycin could inhibit the SK-MES-1 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the GPC3 expression and downregulating the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we found that GPC3 silencing can activate the glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin pathway and autophagy, which contribute to the suppression of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionRapamycin suppresses the growth of lung cancer through down-regulating glypican-3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which mediates with activation of autophagy. This study suggests GPC3 is a new promising target for rapamycin in the treatment of lung cancer.",1
"ABSTRACTAs COVID-19 is the third coronavirus epidemic in this century, it would be desirable to have a treatment scheme in anticipation of a fourth one. We here present a scheme that could clear SARS-CoV-2 in 2–4 days post-infection from the upper respiratory tract (URT), where the virions are initially concentrated. The scheme, applicable on a large scale by nasal spray, is based on homoharringtonine (HHT), which has been approved for treating other diseases. HHT blocked protein elongation and repressed in vitro replication of all four coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) that were tested at the nano-molar concentration, demonstrating its potential for broad effectiveness against coronaviruses. In animal models, HHT cleared SARS-CoV-2 in all treated mice within 3 days by daily nasal dripping of a small dose (40 μg). In December 2022, HHT was administered to 26 cancer patients by nebulization at 1 mg/day. On average, the viral load in the URT was reduced by three-quarters 6 hours after the nebulization. In the wavelet of May 2023, 11 patients without other medical conditions were administered HHT by repeated liquid nasal spray at the low total daily dose of 0.2 mg. Ten of the 11 patients were cleared of the virus in 2–4 days. In comparison, in large-cohort studies of participants in China during the same wave, most patients need 7–9 days to turn negative. No adverse effects were detected in any patient in the two clinical trials. A short review of drugs approved for treating COVID-19 shows the many advantages of HHT. With continual development, it could become a first-line defense at the onset of future coronavirus epidemics.","PurposePoly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), a synthetic polymer known for its hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, has long been used in drug delivery systems to prevent non-specific protein adsorption and to extend the blood circulation time of drug carriers and protein drugs. However, PEG has several drawbacks including poor stability, accumulated toxicity, and immunogenicity induced by repeated injections. Recently, zwitterionic polymers, known for their super-hydrophilic and antifouling properties, have been considered excellent alternatives to PEG. In this study, we synthesized a new zwitterionic polymer from biocompatible sodium alginate and lysine.MethodsSodium alginate (Alg) was conjugated with lysine (Lys) using the EDC/sulfo-NHS chemistry to form a zwitterionic alginate derivative (Alg-Lys). The biocompatibility was evaluated using in vitro cellular assays and in vivo animal studies. After further conjugation of zwitterionic near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye ZW800, an in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging study was conducted to evaluate the ability of Alg-Lys to enhance blood circulation time.ResultsCharacterization of Alg-Lys showed that the carboxylic acid groups in Alg were completely replaced by Lys molecules. No cytotoxic effects were observed in the in vitro cytotoxicity tests of Alg-Lys-treated cancer cells and normal cells. Serum biochemical analysis confirmed the biocompatibility of Alg-Lys. ZW800-conjugated Alg-Lys exhibited strong fluorescence signals throughout the body 24 h after intravenous injection, whereas ZW800-conjugated Alg was rapidly removed from the body.ConclusionThe zwitterionic alginate derivative showed potential utility as a new delivery platform for imaging agents and drugs.",0
"The crucial role of steroid hormones in health and diseases merits their high-throughput, accurate and affordable measurements in biological specimens. Despite advances in analytical methods, sensing and quantifying steroid hormones remains challenging. Immunoassays offer excellent sensitivity but are inherently labour-intensive, costly, and prone to false positives. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been increasingly utilised, with the main hurdle being the isobaric tendencies of similar analytes, which complicates their separation and accurate quantification. This study compares ultrahigh-performance supercritical fluid chromatography separation (UHPSFC) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) for MS detection. It optimises the column chemistry, temperature, and pressure to provide an operational protocol for the resolution and quantification of analytes. It presents the systematic characterisation of UHPSFC-MS performance by investigating spiked blood samples using Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) and describes the matrix effects associated with MS measurements. Although both separation methods showed adequate resolution, specificity, and retention time, UHPSFC-MS was superior for five out of seven columns tested. With added high-throughput capacities, UHPSFC-MS, thus, offers an optimal solution for the analysis of steroid hormones for research, medical chemistry, and clinical diagnostics.","Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) based liquid kidney biopsies have the potential to detect the chances of kidney transplant rejection. Several studies have found that dd-cfDNA can be used to determine the risk of kidney transplant rejection and may correlate with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A high concentration of dd-cfDNA in the body fluids may indicate possible transplant rejection since dd-cfDNA is released as a result of apoptotic and necrotic processes initiated by the recipient’s immune system. dd-cfDNA assays have advantages over conventional biopsies since they are noninvasive, and therefore, have the potential to provide a safe and reliable biomarker. Different dd-cfDNA levels have been reported above a number of cutoff thresholds: ABMR at 2.45% and TCMR at 1.3%, compared with 0.44% in healthy patients; and eGFR at 2.5%, a decrease of 25% compared with healthy patients. These results indicate the levels of dd-cfDNA that may be used to signal possible kidney rejection. dd-cfDNA assay is a rapid technique, making it particularly useful in emergencies, and further research into its use in the study of kidney rejection should prove beneficial.",1
"PurposeWe aimed to assess the predictive value of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) therapy using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted at Seoul National University Hospital. Patients with EGFR/ALK-wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received ICBs between December 2013 and December 2019 were enrolled. Patients with archived blood samples collected prior to ICB treatment were assigned to the ELISA cohort. In addition, those with tissue samples from sites of recurrence or metastasis were assigned to an IHC cohort. Then, we analyzed Gal-3 expression in both cohorts.ResultsFifty-six patients in the ELISA cohort were grouped into low (N = 36) and high (N = 20) groups, using the mean Gal-3 ELISA level (13.24 pg/ml) as a cutoff. The high group demonstrated trends toward reduced progression-free survival (PFS) (0.9 vs. 3.7 months, p = 0.196) and significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (1.6 vs. 12.3 months, p = 0.018) than the low group. We categorized 94 patients in the IHC cohort into negative (N = 31) and positive (N = 63) groups based on Gal-3 IHC positivity. However, the median PFS (4.6 vs. 4.6 months for the negative vs. positive IHC group, respectively, p = 0.345) and OS (16.4 vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.137) were not significantly different.ConclusionHigh blood Gal-3 levels may predict inferior survival in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with ICBs.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04275-9.","BackgroundCD177, an indicator of prognosis in diverse cancers, is involved in the physiological processes of various tumor cells, and acts as an immune molecule with novel functions in cancer pathogenesis. However, the diagnostic, prognostic, and immunological role of CD177 in cervical cancer remains unclear.MethodsUtilizing publicly available databases and integrating several bioinformatics analysis methods, we evaluated the expression level of CD177 in cervical cancer by GENT2, HPA, and GEO databases. And the experiments of western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to test the hypothesis. The Kaplan–Meier Plotter database, Xena Shiny, and the constructed nomogram were clearly demonstrated its prognostic value for patients. Gene set enrichment analysis explored the relationship between CD177 and cervical cancer immune responses and immune cells infiltration level. In addition, we investigated the association between CD177 expression and stromal score, immune score, immune checkpoint, and drug sensitivity by TCGA RNA-seq data.ResultsCD177 was apparently expressed at low levels in cervical cancer and predicted a poor survival rate for patients. CD177 significantly activated immune-related signaling pathways and had a positive relationship with immune cell infiltration level. The high CD177 expression group possessed the high stromal score and immune score. CD177 had potential interactions with CTLA4, CD27, BLTA, CD200R1, CD80, NRP1, TNFRSF25, TIGIT, ICOS, and TNFSF9 checkpoint markers. And CD177 expression was positively relevant with drug sensitivity for Lapatinib, Belinostat, ATRA, Gefitinib, Navitoclax, and Tamoxifen.SignificanceThese findings may shed light on the vital role of CD177 in cervical cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and immunological functions, and it may be a promising predictor and potential factor for cervical cancer patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04465-5.",1
"AbstractAimsColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide. Accurate pathological diagnosis and predictive abilities for treatment response and prognosis are crucial for patients with CRC. This study aims to analyse the expressions of p21 and EGFR in CRC and their relationships with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis to enhance diagnostic and prognostic evaluations.MethodsThis study conducted a retrospective analysis of p21 and EGFR expressions in 12 319 Chinese patients with CRC using immunohistochemistry. The relationships between these expressions and clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes were explored through statistical and survival analyses.ResultsDifferential expressions of p21 and EGFR in CRC were closely related to clinicopathological characteristics and significantly impacted overall survival (OS). p21 expression was associated with the primary tumour site, mucinous subtype, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, circumferential resection margin, T stage, N stage, tumour, node, metastases (TNM) stage, and mismatch repair status. EGFR expression was related to mucinous subtype, tumour differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, tumour size, T stage, N stage, TNM stage and BRAF gene mutation. p21 and EGFR expressions were positively correlated (r=0.11). High p21 expression correlated with favourable OS, whereas high EGFR expression predicted poorer OS. A prognostic nomogram incorporating these biomarkers and clinical variables demonstrated robust predictive power for patient survival rates.Conclusionp21 and EGFR serve as potential indicators for pathological diagnosis, risk stratification, and predicting treatment efficacy and prognosis in patients with CRC. The study’s findings provide valuable references for personalised treatment and prognosis evaluation in clinical practice.","AbstractBackgroundBiosimilars are products containing an approved biological medicine. They are similar, but not identical, to an originator medicine. In cancer, biosimilars have been developed from the monoclonal antibodies, bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab. They have become available for the treatment of lung, colorectal, non‐Hodkin's lymphoma, and breast cancers. As these biological products are not identical, synthesis of evidence of the clinical effects of biosimilars compared to their originators is needed to understand their comparative effectiveness and harms.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies versus their originator drugs for adults with cancer.Search methodsWe searched bibliographic (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) and clinical trials databases to February 2024.Selection criteriaWe included head‐to‐head randomised controlled trials conducted in adults with cancer treated with biosimilar or originator monoclonal antibodies.Data collection and analysisWe followed standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, breast cancer's pathological complete response, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. If survival estimates were adjusted or provided as rates, we did not combine them. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias and GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence of critical and important outcomes according to the relevance determined by consumers.Main resultsWe included 55 studies with 22,046 adults (23 of bevacizumab, 10,639 participants with colorectal or lung cancer; 17 of rituximab, 4412 participants with non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 15 of trastuzumab, 6995 participants with breast cancer). Studies were conducted in all continents, most were multicentre, and all were funded by the drug manufacturer. Participants' ages ranged from 47 (mean) to 62 (median) years and the proportion of women from 18% to 100%. Fifteen studies were conducted as non‐inferiority and 40 as equivalence. The overall risk of bias was low; main biases were in the incomplete outcome data and selective reporting domains.Bevacizumab biosimilar versus bevacizumab originator in lung or colorectal cancerProgression‐free survival is likely similar between bevacizumab biosimilar and the originator (per 1000: 380 in both groups at 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 5 studies, 2660 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancer subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in duration of response (per 1000: 219 participants who achieved response progressed with biosimilar versus 210 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37; 1 study, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and overall survival (per 1000: 592 with biosimilar versus 610 with originator at 12 months; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19; 5 studies, 2783 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in cancer type subgroups.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to the originator in serious adverse events (per 1000: 303 with biosimilar versus 309 with originator; risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 23 studies, 10,619 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Bevacizumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in health‐related quality of life as scores were comparable in the one study that assessed this outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (low‐certainty evidence). This critical outcome was not assessed in other biosimilars comparisons.Bevacizumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in objective response (per 1000: 481 with biosimilar versus 501 with originator; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; 23 studies, 10,054 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and mortality (per 1000: 287 with biosimilar versus 279 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 19 studies, 9231 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in lung or colorectal cancers.Rituximab biosimilar versus rituximab originator in non‐Hodgkin's lymphomaRituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (7 studies, 2456 participants), duration of response (2 studies, 522 participants), and overall survival (7 studies, 2353 participants; data not pooled as survival estimates were adjusted for different factors or reported as rates) (all moderate‐certainty evidence).Rituximab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in the risk of serious adverse events (per 1000: 210 with biosimilar versus 204 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14; 15 studies, 4197 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and objective response (per 1000: 807 with biosimilar versus 799 with originator; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 16 studies, 3922 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.Rituximab biosimilar is similar to originator in mortality (per 1000: 52 with biosimilar versus 53 with originator; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; 8 studies, 2557 participants; high‐certainty evidence).Trastuzumab biosimilar versus trastuzumab originator in breast cancerTrastuzumab biosimilar is likely similar to originator in progression‐free survival (4 studies, 2221 participants), duration of response (3 studies, 1488 participants), and overall survival (6 studies, 2221 participants), which were not pooled due to adjustment for different factors or provided as rates. No study reported quality of life.Trastuzumab biosimilar may be similar to originator in pathological complete response (per 1000: 459 with biosimilar versus 433 with originator; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 7 studies, 3403 participants; low‐certainty evidence), is likely similar in serious adverse events (per 1000: 129 in both groups; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; 13 studies, 6183 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and slightly increases objective response (per 1000: 801 with biosimilar versus 777 with originator; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; 13 studies, 5509 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsTreatment with bevacizumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab biosimilars are likely similar to their originator drugs in terms of their impact on progression‐free survival, duration of response, overall survival, serious adverse events, objective response, and mortality. Limited evidence showed similarity in pathological complete response for trastuzumab and quality of life for bevacizumab compared with originators, which was not assessed in the other comparisons. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate and imprecision was the main reason for downgrading our certainty in the findings.",1
"B-cell lymphomas occur with an incidence of 20 new cases per 100.000 per year in the Western world. They may affect any organ and are characterized by heterogeneous clinical presentations and courses, varying from asymptomatic, indolent to very aggressive cases. Since this topic was last reviewed in The Lancet in 2017, a deeper understanding of the biological background of this heterogeneous group of malignancies, the availability of new diagnostic methods and the development and implementation of new targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches have improved our ability to manage patients. This review provides an overview of pathobiology, classification and prognostication of B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas and summarizes the current knowledge and standard of care regarding biology and clinical management of the most common subtypes of mature B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, highlighting new findings in deciphering the molecular background of disease development and the implementation of new therapeutic approaches especially targeting the immunosystem.","Bispecific antibodies are an important tool for the management and treatment of acute leukemias. As a next step toward clinical translation of engineered plasma cells, we describe approaches for secretion of bispecific antibodies by human plasma cells. We show that human plasma cells expressing either fragment crystallizable domain-deficient anti-CD19 × anti-CD3 (blinatumomab) or anti-CD33 × anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies mediate T cell activation and direct T cell killing of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro. We demonstrate that knockout of the self-expressed antigen, CD19, boosts anti-CD19-bispecific secretion by plasma cells and prevents self-targeting. Plasma cells secreting anti-CD19-bispecific antibodies elicited in vivo control of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived xenografts in immunodeficient mice co-engrafted with autologous T cells. In these studies, we found that leukemic control elicited by engineered plasma cells was similar to CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells. Finally, the steady-state concentration of anti-CD19 bispecifics in serum 1 month after cell delivery and tumor eradication was comparable with that observed in patients treated with a steady-state infusion of blinatumomab. These findings support further development of ePCs for use as a durable delivery system for the treatment of acute leukemias, and potentially other cancers.",0
"BackgroundGliomas, originating from glial cells within the brain or spinal cord, are common central nervous system tumors with varying degrees of malignancy that influence the complexity and difficulty of treatment. The current strategies, including traditional surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and emerging immunotherapies, have yielded limited results. As such, our study aims to optimize risk stratification for a more precise treatment approach. We primarily identify feature genes associated with poor immune cell infiltration patterns through various omics algorithms and categorize glioma patients based on these genes to enhance the accuracy of patient prognosis assessment. This approach can underpin individualized treatment strategies and facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic targets.MethodsWe procured datasets of gliomas and normal brain tissues from TCGA, CGGA, and GTEx databases. Clustering was conducted using the input of 287 immune cell feature genes. Hub genes linked with the poor prognosis subtype (C1) were filtered through WGCNA. The TCGA dataset served as the discovery cohort and the CGGA dataset as the external validation cohort. We constructed a prognostic model related to feature genes from poor immune cell infiltration patterns utilizing LASSO-Cox regression. Comprehensive analyses of genomic heterogeneity, tumor stemness, pathway relevance, immune infiltration patterns, treatment response, and potential drugs were conducted for different risk groups. Gene expression validation was performed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 98 glioma samples and 11 normal brain tissue samples.ResultsUsing the filtered immune cell-related genes, glioma patients were stratified into C1 and C2 subtypes through clustering. The C1 subtype exhibited a worse prognosis, with upregulated genes primarily enriched in immune response, extracellular matrix, etc., and downregulated genes predominantly enriched in neural signal transduction and neural pathway-related aspects. Seven advanced algorithms were used to elucidate immune cell infiltration patterns of different subtypes. In addition, WGCNA identified hub genes from poor immune infiltration patterns, and a prognostic model was constructed accordingly. High-risk patients demonstrated shorter survival times and higher risk scores as compared to low-risk patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that, after adjusting for confounding clinical factors, risk score was a vital independent predictor of overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001). The established nomogram, which combined risk scores with WHO grade and age, accurately predicted glioma patient survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years, with AUCs of 0.908, 0.890, and 0.812, respectively. This risk score enhanced the nomogram's reliability and informed clinical decision-making. We also comprehensively analyzed genomic heterogeneity, tumor stemness, pathway relevance, immune infiltration patterns, treatment response, and potential drugs for different risk groups. In addition, we conducted preliminary validation of the potential PLSCR1 gene using IHC with a large sample of gliomas and normal brain tissues.ConclusionOur optimized risk stratification strategy for glioma patients has the potential to improve the accuracy of prognosis assessment. The findings from our omics research not only enhance the understanding of the functions of feature genes related to poor immune cell infiltration patterns but also offer valuable insights for the study of glioma prognostic biomarkers and the development of individualized treatment strategies.Graphical abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05209-9.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody are promising treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but lack reliable biomarkers of response. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between pre-treatment body composition measures (muscle, adipose, etc.) and the prognosis of patients with HCC treated with ICIs.MethodsWe measured the total area of all skeletal muscles, total adipose tissue area, subcutaneous adipose tissue area, and visceral adipose tissue area at the level of the third lumbar vertebra using quantitative CT. Then, we calculated the skeletal muscle index, visceral adipose tissue index, subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI), and total adipose tissue index. The Cox regression model was used to determine the independent factors of the patient prognosis and construct a nomogram to predict survival. The consistency index (C-index) and calibration curve were used to determine the predictive accuracy and discrimination ability of the nomogram.ResultsMultivariate analysis revealed that the SATI (high- vs. low SATI; HR 0.251; 95% CI 0.109–0.577; P = 0.001), sarcopenia (sarcopenia vs. no sarcopenia; HR 2.171; 95% CI 1.100–4.284; P = 0.026), and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) (PVTT vs. No PVTT; HR 2.429; 95% CI 1. 197–4. 929; P = 0.014) were indicated as independent prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis indicated that Child–Pugh class (HR 0.477, 95% CI 0.257–0.885, P = 0.019) and sarcopenia (HR 2.376, 95% CI 1.335–4.230, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors of PFS. We established a nomogram using SATI, SA, and PVTT to predict the 12-month and 18-month survival probability of HCC patients treated with ICIs. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.754 (95% CI 0.686–0.823), and the calibration curve confirmed that the predicted results were in good agreement with the actual observations.ConclusionSubcutaneous adipose and sarcopenia are significant prognostic factors of patients with HCC receiving ICIs. A nomogram based on body composition parameters and clinical factors could well predict survival in HCC patients treated with ICIs.",1
"Introduction:The cell cycle cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a critical role in controlling the transition between cell cycle phases, as well as cellular transcription. Aberrant CDK activation is common in cancer, and deregulation of the cell cycle a key hallmark of cancer. Although CDK4/6 inhibitors are now a standard-of-care option for first- and second-line HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, resistance inevitably limits their clinical benefit.Areas covered:Early pan-CDK inhibitors targeted the cell cycle and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, but were complicated by toxicity, providing a rationale and need for the development of selective CDK inhibitors. In this review, we highlight selected recent literature to provide a narrative review summarizing the current CDK inhibitor therapeutic landscape. We detail the challenges associated with targeting CDKs for the treatment of breast and other cancers and review emerging biomarkers that may aid response prediction. We also discuss the risk-benefit ratio for CDK therapy and explore promising combination approaches.Expert opinion:Although CDK inhibitors may stem the proliferation of cancer cells, resistance remains an issue, and currently there are limited biomarkers to predict response to therapy. Ongoing research investigating CDK inhibitors in cancer is of paramount importance to define appropriate and effective treatment regimens.","A larger percentage of our population is aging healthily and living on to a ripe old age. 60 years of age is taken as cut-off for identifying geriatric population for the purpose of specialized healthcare. The incidence of cancer is increasing and its expected more so in the geriatric population. At present , there are a limited cancer centres where specialized geriatric clinic is being conducted.Some of the the key unmet needs are — lack of resources and time for dedicated geriatric screening, lack of validated interventions and lack of awareness about the field of geriatric oncology. Some of the proposed solutions are increasing orientation and exposure of trainees and early career oncologists as well as carrying out country specific research to find useful interventions in this field.",1
"ABSTRACTMillions of people worldwide suffer from cancer, facing challenges such as treatments affecting healthy cells, suboptimal responses, adverse effects, recurrence risk, drug resistance, and nonspecific targeting. Chemoresistance leads to fatalities, but phytoactives show promise in cancer management despite limitations such as high metabolism, poor absorption, and high dosage requirements. Challenges in the large-scale isolation of phytoactive compounds, solubility, bioavailability, and targeting limit their development. Recent developments, including carbohydrate, lipid, and protein-based nanoparticles, have enhanced cancer treatment by improving the bioavailability and targeted delivery of phytoactives such as polyphenols, alkaloids, sulfur-containing compounds, flavonoids, and terpenes. Despite advancements, clinical application faces hurdles such as poor bioavailability and inconsistent immune responses. This article discusses the promise of phytoactive-loaded nanoformulations in cancer management, highlighting targeted drug delivery, unmet needs, and challenges. Further research is needed to overcome these challenges and fully understand the potential of phytoactives in cancer management.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematologic malignancy. Chemotherapy resistance results in a dismal survival rate of 1–2 years in older adults with AML. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently required. In this context, microRNA (miRNA)-based treatments remain an untapped strategy in AML. Using patient-derived specimens, we found increased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of older adults with AML, and decreased miR-497-5p in CD34+ leukemic blasts. Target prediction revealed that miR-497-5p could directly target mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAP2K1) mRNA to indirectly target cytokines and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway through the p38-MAPK signaling pathway, potentially inhibiting leukemic growth and overcoming chemoresistance from venetoclax. To improve miRNA delivery and minimize off-target effects, which represent key barriers to clinical translation, we developed liposomes for co-delivery of miR-497-5p and venetoclax. We decorated our liposomes with a peptide targeting CLL1, which is present on 92% of leukemia blasts while being absent in normal hematopoietic cells. This targeted approach demonstrated high efficacy in inhibiting AML growth in mice with minimal toxicity, as well as reduced exposure to chemoresistance. Our findings suggested that anti-CLL1-decorated, miR-497-5p, and venetoclax-loaded liposomes represent a promising novel miRNA-based therapeutic, which should be investigated further as a strategy to reduce venetoclax resistance in AML.",1
"IntroductionIn RCC, systematic procedures such as surgery, chemo-radiation therapy, and application of target-based inhibitors increase the risk of several comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest that may increase the mortality rate. Even though immune-based checkpoint inhibitor therapies have an overall good response rate, it is restricted to only 30–40% of patients. Hence, an in-depth study of tumor pathophysiology in RCC is needed to identify the new therapeutic target. In RCC, persisted hypoxia is an essential phenomenon for tumor growth and progression. KCMF1 is a newly identified ubiquitin ligase whose domain interacts with destabilized proteins and reprogrammed the ubiquitin coding for lysosome-mediated degradation and autophagy under hypoxic conditions/oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis. But in RCC, the functional role of KCMF1 remains undefined to date. MethodWe determined KCMF1 and its associated proteins RAD6 and UBR4 expression and their co-localization using confocal microscopy in tumor and non-tumor tissues samples. Further, immunofluorescence staining was performed to determine autophagy (LC3B, p62), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1A) and ion channel markers (Kv1.3, KCNN4) in RCC patients (n−10). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICPMS) was performed to estimate the concentration of potassium (K+), sodium (Na+) and Zinc (zn2+) in tumor and non-tumor cells of RCC patients (n−20). Lastly, images were analyzed using ZEN3.1, and ImageJ software.Result and conclusionWe observed a discrepancy in the formation of ubiquitin ligase, autophagosome via KCMF1, and ionic concentration in tumor cells, which might be one of the possible factors for cancer evolution. KCMF1-associated ubiquitin ligase system could be considered as a novel therapeutic target for RCC in the future.","Background:Compared to adult cancers, pediatric cancers are uniquely characterized by a genomically stable landscape and lower tumor mutational burden. However, alternative splicing, a global cellular process that produces different mRNA/protein isoforms from a single mRNA transcript, has been increasingly implicated in the development of pediatric cancers.Design:We review the current literature on the role of alternative splicing in adult cancer, cancer predisposition syndromes, and pediatric cancers. We also describe multiple splice variants identified in adult cancers and confirmed through comprehensive genomic profiling in our institutional cohort of rare, refractory and relapsed pediatric and adolescent young adult cancer patients. Finally, we summarize the contributions of alternative splicing events to neoantigens and chemoresistance and prospects for splicing-based therapies.Results:Published dysregulated splicing events can be categorized as exon inclusion, exon exclusion, splicing factor upregulation, or splice site alterations. We observe these phenomena in cancer predisposition syndromes (Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, CHEK2) and pediatric leukemia (B-ALL), sarcomas (Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma), retinoblastoma, Wilms tumor, and neuroblastoma. Within our institutional cohort, we demonstrate splice variants in key regulatory genes (CHEK2, TP53, PIK3R1, MDM2, KDM6A, NF1) that resulted in exon exclusion or splice site alterations, which were predicted to impact functional protein expression and promote tumorigenesis. Differentially spliced isoforms and splicing proteins also impact neoantigen creation and treatment resistance, such as imatinib or glucocorticoid regimens. Additionally, splice-altering strategies with the potential to change the therapeutic landscape of pediatric cancers include antisense oligonucleotides, adeno-associated virus gene transfers, and small molecule inhibitors.Conclusions:Alternative splicing plays a critical role in the formation and growth of pediatric cancers, and our institutional cohort confirms and highlights the broad spectrum of affected genes in a variety of cancers. Further studies that elucidate the mechanisms of disease-inducing splicing events will contribute toward the development of novel therapeutics.",0
"PurposeProgrammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) are immunosuppressive proteins known to be associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. However, their expression and clinical relevance in osteosarcoma remain unknown. In this study, the relationships of PD-L1 and IDO1 expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis were explored.MethodsThe expression of PD-L1, IDO1, CD3, CD4, and CD8 in 112 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues collected by biopsy or surgical resection from 56 osteosarcoma patients was evaluated immunohistochemically. Moreover, four osteosarcoma cell lines were evaluated for the effects of IFNγ on PD-L1 and IDO1 mRNA expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.ResultsIn pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) primary specimens, 10 cases (17%) showed PD-L1 expression and 12 (21%) showed IDO1 expression. Six of ten cases (60%) with PD-L1 positivity co-expressed IDO1. In post-NAC metastatic lesions, the frequency of immunoexpression of PD-L1 and IDO1 was increased compared with that in pre-NAC specimens. PD-L1 and/or IDO1 expression was not associated with poor prognosis. PD-L1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells; while, IDO1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with the infiltration of CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T cells. In all osteosarcoma cell lines, PD-L1 and IDO1 expression was upregulated by stimulation with IFNγ.ConclusionOur results suggest that the PD-L1 and IDO1 immune checkpoint inhibitors may provide clinical benefit in osteosarcoma patients with metastatic lesions after conventional chemotherapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03242-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","BackgroundOsteosarcoma is a common primary malignant tumour of the bone that usually occurs in children and adolescents. It is characterised by difficult treatment, recurrence and metastasis, and poor prognosis. Currently, the treatment of osteosarcoma is mainly based on surgery and auxiliary chemotherapy. However, for recurrent and some primary osteosarcoma cases, owing to the rapid progression of disease and chemotherapy resistance, the effects of chemotherapy are poor. With the rapid development of tumour-targeted therapy, molecular-targeted therapy for osteosarcoma has shown promise.PurposeIn this paper, we review the molecular mechanisms, related targets, and clinical applications of targeted osteosarcoma therapy. In doing this, we provide a summary of recent literature on the characteristics of targeted osteosarcoma therapy, the advantages of its clinical application, and development of targeted therapy in future. We aim to provide new insights into the treatment of osteosarcoma.ConclusionTargeted therapy shows potential in the treatment of osteosarcoma and may offer an important means of precise and personalised treatment in the future, but drug resistance and adverse effects may limit its application.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in India. This review explores the epidemiological trends and the landscape of systemic therapy for HCC in the Indian context, acknowledging the recent shift in etiology from viral hepatitis to lifestyle-associated factors.A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, including data from the Global Cancer Observatory and the Indian Council of Medical Research, along with a critical analysis of various clinical trials. The article investigates systemic therapies in-depth, discussing their mechanisms, efficacy, and adaptation to Indian healthcare framework.Progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of ≤0.6 compared to sorafenib, overall survival of ∼16–19 months, and objective response rate of 20–30% are the defining thresholds for systemic therapy clinical trials. Systemic therapy for advanced HCC in India primarily involves the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, and cabozantinib, with sorafenib being the most commonly used drug for a long time. Monoclonal antibodies such as ramucirumab and bevacizumab and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, are expanding treatment horizons. Lenvatinib has emerged as a cost-effective alternative, and the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab has demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. Despite these advances, late-stage diagnosis and limited healthcare accessibility pose significant challenges, often relegating patients to palliative care.Addressing HCC in India demands an integrative approach that not only encompasses advancements in systemic therapy but also targets early detection and comprehensive care models. Future strategies should focus on enhancing awareness, screening for high-risk populations, and overcoming infrastructural disparities. Ensuring the judicious use of systemic therapies within the constraints of the Indian healthcare economy is crucial. Ultimately, a nuanced understanding of systemic therapeutic options and their optimal utilization will be pivotal in elevating the standard of HCC care in India.","Sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) are a prominent group of plant secondary metabolites predominantly found in the Asteraceae family and have multiple ecological roles and medicinal applications. This review describes the evolutionary and ecological significance of STLs, highlighting their roles in plant defence mechanisms against herbivory and as phytotoxins, alongside their function as environmental signalling molecules. We also cover the substantial role of STLs in medicine and their mode of action in health and disease. We discuss the biosynthetic pathways and the various modifications that make STLs one of the most diverse groups of metabolites. Finally, we discuss methods for identifying and predicting STL biosynthesis pathways.This article is part of the theme issue ‘The evolution of plant metabolism’.",0
"BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer with a significant impact on loss of life. In 2020, nearly 1.9 million new cases and over 9,35,000 deaths were reported. Numerous microbes that are abundant in the human gut benefit host physiology in many ways. Although the underlying mechanism is still unknown, their association appears to be crucial in the beginning and progression of CRC.SummaryDiet has a significant impact on the microbial composition and may increase the chance of getting CRC. Increasing evidence points to the gut microbiota as the primary initiator of colonic inflammation, which is connected to the development of colonic tumors. However, it is unclear how the microbiota contributes to the development of CRCs. Patients with CRC have been found to have dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, which can be identified by a decline in commensal bacterial species, such as those that produce butyrate, and a concurrent increase in harmful bacterial populations, such as opportunistic pathogens that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. We believe that using probiotics or altering the gut microbiota will likely be effective tools in the fight against CRC treatment.PurposeIn this review, we revisited the association between gut microbiota and colorectal cancer whether cause or effect. The various factors which influence gut microbiome in patients with CRC and possible mechanism in relation with development of CRC.ConclusionThe clinical significance of the intestinal microbiota may aid in the prevention and management of CRC.Graphical abstract","Purpose This study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes in the microbiome of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), focusing on the relationship between the microbiome and response to nCRT.Materials and Methods We conducted a longitudinal study involving 103 samples from 26 patients with LARC. Samples were collected from both the tumor and normal rectal tissues before and after nCRT. Diversity, taxonomic, and network analyses were performed to compare the microbiome profiles across different tissue types, pre- and post-nCRT time-points, and nCRT responses.Results Between the tumor and normal tissue samples, no differences in microbial diversity and composition were observed. However, when pre- and post-nCRT samples were compared, there was a significant decrease in diversity, along with notable changes in composition. Non-responders exhibited more extensive changes in their microbiome composition during nCRT, characterized by an increase in pathogenic microbes. Meanwhile, responders had relatively stable microbiome communities with more enriched butyrate-producing bacteria. Network analysis revealed distinct patterns of microbial interactions between responders and non-responders, where butyrate-producing bacteria formed strong networks in responders, while opportunistic pathogens formed strong networks in non-responders. A Bayesian network model for predicting the nCRT response was established, with butyrate-producing bacteria playing a major predictive role.Conclusion Our study demonstrated a significant association between the microbiome and nCRT response in LARC patients, leading to the development of a microbiome-based response-prediction model. These findings suggest potential applications of microbiome signatures for predicting and optimizing nCRT treatment in LARC patients.",1
"Dysregulation of gene amplification, cell-signaling–pathway transduction, epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, and protein interactions drives tumor-cell proliferation and invasion, while ion channels also play an important role in the generation and development of tumor cells. Overexpression of Ca2+-activated Cl- channel anoctamin 1 (ANO1) is shown in numerous cancer types and correlates with poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms involved in ANO1-mediated malignant cellular transformation and the role of ANO1 in tumor immunity remain unknown. In this review, we discuss recent studies to determine the role of ANO1 in tumorigenesis and provide novel insights into the role of ANO1 in the context of tumor immunity. Furthermore, we analyze the roles and potential mechanisms of ANO1 in different types of cancers, and provide novel notions for the role of ANO1 in the tumor microenvironment and for potential use of ANO1 in clinical applications. Our review shows that ANO1 is involved in tumor immunity and microenvironment, and may, therefore, be an effective biomarker and therapeutic drug target.","AbstractBackgroundUsing immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO) is a promising approach to maximize clinical benefits for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-L1 expression serves as a predictive factor for treatment outcomes with IO. However, the high cost of this treatment creates significant barriers to access. Substantial evidence demonstrates the sustained clinical benefits experienced by patients who respond to immunotherapy. While IOs show promise in NSCLC treatment, their high cost poses access barriers.AimThis study focused on a prospective cost analysis conducted at a high-specialty health facility to assess the economic implications of implementing a risk-sharing agreement (RSA) for atezolizumab in NSCLC.MethodsThe study included 30 patients with advanced NSCLC, with the pharmaceutical company funding the initial cycles. If patients responded, a government program covered costs until disease progression.ResultsA median progression-free survival of 4.67 months across populations, rising to 9.4 months for responders. The 2-year overall survival rate for the response group was 64%, significantly higher than for non-response. Without an RSA, a total treatment cost of $881 859.36 ($29 395.31/patient) was reported, compared to $530 467.12 ($17 682.24/patient) with an RSA, representing a 40% cost reduction. In responders, the average cost per year of life per patient dropped by 22%. Risk-sharing, assessed through non-parametric tests, showed a statistically significant difference in pharmacological costs (P < .001).ConclusionImplementing RSAs can optimize resource allocation, making IO treatment more accessible, especially in low-income countries.",0
"The human body contains approximately 100 trillion microorganisms, predominantly within the gastrointestinal tract, collectively called the gut microbiota. Investigations have revealed the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain, characterized as the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" This axis represents an important regulator of brain development and function, immune system development, and nutrient metabolism, making it a target for efforts to alleviate the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Despite extensive biomedical and clinical research, our understanding of the causes, optimal treatment, and progression of NDDs remains limited. This paper aims to summarize the available knowledge on the role played by gut microbiota and how it is connected to the progression of neurodegenerative conditions; in particular, the relationship between the microbiota and gut-brain communications and the gut microbiota and neuro-immune conditions is reviewed. We discuss how and why the gut immune system communicates with the brain and how this communication impacts neurodegeneration. Next, we examine the alterations in the gut microbiota, immune response, and brain changes associated with gut dysbiosis. Finally, we highlight the preclinical and clinical evidence for probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, dietary supplements, natural drugs, and exercise intervention as potential therapeutic approaches that could lead to a new treatment paradigm for NDDs.","The precise prediction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complex structures is pivotal for understanding cellular immune responses and advancing vaccine design. In this study, we enhanced AlphaFold’s capabilities by fine-tuning it with a specialized dataset consisting of exclusively high-resolution class I MHC-peptide crystal structures. This tailored approach aimed to address the generalist nature of AlphaFold’s original training, which, while broad-ranging, lacked the granularity necessary for the high-precision demands of class I MHC-peptide interaction prediction. A comparative analysis was conducted against the homology-modeling-based method Pandora as well as the AlphaFold multimer model. Our results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model outperforms others in terms of root-mean-square deviation (median value for Cα atoms for peptides is 0.66 Å) and also provides enhanced predicted local distance difference test scores, offering a more reliable assessment of the predicted structures. These advances have substantial implications for computational immunology, potentially accelerating the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines by providing a more precise computational lens through which to view MHC-peptide interactions.",0
"Background:Routine vaccination coverage for adolescents living in the rural US is lower than adolescents living in urban areas. We sought to measure the effect of Boot Camp Translation (BCT), a community-based participatory intervention, on rural adolescent vaccination coverage.Methods:A cluster randomized controlled trial was performed September 2018-November 2021 involving 16 rural Colorado counties. Intervention county community members engaged in BCT to develop interventions to improve adolescent vaccination locally. Adolescent vaccination coverage was measured using the Colorado Immunization Information System.Results:For 11-12-year-olds, HPV initiation, HPV up-to-date, MenACWY, and Tdap vaccination coverage was lower post- versus pre-intervention in the control and intervention groups. For 11-12-year-olds in the intervention group, there was no significant difference post- versus pre-intervention in the odds of HPV vaccine initiation (adjusted ratio of odds ratios [aROR] = 0.93, 95 %: 0.85–1.02, p = 0.10) or up-to-date HPV vaccination (aROR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 0.98–1.23, p = 0.11) compared with the control group. Among 11-12-year-olds, the decrease in the proportion vaccinated with MenACWY and Tdap in the intervention group was significantly greater than the control group. Among 13-17-year-olds, there were significant increases in HPV initiation, HPV up-to-date, MenACWY, and Tdap vaccination coverage from pre- to post-intervention for both groups, with no significant differences between groups.Conclusion:11-12-year-old vaccination coverage decreased slightly from pre- to post-intervention while 13-17-year-old vaccination coverage increased. We saw no effect from the BCT intervention. Our findings about the effectiveness of BCT for improving vaccine uptake may not be generalizable because the study coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic.Clinical Trial Registry:This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03955757.","ABSTRACTGraves disease (GD) is the primary cause of hyperthyroidism in children. The standard management options—namely, antithyroid drugs (ATD), radioactive iodine, and surgery—have not changed for many years. Although ATD therapy is often the first-line treatment for pediatric patients, the low likelihood of spontaneous remission means that most children will require a more permanent solution. Recent clinical trials and systematic reviews have shed light on the long-term outcomes of ATD therapy, radioactive iodine, and surgical interventions in managing pediatric GD. Additionally, novel therapies aimed at B-cells or the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, both implicated in the pathogenesis of GD, are under investigation. However, their definitive role in treating childhood GD has yet to be established. This review will cover the latest developments in the treatment of childhood GD, including information on emerging targeted therapies.",1
"Background:Biologic agents are rapidly emerging as an effective therapy to treat autoimmune and other chronic diseases. The use of these agents is poorly characterized, resulting in a lack of guidance for dental practitioners. Case reports of oral adverse events have begun to emerge. However, their scope and frequency have not been summarized and analysed to date. The objective of this review was to characterize the literature on oral adverse effects associated with biological therapy when used for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.Methods:This review was developed in accordance with scoping review recommendations. Search strategies were developed and employed for six databases. Studies were selected using a systematic search process but with broad inclusion of study types given the paucity of information available. Reports of oral adverse events were analysed descriptively according to agent, mechanism of action, underlying disease, and oral adverse effect observed.Results:Our search returned 2080 articles and 51 met our inclusion criteria, of which most were case reports. The most frequent adverse effects included angioedema, oral lichenoid lesions, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and oral infections. There were also cases of oral malignancies associated with use of biologic agents. Less common effects such as pigmentation were also described.Conclusions:Oral adverse events have been reported in patients on biologic therapy, albeit in small numbers to date. This limits the generalizability of these results, which should not be used to generate a clinical guideline as they are based primarily on case reports. However, this study presents the first review characterizing the adverse effects observed. Large multi-center studies will be necessary to further define the oral and dental complications caused by biologic agents.","Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer (PC). Tryptophan oxidative catabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) cleaves the indole ring to kynurenine (Kyn), an endogenous ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which activates multiple tumorigenesis pathways. The IDO1-Kyn-AhR axis is aberrantly dysregulated in mCRPC. (−)-Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid. CBD showed antitumor activities against human malignancies, including PC. CBD showed potent in vitro dose-dependent reduction of viability and clonogenicity of diverse human PC cell lines. CBD reduced the expression of IDO1 and AhR in PC cells. A daily 15 mg/kg oral dose of CBD for 30 days effectively suppressed the progression of the mCRPC CWR-R1ca-Luc cells xenografted in male nude mice. Continued CBD oral dosing for an additional 45 days suppressed the CWR-R1ca-Luc tumor locoregional and distant recurrences after the primary tumors’ surgical excision. Collected CBD-treated tumors showed a reduced level of IDO1 expression. CBD-treated mice displayed a significant systemic reduction of Kyn.

"PurposeAs one of the most effective analgesics, opioids are essential for patients with cancer-related pain, even in the context of the opioid abuse crisis. The current meta-analysis aimed to identify whether concomitant exposure to opioids can affect the efficacy of ICIs and lead to a worse prognosis.MethodsPubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched based on the PRISMA checklist, through April 2022, for the following terms: (""opioids"" OR ""concomitant medication"") AND (""Neoplasm"" OR ""Carcinoma"" OR ""Cancer"" OR ""Tumor"") AND (""Immunotherapy"" OR ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor"" OR ""PD-L1 Inhibitor"" OR ""PD-1 Inhibitor"" OR ""CTLA-4 Inhibitor""). The outcomes considered were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) calculated using the random-effects or fixed-effects model.ResultsAfter screening 531 studies, a total of 7 articles involving 2690 patients were eligible for quantitative analysis. The use of opioids was negatively correlated with OS (HR 1.75, 95%CI 1.32–2.31, P < 0.001; I2 = 81%, P < 0.001) and significantly reduced the PFS (HR 1.61, 95%CI 1.41–1.83, P < 0.001; I2 = 0%, P = 0.63) of patients treated with ICIs. Similar results were obtained in each subgroup analysis. While NSAIDs could lead to poor OS (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03–1.51, P = 0.02; I2 = 0%, P = 0.60) but not PFS (HR 1.11, 95% CI = 0.89–1.39, P = 0.36) for ICIs patients. And sensitivity analyses confirmed the reliability of the results.ConclusionOpioids significantly reduced OS and PFS in patients receiving ICI therapy. Thus, the use of different types of opioids should be considered with caution, and it is necessary to actively develop alternative treatments.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04513-0.","AbstractThe management of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) has transformed over the past 2 decades. Advances in surgical techniques, systemic therapies, and local treatments have resulted in a paradigm shift. Disease that would once have been considered terminal is now frequently treated aggressively with both a disease-free and overall survival benefit. In line with the expanding range of treatment options, there has been an increase in the volume and complexity of imaging required in the management of these patients to ensure optimal patient selection and outcome. The radiologist plays a pivotal role in interpreting these studies, conveying the relevant information and informing the discussion at multidisciplinary team meetings. The purpose of this review is to provide an update for radiologists on the current surgical management of patients with CRLM highlighting specific imaging information that is required by the multidisciplinary team when assessing resectability and/or the need for additional liver-directed therapies.",0
"Currently, cancer immunotherapy efficacy is measured by endpoints, such as progression-free survival and overall survival, that are unable to reflect authentic responses to checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials. Second progression-free survival, however, could be an ideal surrogate endpoint due to its easy measurability, correlation with overall survival, and ability to evaluate the efficacy of sequential therapies. This commentary summarizes second progression-free survival data from clinical trials investigating first-line anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors. We speculate that first-line immunotherapies exert a positive influence on the efficacy of later therapies in patients with a few cancer types, though additional research is urgently warranted.","BackgroundDisulfidptosis, as a new mode of programmed cell death, is closely associated with tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, M2 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) plays an important role in tumor progression. Here, we propose to combine these two perspectives to detect novel disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related biomarkers in bladder cancer (BCa) to identify various tumor subtypes, construct prognostic features, reveal immune and somatic mutational landscapes, and screen for drugs in BCa.MethodsWe used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to mine M2 TAM-related genes. Consensus unsupervised clustering was performed to identify potential tumor subtypes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to build the risk model. We then explored the immune cell, immune function, immune checkpoint expression patterns and somatic mutational landscape in clusters and risk groups. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis for anti-cancer drugs.ResultsWe identified 3057 M2 TAM-related genes and intersected them with disulfidptosis-related genes to obtain 95 disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related genes (DMRGs). In terms of tumor subtypes, two molecular clusters were identified. Cluster 1 showed stronger immunogenicity and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). We also predicted 50 drugs with high sensitivity in cluster 1. On the basis of risk grouping, the high-risk group had poor overall survival in the training, test, and validation groups. Ten screened anti-cancer drugs were more sensitive in the high-risk group. A nomogram predicting survival of BCa patients was also established.ConclusionBy combining two hotspot perspectives, disulfidptosis and M2 TAM, we provide a valuable risk score signature for establishing individualized treatment regimens and drug choices. The risk score may serve as an independent risk factor for BCa patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05352-3.",1
"PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the effects of curcumin by co-administration of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment, using network pharmacology and experimental validation.MethodsUsing Pubchem database, Traditional Chinese Medicine Information Database (TCMID) database, and Swiss target prediction database to predict compound-related targets, AML-associated targets were determined using GeneCards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) databases. We identify overlapping common targets by comparing Compounds-related and AML-associated targets and using these targets to perform GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses. Subsequently, these targets were input into the STRING database, and we used Cytoscape to construct protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. Finally, we used KG1-a cells and the AML mouse model to measure the anti-leukemia effects of curcumin and As2O3 and their combination.ResultsCompounds and targets screening hinted that 85 intersection targets were predicted in the curcumin treatment of AML, 75 targets in the As2O3 treatment of AML, and 48 targets in the curcumin combined with the As2O3 treatment of AML. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the top 10 enriched biological processes and top 20 pathways implicated in the therapeutic effects of curcumin and As2O3 on AML, respectively. In addition, network pharmacology screening revealed STAT3, TP53, EP300, MAPK1, and PIK3CA as the top five genes in PPI network of curcumin treatment of AML and TP53, MAPK3, MAPK1, STAT3, and SRC as the top five genes in PPI network of As2O3 treatment of AML. Moreover, the in vitro experiment demonstrated that curcumin combined with As2O3 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in KG1-a cells, and this effect is more substantial than curcumin or As2O3 alone. Mechanistically, the curcumin combined with As2O3 significantly down-regulated the protein expression of JAK2, STAT3, and Bcl-2, and up-regulated the levels of P53, P27, and Bax. In the mouse model, the survival time of mice in each administration group was drawn out to varying degrees, with the most significant prolongation in the curcumin combined with the As2O3 group.ConclusionOur results suggested that curcumin and As2O3 combination therapy exerts more significant anti-leukemia effects in the treatment of AML than curcumin or As2O3 monotherapy by up-regulating p53 pathway and down-regulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04463-7.","IntroductionImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and has generated remarkable clinical results against multiple malignancies. Exploration of new technical approaches to further boost the therapeutic efficacy of ICB is of potential medical importance. In this study, we designed a novel nanotherapeutics for ICB immunotherapy.MethodsCTLA-4 aptamers were conjugated to the surface of albumin nanoparticle to construct an aptamer-modified nanostructure (Apt-NP). To improve ICB efficacy, fexofenadine (FEXO), an antihistamine, was encapsulated into Apt-NP to make a drug-loaded nanoparticle (Apt-NP-FEXO). The antitumor efficacies of Apt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsApt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO had average diameters of 149 nm and 159 nm, respectively. Similar to free CTLA-4 aptamers, Apt-modified NPs could selectively bind with CTLA-4 positive cells and improve lymphocyte-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity in vitro. In animal studies, compared with free CTLA-4 aptamer, Apt-NP significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Moreover, Apt-NP-FEXO further improved antitumor efficacy vs. Apt-NP in vivo.ConclusionThe results suggest that Apt-NP-FEXO represents a novel strategy to improve ICB outcome and may have application potential in cancer immunotherapy.",0
"Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a debilitating inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination, is significantly influenced by polygenic variations. Although the precise cause of MS remains unclear, it is believed to arise from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Recent investigations have focused on the polygenic nature of genetic alterations linked to MS risk. This review highlights the critical role of these genetic variants in shaping disease susceptibility and progression. Specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB50*101, HLA-DR2+, HLA-DQ6, DQA 0102, and DQB1 0602, are implicated in immune modulation, significantly increasing the risk of developing MS. Additionally, Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified non-HLA genetic variants that contribute to MS susceptibility, including IL-2RA (rs2104286), IL-7R (rs6897932), CD40 (rs1883832 T), CD58 (rs2300747), and others, each playing a role in immune regulation and disease progression. Dysfunctions in genes regulating myelin integrity, such as MOG (Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein), MAG (Myelin-associated Glycoprotein), and PLP1 (Proteolipid Protein 1), further drive MS pathogenesis. Moreover, viral infections, notably Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and measles virus, may exacerbate the development of MS by triggering immune responses. Understanding the contribution of these genetic and viral factors may shed light on the complex etiology of MS. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) provide a valuable tool for estimating MS susceptibility based on the cumulative effect of genetic variants. However, translating these genetic insights into clinical practice requires further validation, including environmental considerations. Investigating MS polygenicity could lead to personalized therapies, enhancing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, ultimately improving outcomes for MS patients.","AbstractBackgroundGuidelines for the management of patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP), who have metastatic disease without an identified primary tumor site, have evolved. We sought to describe the diagnostic work-up and outcomes of patients with CUP in Canada over the last decade. We also sought to identify factors associated with improved prognosis in CUP, including primary tumor site identification, identification of “favorable subtypes,” and concordance with published guidelines.MethodsWith ethics board approval, patients with histologically confirmed CUP between 2012 and 2021 in 3 Canadian cancer centers were reviewed and clinicopathological variables retrospectively collected. The primary endpoint was to describe significant trends in CUP diagnosis and management over the decade using linear regression models. Univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) logistic regression analyses identified variables correlated with primary site identification and overall survival (OS). Kaplan–Meier curves with the log-rank test were used to compare OS outcomes.ResultsIn total, 907 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 5.1 months. There was an increase in both 5-year survival and identification of primary tumors over the decade. Diagnostic tests including next-generation sequencing were independently associated with primary site identification on UVA. However, primary site identification was not found to be predictive of survival; instead, patients with “favorable subtypes” of CUP had significantly longer OS.ConclusionsSurvival in patients with CUP in Canada has been increasing over the last decade. Identifying the primary site does not influence survival, and efforts should be focused on discovering novel “favorable subtypes” which have superior outcomes.",1
"ABSTRACTPterostilbene (PT) is a naturally occurring small molecule stilbenoid that has garnered significant attention due to its potential therapeutic effects in tumor diseases. In this review, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the antitumor effects of PT and its derivatives on various cancer types, including colon, breast, liver, lung, and pancreatic cancers in recent 20 years. We have succinctly summarized the PT derivatives that exhibit superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to PT. Additionally, we reviewed the potential structure-activity relationship (SAR) rules and clinical application methods to establish a foundation for chemical modification and clinical utilization of stilbene compounds.","AbstractBackgroundAlterations in forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), a pioneer transcription factor, are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and prostate cancer. We characterized FOXA1 genomic alterations and their clinical impacts in a large pan-cancer cohort from the American Association for Cancer Research Genomics, Evidence, Neoplasia, Information, Exchange database.Methods FOXA1 alterations were characterized across more than 87 000 samples from more than 30 cancer types for primary and metastatic tumors alongside patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. FOXA1 alterations were queried in the Memorial Sloan Kettering - Metastatic Events and Tropisms (MSK-MET) cohort (a GENIE subset), allowing definition of hazard ratios (HRs) and survival estimates based on Cox proportional hazard models.Results FOXA1 was altered in 1869 (2.1%) samples, with distinct patterns across different cancers: prostate cancer enriched with indel-inframe alterations, breast cancer with missense mutations, and lung cancers with copy number amplifications. Of 74 715 samples with FOXA1 copy number profiles, amplification was detected in 834 (1.1%). Amplification was most common in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 3% in primary; 6% in metastatic) and small cell lung cancer (4.1% primary; 3.5% metastatic), followed by breast cancer (2% primary; 1.6% metastatic) and prostate cancer (2.2% primary; 1.6% metastatic). Copy number amplifications were associated with decreased overall survival in NSCLC (HR = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 1.99; P = .02), breast cancer (HR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.89 to 4.89; P = 4e−6), and prostate cancer (HR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.03 to 3.68; P = .04). Amplifications were associated with widespread metastases in NSCLC, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.Conclusions FOXA1 demonstrates distinct alteration profiles across cancer sites. Our findings suggest an association between FOXA1 amplification and enhanced metastatic potential and decreased survival, highlighting prognostic and therapeutic potential in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and NSCLC.",0
"IntroductionThe urinary microbiome (UMB) includes living bacteria, their genomes, and their products from interactions with the host environment. A “core” UMB could potentially exist, with variations between age and sex groups. Changes in UMB composition have been associated with benign urological disorders, but also with urologic cancers. Mechanisms through which UMB can trigger and maintain cancer can be local inflammation and interaction with immune system.Aim of the studyTo describe the association between UMB and development of urologic cancers.MethodsA non-systematic literature review identified recently published studies (last 5 years), involving human patients, dealing with UMB. The database used for this review was PubMed, and the identified studies served as the base for a narrative analysis of the literature that explored the potential associations between UMB and urological cancers.ResultsIn bladder cancer (BC), UMB may play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (and thus to progression to metastasis), as well as in effectiveness of BCG response rate. BC is also associated with changes in UMB, with bacterial richness indices increased in cancer groups compared to non-neoplastic groups and being different between NMIBC vs MIBC patients. In prostate cancer (PCa), there is an abundance in proinflammatory bacteria and uropathogens. In regard to renal cell carcinoma (RCC), penile cancer and testicular cancer there are still too few studies to draw significant conclusions about its relationship with the UMB.ConclusionsGaining a deeper understanding of UMB role in urologic tumors could aid in the development of new therapies and improve classification of patients’ risk.","Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent tumor, requiring the urgent development of novel therapies, especially for locally advanced and metastatic disease. Nintedanib is a potent anti-fibrotic angio-kinase inhibitor, which has shown clinical efficacy in combination with chemotherapy in locally advanced muscle invasive BC patients. Nintedanib inhibits Fibroblast Growth Factor receptors (FGFRs), validated targets in patients with BC harboring FGFR3/2 genetic alterations. Here, we aimed at studying its mechanisms of action to understand therapy resistance, identify markers predictive of response, and improve the design of future clinical trials. We have used a panel of genetically well-characterized human BC cells in order to identify the molecular and transcriptomic changes induced upon treatment with Nintedanib, in vitro and in vivo, at the tumor and stroma cell levels. We showed that BC cells display an intrinsic resistance to Nintedanib treatment in vitro, independently of their FGFR3 status. However, Nintedanib has higher antitumor activity on mouse xenografts. We have identified PI3K activation as a resistance mechanism against Nintedanib in BC and evidenced that the combination of Nintedanib with the PI3K inhibitor Alpelisib has synergistic antitumor activity. Treatment with this combination is associated with cell cycle inhibition at the tumoral and stromal levels and potent non-tumor cell autonomous effects on α-smooth muscle (SMA)-positive tumor infiltrating cells and tumor vasculature. The combination of Nintedanib with PI3K inhibitors not only reversed BC resistance to Nintedanib but also enhanced its anti-angiogenic effects.",1
"AbstractCancer immunotherapy is used to treat tumors by modulating the immune system. Although the anticancer efficacy of cancer immunotherapy has been evaluated prior to clinical trials, conventional in vivo animal and endpoint models inadequately replicate the intricate process of tumor elimination and reflect human‐specific immune systems. Therefore, more sophisticated models that mimic the complex tumor‐immune microenvironment must be employed to assess the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Additionally, using real‐time imaging technology, a step‐by‐step evaluation can be applied, allowing for a more precise assessment of treatment efficacy. Here, an overview of the various imaging‐based evaluation platforms recently developed for cancer immunotherapeutic applications is presented. Specifically, a fundamental technique is discussed for stably observing immune cell‐based tumor cell killing using direct imaging, a microwell that reproduces a confined space for spatial observation, a droplet assay that facilitates cell–cell interactions, and a 3D microphysiological system that reconstructs the vascular environment. Furthermore, it is suggested that future evaluation platforms pursue more human‐like immune systems.","PurposeProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) are considered predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in cervical cancer. However, their expression in primary tumors and metastases does not always match affecting the course of treatment. We investigated the consistency of their expression in primary and matched recurrent/metastatic lesions from patients with cervical cancer.MethodsPrimary and matched recurrent/metastatic specimens from patients with recurrent cervical cancer (n = 194) were stained for PD-L1 and MMR (MLHI, MSH6, MSH2, and PMS2) using immunohistochemistry. The degree of consistency of PD-L1 and MMR expression in these lesions was analyzed.ResultsThe inconsistency rate of PD-L1 expression in primary and recurrent/metastatic lesions was 33.0%, and it varied between the recurrence sites. Positive PD-L1 rate in primary lesions was lower (15.4%) than that in recurrent/metastatic lesions (30.4%). The discordance rate of MMR expression between primary and recurrent/metastatic lesions was 4.1%.ConclusionWe conclude that to use PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy, analysis of both metastatic and primary lesions may be required. High consistency rate of MMR expression between primary and metastatic lesions suggests that testing primary lesions alone can be sufficient for guiding the course of therapy, thereby solving the difficulty of obtaining recurrent/metastatic specimens in clinic.",0
"Senescent cells can either to promote immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment or facilitate immune surveillance. Despite the revolutionary impact of cancer immunotherapy, durable responses in solid tumors, particularly in advanced stages, remain limited. Recent studies have shed light on the influence of senescent status within the tumor microenvironment (TME) on therapy resistance and major efforts are needed to overcome these challenges. This review summarizes recent advancements in targeting cellular senescence, with a particular focus on immunomodulatory approaches on the hallmarks of cellular senescence.","Regulatory T cells (Tregs) establish dominant immune tolerance but obstruct tumor immune surveillance, warranting context-specific mechanistic insights into the functions of tumor-infiltrating Tregs (TIL-Tregs). We show that enhanced posttranslational O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) of cellular factors is a molecular feature that promotes a tumor-specific gene expression signature and distinguishes TIL-Tregs from their systemic counterparts. We found that altered glucose utilization through the glucose transporter Glut3 is a major facilitator of this process. Treg-specific deletion of Glut3 abrogates tumor immune tolerance, while steady-state immune homeostasis remains largely unaffected in mice. Furthermore, by employing mouse tumor models and human clinical data, we identified the NF-κB subunit c-Rel as one such factor that, through Glut3-dependent O-GlcNAcylation, functionally orchestrates gene expression in Tregs at tumor sites. Together, these results not only identify immunometabolic alterations and molecular events contributing to fundamental aspects of Treg biology, specifically at tumor sites but also reveal tumor-specific cellular properties that can aid in the development of Treg-targeted cancer immunotherapies.",1
"BACKGROUND & AIMS:In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a history of cancer, retrospective studies have suggested that exposure to immunosuppressive agents does not increase the risk of incident (recurrent or new) cancer compared with unexposed patients. Safety of Immunosuppression in a Prospective Cohort of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients and a HIstoRy of CancEr (SAPPHIRE) is a prospective registry aimed at addressing this issue.METHODS:Since 2016, patients with IBD and confirmed index cancer before enrollment were followed up annually. Patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation at enrollment, or recurrent cancer within 5 years, were excluded. The primary outcome was development of incident cancer related to exposure to immunosuppressive medications.RESULTS:Among 305 patients (47% male, 88% white), the median age at IBD diagnosis and cancer were 32 and 52 years, respectively. Index cancers were solid organ (46%), dermatologic (32%), gastrointestinal (13%), and hematologic (9%). During a median follow-up period of 4.8 years, 210 patients (69%) were exposed to immunosuppressive therapy and 46 patients (15%) developed incident cancers (25 new, 21 recurrent). In unadjusted analysis, the crude rate of incident cancer in unexposed patients was 2.58 per 100 person-years vs 4.78 per 100 person-years (relative risk, 1.85; 95% CI, 0.92–3.73) for immunosuppression-exposed patients. In a time-varying proportional hazards model adjusting for sex, smoking history, age and stage at index malignancy, and nonmelanoma skin cancer, no significant association was found between receipt of immunosuppression and incident cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.69–2.90), or with any major drug class.CONCLUSIONS:In this interim analysis of patients with IBD and a history of cancer, despite numerically increased adjusted hazard ratios, we did not find a statistically significant association between subsequent exposure to immunosuppressive therapies and development of incident cancers.","AbstractBackgroundPatients with brain tumors and their families often inquire about driving safety. Currently, there is no consensus regarding fitness-to-drive (FTD) for patients with central nervous system tumors. Our paper aims to provide a multi-disciplinary perspective to address this issue.MethodsWe performed a literature review for brain tumors and driving. Additionally, we solicited input from experts in tumor-related epilepsy, ophthalmology, neuropsychology, occupational therapy, and driving simulators.ResultsWe qualitatively analyzed 14 published articles. FTD determination varies internationally and regionally in most developed nations. Significant motor weakness and major cognitive impairment clearly prevent patients from driving. There are specialized tests for motor, vision, and cognitive correlates important to driving, but driving simulators and on-the-road tests provide the most comprehensive assessments. FTD for patients with seizures is dependent on region-specific laws that take into account the duration of seizure-free intervals and history of motor vehicular crashes.ConclusionsWe recommend a symptom-based approach that highlights the importance of interdisciplinary assessment to ensure that brain tumor patients have the minimum operational skills required to drive. It is crucial to document seizure control, visual acuity impairment, and visual field deficits because these factors usually become the default basis in practice to determine if driving privileges can be maintained. Appropriately, timed assessment of cognitive function may provide pertinent information to determine FTD. Formalized testing with practical driving evaluation may eventually be necessary in patients who have hemiparesis, hemiplegia, hemineglect, homonymous visual field loss, or any form of cognitive dysfunction to determine FTD.",0

However, the etiology and mechanism behind this degradation are still ambiguous. The aim of the study was to explore the etiopathogenetic mechanism behind CC, along with its association with degree of differentiation, angiogenic, phagocytic and antiapoptotic activity in OSCC.DesignSeventy-three tissue sections of various histological grades of OSCC were retrieved from departmental archives and scanned for cannibalistic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using CD31, CD68, and BCL2 was performed. The data obtained were analyzed using Chi-square, Spearman’s correlation test and multiple regression analysis (p < 0.05).ResultsCCs were present significantly in various grades of OSCC (p < 0.00). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant difference in CD68, BCL2 (p < 0.05 in both), and CD31 (p < 0.001) expression with CC. The internalized cells showed positivity for CD68 and negativity for BCL2. Regression analysis revealed that tumor grade, CD31 and BCL2 immunoreactivity were significant predictors of frequency of CC.ConclusionThe association of CC with degree of differentiation, CD31, CD68, and BCL2 expression could predict the biological behavior of OSCC and might serve as a promising histopathological parameter in future.",1
"Liver cancer is one of the most common malignancies. T-cell exhaustion is associated with immunosuppression of tumor and chronic infection. Although immunotherapies that enhance the immune response by targeting programmed cell death-1(PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been applied to malignancies, these treatments have shown limited response rates. This suggested that additional inhibitory receptors (IRs) also contributed to T-cell exhaustion and tumor prognosis. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) are usually in a dysfunctional state of exhaustion, such as impaired activity and proliferative ability, increased apoptosis rate, and reduced production of effector cytokines. Tex cells participate in the negative regulation of tumor immunity mainly through IRs on the cell surface, changes in cytokines and immunomodulatory cell types, causing tumor immune escape. However, T-cell exhaustion is not irreversible and targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can effectively reverse the exhaustion of T-cells and restore the anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, the research on the mechanism of T-cell exhaustion in liver cancer, aimed at maintaining or restoring the effector function of Tex cells, might provide a new method for the treatment of liver cancer. In this review, we summarized the basic characteristics of Tex cells (such as IRs and cytokines), discussed the mechanisms associated with T-cell exhaustion, and specifically discussed how these exhaustion characteristics were acquired and shaped by key factors within TME. Then new insights into the molecular mechanism of T-cell exhaustion suggested a potential way to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, namely to restore the effector function of Tex cells. In addition, we also reviewed the research progress of T-cell exhaustion in recent years and provided suggestions for further research.","In response to prolonged stimulation by tumour antigens, T cells gradually become exhausted. There is growing evidence that exhausted T cells not only lose their potent effector functions but also express multiple inhibitory receptors. Checkpoint blockade (CPB) therapy can improve cancer by reactivating exhausted effector cell function, leading to durable clinical responses, but further improvements are needed given the limited number of patients who benefit from treatment, even with autoimmune complications. Here, we suggest, based on recent advances that tumour antigens are the primary culprits of exhaustion, followed by some immune cells and cytokines that also play an accomplice role in the exhaustion process, and we also propose that chronic stress-induced hypoxia and hormones also play an important role in promoting T-cell exhaustion. Understanding the classification of exhausted CD8+ T-cell subpopulations and their functions is important for the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapies. We mapped the differentiation of T-cell exhausted subpopulations by changes in transcription factors, indicating that T-cell exhaustion is a dynamic developmental process. Finally, we summarized the novel immune checkpoints associated with depletion in recent years and combined them with bioinformatics to construct a web of exhaustion-related immune checkpoints with the aim of finding novel therapeutic targets associated with T-cell exhaustion in malignant tumours, aiming to revive the killing ability of exhausted T cells and restore anti-tumour immunity through combined targeted immunotherapy.",1
"PurposeFluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel (FLOT) regimen has shown strong efficacy as perioperative therapy for patients with locally advanced gastric (GC) and gastroesophageal (AEG) carcinoma. In the palliative situation, FLOT is recommended only for young fit patients. Data of efficacy and tolerability of FLOT in elderly patients are scarce and controversial. Thus, this study aimed to provide real-life experience of elderly patients with GC and AEG treated with FLOT as first-line palliative chemotherapy.MethodsPatients with advanced or metastatic GC or AEG and treated with FLOT as first-line palliative therapy between 2010 and 2021 were analyzed. Patients were grouped into < 65 years old (n = 35) and ≥ 65 years old (n = 22) groups. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), feasibility and toxicity were analyzed.ResultsThe median OS was 10.4 months with no significant difference between both groups (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.48, 1.57; p = 0.632). The ECOG performance status showed powerful influence on OS in the subgroup analysis with median OS of 12.3 months for ECOG = 0 compared to 5.0 months for ECOG ≥ 1 (p = 0.015) as well as in multivariate analysis (HR 2.62; 95% CI 1.36, 5.04; p = 0.004).ConclusionIn the present study the ECOG performance status showed a stronger prognostic value than patient age in FLOT as first- line therapy in a real-life cohort with advanced and metastatic GC and AEG. The performance status should therefore be considered in the therapeutic decision making of elderly patients with GC and AEG.","BackgroundThe survival trends and prognostic factors of patients with extraosseous plasmacytoma (EOP) or extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) have not been reported in recent years. The objective of this study was to develop a novel nomogram and risk stratification system for predicting the overall survival (OS) of elderly patients with EOP based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.MethodsThe demographic characteristics of 900 patients aged 60 years and above, diagnosed with EOP between 2000 and 2019, were extracted from the SEER database. The patient population was randomly divided into a training cohort and an internal validation cohort in a ratio of 7:3. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of prognosis in elderly EOP patients, followed by developing a nomogram for prognostic assessment. The performance of the model was evaluated through receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, C-index, calibration curves for calibration accuracy assessment, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess its clinical utility. All elderly EOP patients were stratified into three risk subgroups by cutoff value utilizing X-tile software based on their total OS scores for comparative analysis purposes. Kaplan–Meier (K–M) survival curve analysis was employed to validate any observed differences in OS among these three risk groups.ResultsSix factors including age, year of diagnosis, marital status, primary site, surgery, and prior tumor history were identified to be independently predictive of the OS of elderly patients with EOP, and these predictors were included in the construction of the nomogram. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year area under the curves (AUCs) for OS were 0.717, 0.754, and 0.734 in the training cohort and 0.740, 0.730, and 0.765 in the validation cohort, respectively. The C-index values in the two cohorts were 0.695 and 0.690. The calibration curves and DCA exhibit commendable consistency and validity, respectively, thereby demonstrating their robust performance. The training set was stratified into low-, medium-, and high-risk subgroups based on the optimal cutoff points (167.8 and 264.8) identified. The K–M curve and cumulative risk curve exhibited statistically significant disparities in survival rates among the groups.ConclusionsWe developed a nomogram and risk classification system, which can serve as an intuitive and effective tool for clinicians to enhance the prediction of OS in elderly EOP patients, thereby facilitating the formulation of more rational and personalized treatment strategies.",1
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have markedly transformed cancer treatment paradigms but are frequently associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) affecting multiple organ systems. Among the rare and severe complications is the “triple M syndrome”, encompassing myositis, myocarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.We present the case of an 83-year-old male with stage IIc melanoma who received pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy following surgical excision of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes, with no evidence of neoplastic invasion. Approximately one month post-infusion, the patient experienced episodes of syncope, leading to the diagnosis of a second-degree atrioventricular block. Despite normal findings on echocardiography, the patient subsequently developed profound proximal muscle weakness, dysphonia, and dysphagia. Pembrolizumab was promptly discontinued, and the patient was initiated on high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone; however, his clinical course rapidly deteriorated, culminating in the necessity for palliative care due to progressive respiratory failure.This case underscores the potential for severe, life-threatening irAEs associated with pembrolizumab therapy, particularly in the form of triple M syndrome. Notably, the manifestations of myocarditis and myasthenia gravis (MG) within this context may occur in the absence of typical autoantibody markers, thereby complicating the diagnostic process and contributing to poor prognostic outcomes. This case highlights the imperative for heightened clinical vigilance and a proactive approach to monitoring for irAEs in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Early recognition, coupled with the prompt initiation of therapeutic interventions, is paramount in mitigating morbidity and improving clinical outcomes in these critical scenarios.","Background and Clinical Significance: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but may underlie diverse and potentially life-threatening immune-related adverse events (irAEs). They may cause various conditions leading to respiratory failure, including myasthenic syndromes and myositis. However, diaphragmatic paralysis (DP) has rarely been reported. To describe patients with diaphragmatic paralysis in a pharmacovigilance registry, we searched the prospective REISAMIC registry at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Center (Villejuif, France) for cases of diaphragmatic palsy (DP) occurring from September 2014 to December 2021. Case Presentation: We identified three patients, in whom DP was confirmed by diaphragmatic ultrasonography, pulmonary function tests, and/or diaphragmatic electroneuromyogram. Diaphragmatic palsy was life-threatening in all patients, as it caused respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In all cases, a pre-existing subclinical paraneoplastic syndrome was detected. Onconeural antibodies (anti-titin and anti-VGCC) were detected in these patients before and after the initiation of ICI therapy, suggesting a mixed paraneoplastic syndrome with features overlapping those of myasthenic syndrome (myasthenia gravis in one patient and Lambert–Eaton syndrome in another) and myositis. Conclusions: Diaphragmatic palsy is a severe irAE potentially resulting from different mechanisms, including myositis and neuromuscular junction involvement (myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton). Antineuronal antibodies associated with such conditions were already present in our patients prior to immunotherapy initiation, suggesting ICIs could trigger flare-ups of pre-existing silent paraneoplastic autoimmune conditions.",1
"ObjectiveCellular cannibalism (CC) is a prime metabolic event to determine the aggressive potential of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the etiology and mechanism behind this degradation are still ambiguous. The aim of the study was to explore the etiopathogenetic mechanism behind CC, along with its association with degree of differentiation, angiogenic, phagocytic and antiapoptotic activity in OSCC.DesignSeventy-three tissue sections of various histological grades of OSCC were retrieved from departmental archives and scanned for cannibalistic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using CD31, CD68, and BCL2 was performed. The data obtained were analyzed using Chi-square, Spearman’s correlation test and multiple regression analysis (p < 0.05).ResultsCCs were present significantly in various grades of OSCC (p < 0.00). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant difference in CD68, BCL2 (p < 0.05 in both), and CD31 (p < 0.001) expression with CC. The internalized cells showed positivity for CD68 and negativity for BCL2. Regression analysis revealed that tumor grade, CD31 and BCL2 immunoreactivity were significant predictors of frequency of CC.ConclusionThe association of CC with degree of differentiation, CD31, CD68, and BCL2 expression could predict the biological behavior of OSCC and might serve as a promising histopathological parameter in future.","Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant disease in the world which has a profound effect on human health and life quality. According to tumor stage and pathological diagnosis, OSCC is mainly treated by combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, traditional treatment methods suffer from some limitations, such as systemic toxicity, limited therapeutic effect and drug resistance. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, nanodrug delivery systems (DDSs) and intelligent DDSs have been widely used in targeted therapy for OSCC. Meanwhile, the newly developed therapeutic techniques such as immunotherapy, gene therapy and bionic technology provide the possibility to realize the active targeted therapy. Here, the latest advances of target therapy for OSCC are reviewed, and their therapeutic remarks, current limits and future prospects are also systematically interpreted. It is believed that active and passive targeted therapies have great potentials for clinical transformation and application of OSCC, which will greatly improve human quality of life.",1
"Gene dysregulations are associated with many human diseases, such as cancers and hereditary diseases. Artificial transcription factors (ATFs) are synthetic molecular tools to regulate the expression of disease-associated genes, which is of great significance in basic biological research and biomedical applications. Recent advances in the engineering of ATFs for regulating endogenous gene expression provide an expanded set of tools for understanding and treating diseases. However, the potential immunogenicity, large size, inefficient delivery, and off-target effects persist as obstacles for ATFs to be developed into therapeutics. Moreover, the activation of an endogenous gene following ATF activity lacks durability. In this review, we first describe the functional components of ATFs, including DNA-binding domains, transcriptional effector domains, and control switches. We then highlight examples of applications of ATFs, including cell reprogramming and differentiation, pathogenic gene screening, and disease treatment. Finally, we analyze and summarize major challenges for the clinical translation of ATFs and propose potential strategies to improve these useful molecular tools.","BackgroundNeoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) using the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) protocol has improved esophageal cancer outcomes. This study reports the real-world experience of the CROSS regimen for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) regarding its feasibility, safety, and predictors of treatment completion from an Indian tertiary center.MethodologyA retrospective review was conducted for patients with ESCC receiving CROSS (radiation dose: 41.4 Gy) or a modified CROSS (mCROSS; radiation dose: 45 Gy) protocol NACRT between 2015 and 2022. We studied the treatment tolerability, factors predicting NACRT completion, and the effect of completion of its chemotherapy component on the pathological outcomes.Results Of the109 patients (68.8% males; mean age, 56 ± 9 years; Charlson's comorbidity index [CCI] >2, 19.3%; stage III–IVA, 58%; mean tumor length, 5.5 ± 2.1cm; CROSS, 70.6%; mCROSS, 29.4%), all except 4 completed radiotherapy but only 58 (53.2%) patients completed ≥4 cycles of chemotherapy. Forty-nine patients belonged to the “extended” CROSS trial inclusion criteria. Among the 60 patients who fulfilled the CROSS inclusion criteria, only 51.7% were able to complete ≥4 chemotherapy cycles. The commonest reason for noncompletion of chemotherapy was the occurrence of neutropenia (60.8%). Pretreatment hemoglobin (≥12 vs. <12 g%; odds ratio [OR]: 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–6.96; p = 0.031), a low CCI (≤2 vs. >2; OR: 2.98; 95% CI: 1.02–8.73; p = 0.047), and radiation therapy techniques (conformal vs. conventional; OR: 3.29; 95% CI: 1.14–9.50; p = 0.028) were associated with completion of chemotherapy (≥4 cycles). Although there was a trend toward improved R0 resection (95.7 vs. 91.4%), reduced node positivity (17.0 vs. 31.4%), and a high pCR (57.4 vs. 48.6%) in patients completing chemotherapy (≥4 cycles) compared with those not completing chemotherapy (<4 cycles), these differences were statistically nonsignificant. ConclusionIn this study, ESCC patients receiving the CROSS protocol NACRT could complete their radiotherapy component, but a significant proportion exhibited poor chemotherapy tolerance. Neutropenia was a major factor limiting chemotherapy delivery, but anemia, high CCI, and conventional radiation techniques were also associated with noncompletion of chemotherapy. The omission of a few chemotherapy cycles had no significant effect on the pathological response; however, its impact on cancer survival requires further evaluation.",0
"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for adrenal gland metastasis, with a focus on the assessment of the irradiated subjects’ endocrinological function.Materials and methodsA total of 36 patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2020 in this prospective phase II trial. Patients were treated with Linac-based SBRT, with a dose of 45 Gy in 3 consecutive fractions. Primary end-point was local control (LC) of the treated lesions and secondary end-points included evaluation of acute and late toxicity, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and the impact on the hormonal production of adrenal glands.ResultsWith a median follow-up of 9.5 months, LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 94.7% and 88.4%, respectively. Rates of PFS at 1 and 2 years were 50.5% and 29.8%, with a median PFS of 14.7 months. Rates of OS at 1 and 2 years were 62.9% and 44.1%. At univariate analysis, oligorecurrence was associated with better OS compared to oligoprogressive or synchronous metastatic disease. No grade 3 or greater toxicities were registered and only a minority of patients (22.2%) reported mild treatment-related side effects. Hormonal and electrolytes production was assessed before and after treatment, showing only a slight and transient variation within the reference ranges.ConclusionSBRT on adrenal metastases has been confirmed to be a feasible and effective treatment. With an excellent disease control and the preservation of the endocrine function, SBRT with ablative dose can be considered a viable alternative to more invasive approaches.","BackgroundDelivering stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with multiple oligometastases represents a challenge for clinical and technical reasons. We aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with SABR and the impact of tumor volume on survival.Materials and methodsWe included all the patients treated with single course SABR for 3 to 5 extracranial oligometastases. All patients were treated with the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique with ablative intent. End-points of the analysis were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), local control (LC) and toxicity.Results136 patients were treated from 2012 to 2020 on 451 oligometastases. Most common primary tumor was colorectal cancer (44.1%) followed by lung cancer (11.8%). A total of 3, 4 and 5 lesions were simultaneously treated in 102 (75.0%), 26 (19.1%), and 8 (5.9%) patients, respectively. Median total tumor volume (TTV) was 19.1 cc (range 0.6–245.1). With a median follow-up of 25.0 months, OS at 1 and 3 years was 88.4% and 50.2%, respectively. Increasing TTV was independent predictive factor of worse OS (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.18–4.78, p = 0.014) and PFS (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.05–2.54; p = 0.028). Median OS was 80.6 months if tumor volume was ≤ 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 93.6% and 77.5%, respectively), and 31.1 months if TTV was higher than 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 86.7% and 42.3%, respectively). Rates of LC at 1 and 3 years were 89.3% and 76.5%. In terms of toxicity, no grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported both in the acute and late settings.ConclusionWe demonstrated the impact of tumor volume on survival and disease control of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with single course SABR.",1
"AbstractWith substantial effects on human health, air pollution has become a major global concern. Air pollution has been linked to numerous gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases with increasing mortalities. The gut and respiratory dysbiosis brought about by air pollution has recently received much attention. This review attempts to provide an overview of the types of air pollutants, their sources, their impact on the respiratory and gut dysbiotic patterns and their correlation with five major diseases including pneumonia, asthma, COPD, lung cancer and irritable bowel syndrome. Deeper insights into the links between pollutants, dysbiosis and disease may pave the way for novel diagnostic biomarkers for prognosis and early detection of these diseases, as well as ways to ease the disease burden.","Antibodies targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD1) and its ligand (PDL1) have transformed current cancer therapy while little is known about the expression of anti-PD1/PDL1 autoantibodies between lung cancer (LC) patients and normal controls (NC). The expression level of anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG and IgM was detected in plasma of 325 LC and 324 NC by indirect enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) were used to verify the ELISA results. The association analysis was used to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) of LC. The expression of anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG in LC samples was significantly higher than NC (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). The positive rate of anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG in LC was significantly higher than NC and significant difference was also shown in LC samples of different clinical characteristics, such as clinical stage, nodules diameter, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Moreover, PD1/PDL1 expression in tissues showed no significant relation with that in plasma (P > 0.05). Anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG were the risk factors related to LC (OR (95% CI): 22.433 (5.426–92.745) and 5.051 (1.316–19.386)), while anti-PD1/PDL1 IgM were the risk factors for LC with ≤ 60 years (OR (95% CI): 6.122 (1.365–27.455) and 7.664 (1.715–34.251)) and anti-PD1 IgM was also the risk factor for male LC cases(OR (95% CI): 6.948 (1.076–44.868)). Plasma anti-PD1/PDL1 IgG and IgM might serve as potential biomarkers and risk predictors for LC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04360-z.",0
"ABSTRACTAimsThis study aimed to develop novel molecular hybrid conjugates integrating isatin, rhodanine, and phthalimide pharmacophores to create effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents with improved safety profiles over existing treatments.Materials & MethodsA series of hybrid conjugates (4a – l) were synthesized and evaluated through in vitro and in vivo biological assays. The most promising compound, 4c, underwent extensive pharmacological and toxicological evaluations. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and 2D-QSAR studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism of action and validate the experimental findings.ResultsCompound 4c exhibited potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, effectively inhibiting COX-2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). Its superior selectivity index (SI) was 1.11 compared to 0.67 for indomethacin. It demonstrated an ulcer index of 2.9 versus 10.23 for indomethacin, indicating reduced gastrointestinal toxicity. Molecular docking simulations revealed a strong binding affinity with COX-2 (−9.832 kcal/mol), and molecular dynamics confirmed the stability of the COX-2 complex.ConclusionsCompound 4c emerged as a promising lead candidate for developing safer and more effective anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Its robust efficacy, safety profile, and computational validation highlight its potential for further optimization in therapeutic applications.","There is a critical unmet need for safe and efficacious neoadjuvant treatment for cisplatin-ineligible patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Here we launched a phase 1b study using the combination of intravesical cretostimogene grenadenorepvec (oncolytic serotype 5 adenovirus encoding granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor) with systemic nivolumab in cisplatin-ineligible patients with cT2–4aN0–1M0 muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The primary objective was to measure safety, and the secondary objective was to assess the anti-tumor efficacy as measured by pathologic complete response along with 1-year recurrence-free survival. No dose-limiting toxicity was encountered in 21 patients enrolled and treated. Combination treatment achieved a pathologic complete response rate of 42.1% and a 1-year recurrence-free survival rate of 70.4%. Pathologic response was associated with baseline free E2F activity and tumor mutational burden but not PD-L1 status. Although T cell infiltration was broadly induced after intravesical oncolytic immunotherapy, the formation, enlargement and maturation of tertiary lymphoid structures was specifically associated with complete response, supporting the importance of coordinated humoral and cellular immune responses. Together, these results highlight the potential of this combination regimen to enhance therapeutic efficacy in cisplatin-ineligible patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, warranting additional study as a neoadjuvant therapeutic option.

"Systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) for tissue-specific targeting using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) holds great therapeutic potential. Nevertheless, how the structural characteristics of ionizable lipids (lipidoids) impact their capability to target cells and organs remains unclear. Here we engineered a class of siloxane-based ionizable lipids with varying structures and formulated siloxane-incorporated LNPs (SiLNPs) to control in vivo mRNA delivery to the liver, lung and spleen in mice. The siloxane moieties enhance cellular internalization of mRNA-LNPs and improve their endosomal escape capacity, augmenting their mRNA delivery efficacy. Using organ-specific SiLNPs to deliver gene editing machinery, we achieve robust gene knockout in the liver of wild-type mice and in the lungs of both transgenic GFP and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumour-bearing mice. Moreover, we showed effective recovery from viral infection-induced lung damage by delivering angiogenic factors with lung-targeted Si5-N14 LNPs. We envision that our SiLNPs will aid in the clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics for next-generation tissue-specific protein replacement therapies, regenerative medicine and gene editing.","BackgroundMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin with high mortality. However, its clinical characteristics in Asian patients remain uncertain owing to its low incidence.ObjectiveTo analyze the clinicopathological features of MCC and identify factors associated with its prognosis.MethodsThe medical records of 62 patients with MCC were retrospectively reviewed. Data on clinical features, survival outcomes, prognostic factors, histopathology and immunohistochemical profile of the patients were collected and analyzed. Merkel cell polyomavirus status was evaluated using immunohistochemistry.ResultsThe incidence of MCC significantly increased over time. The mean duration of follow-up was 51.2 months, with an overall 5-year survival of 80.6%. More female patients with MCC were identified than male patients (1.3:1). Approximately half of the patients had stage I disease at the time of initial presentation. The primary tumor was frequently located in the lower extremities (40.3%), followed by the head and neck (32.3%), upper extremities (22.6%), and the trunk (4.8%). Male sex was associated with poorer overall survival (p = 0.003). Post-resection adjuvant radiotherapy significantly improved the overall survival (p = 0.023). Sentinel lymph node biopsy during surgery ameliorated the progression-free survival (p = 0.036) in patients with stage I or II cancer. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion were associated with a poor prognosis. Old age, immunohistochemical profiles, and Merkel cell polyomavirus-positivity were not associated with prognosis.ConclusionPost-surgical adjuvant radiotherapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy significantly improve the course of MCC.",0
"AbstractThe advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented potential for the targeted manipulation of DNA sequences. Advances in the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas9 system allowed potential applicability for the treatment of genetic diseases. CRISPR-Cas9’s mechanism of action involves the use of an RNA guide molecule to target-specific DNA sequences and the Cas9 enzyme to induce precise DNA cleavage. In the context of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, this review covers nonviral delivery methods for gene editing based on peptide internalization. Here, we describe critical areas of discussion such as immunogenicity, emphasizing the importance of safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, particularly in the context of treating single-mutation genetic diseases using advanced editing techniques genetics as prime editor and base editor. The text discusses the versatility of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) in forming complexes for delivering biomolecules, particularly ribonucleoprotein for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells. In addition, it emphasizes the promise of combining CPPs with DNA base editing and prime editing systems. These systems, known for their simplicity and precision, hold great potential for correcting point mutations in human genetic diseases. In summary, the text provides a clear overview of the advantages of using CPPs for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9, particularly in conjunction with advanced editing systems, highlighting their potential impact on clinical applications in the treatment of single-mutation genetic diseases.","Key Points•IL-18-secreting CAR T cells promote clearance of antigen-low myeloma with reprogramming of cells in the myeloma microenvironment.•Multiantigen targeting enhances T-cell-target avidity, increasing engineered IL-18 output and potentiating antimyeloma activity.",0
"Purpose of ReviewAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal blood neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Despite the introduction of many novel targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the standard of care for AML. Differences in mitochondrial metabolism between normal and leukemic cells can be targeted by novel AML therapies, but these agents require a comprehensive efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluation.Recent FindingsMetabolic alterations in AML blasts increase their sensitivity to therapies targeting mitochondrial metabolism. Targeting altered mitochondrial metabolism, that is crucial for leukemia cell growth and survival, could be a breakthrough in AML treatment. Therefore, BH3 family proteins, mitochondrial complexes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism are common treatment targets in AML. Although many drugs targeting these vulnerabilities showed acceptable safety profiles and promising efficacy in preclinical studies, clinical trials often do not confirm these results limited by narrow therapeutic window. The most effective regimens are based on drug combinations with synergistic or additive activity.SummaryIn this review, we present an overview of the most recent studies targeting mitochondrial metabolism in AML. We highlight that targeting of the specific energy metabolism dependencies of AML blasts provides an opportunity to achieve long-term responses with a reasonable safety profile. We emphasize that currently used drugs and their combinations display dose-limiting toxicities or are not efficient enough to completely eradicate leukemic stem cells. Thus, further studies of complex metabolic rewiring of leukemia cells before and after combinatorial therapies are warranted.","Senescent cells can either to promote immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment or facilitate immune surveillance. Despite the revolutionary impact of cancer immunotherapy, durable responses in solid tumors, particularly in advanced stages, remain limited.

This review summarizes recent advancements in targeting cellular senescence, with a particular focus on immunomodulatory approaches on the hallmarks of cellular senescence.",0
"AbstractBackground and AimsOver the last decade, treatment options for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) have expanded. However, comparative studies between these agents are limited, especially among biologic-naive patients. We aimed to compare the persistence, effectiveness, and safety of tofacitinib and vedolizumab as the first advanced treatment for patients with UC.MethodsPatients who received either tofacitinib or vedolizumab as their first advanced therapy for UC in NHS Lothian were included. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting. The probability of treatment assignment was calculated via logistic regression using age, sex, UC duration, Montreal extent, C-reactive protein, concomitant corticosteroids, and partial Mayo score at drug commencement.ResultsWe included n = 158 patients, of whom n = 81 (51.3%) received vedolizumab and n = 77 (48.7%) tofacitinib. Median follow-up for vedolizumab patients was 3.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.6-4.8) and for tofacitinib patients 1.5 years (IQR 0.3-2.3). The cohort was 59.5% male with a median age of 41.1 years (IQR 31.5-51.8). At 2 years, vedolizumab persistence was superior to tofacitinib (p = 0.005). At Weeks 12 and 52, clinical, biochemical, and fecal biomarker steroid-free remission were comparable between groups. Primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response were 9.9% and 17.3% for vedolizumab and 23.4% and 13% for tofacitinib, respectively. The frequency of adverse events was comparable (11 [13.6%] vedolizumab vs 19 [24.7%] tofacitinib, p = 0.629).ConclusionsWe found that the persistence and tolerability of vedolizumab were superior to tofacitinib in bio-naive UC, although the rates of clinical and biomarker remission were comparable. These data may help inform the positioning of advanced therapy.","AbstractIntroductionImmunotherapy is the first-line treatment for intermediate-advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although its outcomes vary. This study aimed to identify imaging biomarkers of immunotherapy susceptibility linked to gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) and immune phenotypes, particularly immune-excluded phenotypes, with a tumor immune barrier.MethodsWe performed immunohistochemical staining with a CD8+ antibody, and samples were classified into immune-inflamed, -intermediate, -excluded, and -ignored phenotypes. We assessed EOB-MRI findings obtained from 104 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC and evaluated the relationship between MRI findings and immune phenotype. Spatial transcriptome analysis of tumor tissues in each immune phenotype was performed to characterize the MRI findings. For validation, we analyzed the treatment effect on 60 nodules in another cohort of 27 patients who received combined immunotherapy using anti-programmed death-ligand 1 and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies.ResultsHCCs with rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) (odds ratio [OR] 17.3, p = 0.009), peritumoral enhancement in the arterial phase (OR: 8.6, p < 0.004), and intermediate intensity on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) measured with a visual 3-point scale (OR: 28.2, p = 0.002) were associated with immune-excluded phenotype, where tumors tended to be larger and of the single nodular type with extranodular growth and confluent multinodular rather than the simple nodular type. Spatial transcriptome analysis revealed a spatial relationship among cytotoxic T lymphocytes, VEGF signals, and cancer-associated fibroblasts at the tumor-invasive margins in this phenotype. From the validation study, nodules with any one of these three imaging findings had a significantly prolonged time to-nodular progression (p = 0.007, median not reached vs. 226 days).ConclusionHCCs with rim APHE, peritumoral enhancement in arterial phase, and intermediate intensity on HBP with visual 3-point scale could be non-invasive biomarkers to predict the immune-excluded phenotype with the tumor immune barrier. These HCCs were most likely to respond to combined immunotherapy.",0
"Conventional blood-based biomarkers and radiographic imaging are excellent for use in monitoring different aspects of malignant disease, but given their specific shortcomings, their integration with other, complementary markers such as plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be beneficial toward a precision medicine–driven future. Plasma ctDNA analysis utilizes the measurement of cancer-specific molecular alterations in a variety of bodily fluids released by dying tumor cells to monitor and profile response to therapy, and is being employed in several clinical scenarios. Plasma concentrations of ctDNA have been reported to correlate with tumor burden. However, the strength of this association is generally poor and highly variable, confounding the interpretation of longitudinal plasma ctDNA measurements in conjunction with routine radiographic assessments. Herein is discussed what is currently understood with respect to the fundamental characteristics of tumor growth that dictate plasma ctDNA concentrations, with a perspective on its interpretation in conjunction with radiographically determined tumor burden assessments.","PurposeThe aim of this study was to analyse the correlation of extracranial metastasis sites (ECMs) to the incidence risk of brain metastasis (BMs) in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods18349 newly diagnosed patients were retrospectively analysed, and 4919 pairs of cases were matched by propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio. Alternative factors were analysed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. And the interaction analysis and subgroup analysis were carried out. ResultsThe incidences of Brain, Lung, Liver, Bone, Multiple and Other metastasis were 26.9%, 20.2%, 4.6%, 19.9%, 16.9% and 38.3%, respectively. Results suggested that Age, Race, Histological type, Grade, T stage, N stage and Organ metastasis site were risk factors (p < 0.05). The interaction analysis suggested interaction effects between the Primary site, T stage, N stage and Organ metastasis site. The subgroup analysis showed that the Organ metastasis site and the risk of BMs were statistically significant except that the Overlapping subgroup (p = 0.267) of the Primary site. And the incidence risk of BMs in Lung metastasis, Liver metastasis and Bone metastasis groups was lower than that in other metastasis group (OR 1, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the Multiple metastasis group and the other metastasis group (OR 1.091, p = 0.169).ConclusionAdvanced age, non-Asian/Pacific Islander, non-squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated grade, and higher T/N stage were risk factors for increased BMs in stage IV NSCLC, and the ECMs were associated with the risk of BMs.",0
"Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies are emerging in the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as the dominant ablative approach as an alternative to surgery for primary breast cancer in patients who do not wish to have surgery or are poor surgical candidates. Cryoablation is well tolerated and provides excellent local control and cosmesis. Thermal ablation may also be used in the treatment of oligometastatic breast cancer, allowing patients to achieve long disease-free intervals. Transarterial therapies have been studied in the treatment of oligoprogressive hepatic metastasis, though further supportive data would be helpful to demonstrate its efficacy.","AbstractBreast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. The difficulties with anticancer medications, such as ineffective targeting, larger doses, toxicity to healthy cells and side effects, have prompted attention to alternate approaches to address these difficulties. RNA interference by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is one such tactic. When compared with chemotherapy, siRNA has several advantages, including the ability to quickly modify and suppress the expression of the target gene and display superior efficacy and safety. However, there are known challenges and hurdles that limits their clinical translation. Decomposition by endonucleases, renal clearance, hydrophilicity, negative surface charge, short half-life and off-target effects of naked siRNA are obstacles that hinder the desired biological activity of naked siRNA. Nanoparticulate systems such as polymeric, lipid, lipid-polymeric, metallic, mesoporous silica nanoparticles and several other nanocarriers were used for effective delivery of siRNA and to knock down genes involved in breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. The focus of this review is to provide a comprehensive picture of various strategies utilized for delivering siRNA, such as combinatorial delivery, development of modified nanoparticles, smart nanocarriers and nanocarriers that target angiogenesis, cancer stem cells and metastasis of breast cancer.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown significant efficacy in hematological diseases. However, CAR T therapy has demonstrated limited efficacy in solid tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). One of the most important reasons is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor growth and suppresses immune cells used to eliminate tumor cells. The human transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) plays a crucial role in forming the suppressive GBM TME and driving the suppression of the anti-GBM response. To mitigate TGF-β-mediated suppressive activity, we combined a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor II (dnTGFβRII) with our previous bicistronic CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 construct, currently being evaluated in a clinical trial, to generate CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII, a tri-modular construct we are developing for clinical application. We hypothesized that this approach would more effectively subvert resistance mechanisms observed with GBM. Our data suggest that CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2-dnTGFβRII significantly augments T cell proliferation, enhances functional responses, and improves the fitness of bystander cells, particularly by decreasing the TGF-β concentration in a TGF-β-rich TME. In addition, in vivo studies validate the safety and efficacy of the dnTGFβRII cooperating with CARs in targeting and eradicating GBM in an NSG mouse model.","PurposeImmunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors against anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), has not been successful in treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), dendritic cells (DCs), and the TGF-β cytokine are critical in anti-cancer immunity. We hypothesized that TGF-β enhances the immunosuppressive effects of TAM, MDSC, and DC presence in tumors.MethodsUsing a murine PDAC cell line derived from a genetically engineered mouse model, we orthotopically implanted treated cells plus drug embedded in Matrigel into immunocompetent mice. Treatments included saline control, TGF-β1, or a TGF-β receptor 1 small molecule inhibitor, galunisertib. We investigated TAM, MDSC, DC, and TAM PD-L1 expression with flow cytometry in tumors. Separately, we used the TIMER2.0 database to analyze TAM and PD-L1 gene expression in human PDAC tumors in TCGA database.ResultsTGF-β did not alter MDSC or DC frequencies in the primary tumors. However, in PDAC metastases to the liver, TGF-β decreased the proportion of MDSCs (P=0.022) and DCs (P=0.005). TGF-β significantly increased the percent of high PD-L1 expressing TAMs (32 ± 6 % vs. 12 ± 5%, P=0.013) but not the proportion of TAMs in primary and metastatic tumors. TAM PD-L1 gene expression in TCGA PDAC database was significantly correlated with tgb1 and tgfbr1 gene expression (P<0.01).ConclusionsTGF-β is important in PDAC anti-tumor immunity, demonstrating context-dependent impact on immune cells. TGF-β has an overall immunosuppressive effect mediated by TAM PD-L1 expression and decreased presence of DCs. Future investigations will focus on enhancing anti-cancer immune effects of TGF-β receptor inhibition.",1
"ABSTRACTBackgroundRecently, we developed AT101, an IgM-class mouse monoclonal antibody directed against glypican-1 (GPC1), a proteoglycan that can be considered as useful target for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment being specifically and highly expressed on GBM cell surface. Here, we proposed the use of AT101 as targeting agent in a drug delivery nanoplatfom to effectively deliver chitosan nanobubbles (NBs) for GBM treatment.MethodsChitosan NBs were prepared and conjugated with AT101 or left unconjugated as control.ResultsThe ability of AT101 to bind the GPC1 protein was demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis in the “GBM-like” GPC1-expressing cell lines U-87 MG and T98G. AT101 was shown to bind GPC1-expressing GBM tumor samples by immunofluorescence. In-vivo experiments in the U-87 MG xenograft model showed that AT101 was able to bind GPC1 on cell surface and accumulate in U-87 MG tumor masses (p = 0.0002 respect to control). Moreover, in-vivo experiments showed that AT101 is able to target GPC1 when conjugated to chitosan NBs, thus increasing their specific deliver to GPC1-expressing cells of U-87 MG tumor, as compared to chitosan NBs not conjugated to AT101 (p = 0.02).ConclusionsAT101 is an useful targeting agent for the development of drug delivery nanoplatforms for GBM treatment.","AbstractBackgroundGlutamine is an important nutrient for cancer cell growth that provides biological sources for nucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis, but the role of glutaminolysis in signal transduction and glioblastoma (GBM) progression remains little known.MethodsKnockdown and overexpression cells were obtained to explore the functional roles of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) in cell proliferation, tumor formation, and aerobic glycolysis. RNA-seq, Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase assay, and western blot were performed to verify the regulation of the EGFR-AKT pathway by the GDH1 (also known as GLUD1) and KDM6A. Metabolite-level measurements and Seahorse Assay were performed to assess the functional role of GHD1 in reprogramming glycolysis.ResultsHere, we report that GDH1 catalytic glutaminolysis is essential for GBM cell line proliferation and brain tumorigenesis even in high-glucose conditions. Glutamine is metabolized through glutaminolysis to produce α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). We demonstrate that glutamine in combination with leucine activates mammalian TORC1 by enhancing glutaminolysis and α-KG production. α-KG increases the transcription of PDPK1 by reducing the suppressive histone modification H3K27me3 and then promotes the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This transcriptional activation induced by α-KG requires histone demethylase KDM6A, which is a 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase that plays an important role in converting α-KG to succinate. Furthermore, we show that GDH1-catalytic glutaminolysis also increases the expression of HK2 and promotes glycolysis in high-glucose conditions dependent on KDM6A-mediated demethylation of H3K27.ConclusionsThese findings suggest a novel function of glutaminolysis in the regulation of signal transduction and metabolism reprogramming and provide further evidence for the unique role of glutaminolysis in GBM progression.",1
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have brought new hope for the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) over the past decades. However, the overall response rate is limited, and is lower than that in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This is in part because of the lack of pre-existing tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TITLs), especially cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), in the SCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in insufficient anti-tumor immune response. To unleash the full potential of ICIs, the trafficking and infiltration of TITLs to the tumor is necessary and tightly regulated, the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment blunts the infiltration and function of TITLs that reach the tumor in SCLC. Here, we review the characteristics of TITLs, the effects of various factors on T cell infiltration, and possible strategies to restore or promote T cell infiltration in the TME of SCLC.","Antibody therapy for HIV-1 infection exerts two broad effects: a drug-like, antiviral effect, which rapidly lowers the viral load, and a vaccinal effect, which may control the viral load long-term by improving the immune response. Here, we elucidate a trade-off between these two effects as they pertain to the humoral response, which may compromise antibody therapy aimed at eliciting long-term HIV-1 remission. We developed a multi-scale computational model that combined within-host viral dynamics and stochastic simulations of the germinal centre (GC) reaction, enabling simultaneous quantification of the antiviral and vaccinal effects of antibody therapy. The model predicted that increasing antibody dosage or antibody–antigen affinity increased immune complex formation and enhanced GC output. Beyond a point, however, a strong antiviral effect reduced antigen levels substantially, extinguishing GCs and limiting the humoral response. We found signatures of this trade-off in clinical studies. Accounting for the trade-off could be important in optimizing antibody therapy for HIV-1 remission.",0
"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the role of LINC00513 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression.Materials & methods: Cell proliferation was evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell migration was detected with transwell assay. RNA pull-down was applied for verifying the interactions between LINC00513, IGF2BP1 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF).Results: LINC00513, IGF2BP1 and CTGF levels were upregulated in CRC. Knockdown of LINC00513 significantly inhibited the malignant behavior of CRC cells. LINC00513 increased CTGF mRNA stability by binding with IGF2BP1. Furthermore, overexpression of IGF2BP1 or CTGF reversed the inhibitory effect of LINC00513 shRNA on CRC progression.Conclusion: LINC00513 promoted CRC cell malignant behaviors through IGF2BP1/CTGF.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and highly recurrent malignancies worldwide and currently ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The high degree of morbidity and mortality associated with CRC is primarily attributed to the limited effectiveness of current therapeutic approaches and the emergence of chemoresistance to standard treatment modalities. Recent research indicates that several natural products, including Aronia berry extracts (ABE) and oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs), might offer a safe, cost-effective, and multi-targeted adjunctive role to cancer treatment. Herein, we hypothesized a combined treatment with ABE and OPCs could synergistically modulate multiple oncogenic pathways in CRC, thereby enhancing their anticancer activity. We initially conducted a series of in vitro experiments to assess the synergistic anticancer effects of ABE and OPCs on CRC cell lines. We demonstrate that these two compounds exhibited a superior synergistic anti-cancer potential vs. individual treatments in enhancing the ability to inhibit cell viability, suppress colony formation, and induce apoptosis (p < 0.05). Consistent with our in vitro findings, we validated this combinatorial anti-cancer effect in tumor-derived 3D organoids (PDOs; p < 0.01). Using genome-wide transcriptomic profiling, we identified that a specific gene, LMNB1, associated with the cell apoptosis pathway, was found to play a crucial role in exhibiting anti-cancer effects with these two products. Furthermore, the combined treatment of ABE and OPCs significantly impacted the expression of key proteins involved in apoptosis, including suppressed expression levels of LMNB1 in CRC cell lines (p < 0.05), which resulted in inhibiting downstream AKT phosphorylation. In conclusion, our study provides novel evidence of the synergistic anticancer effects of ABE and OPCs in CRC cells, partially mediated through the regulation of apoptosis and the oncogene LMNB1 within the AKT signaling pathway. These findings have the potential to better appreciate the anticancer potential of natural products in CRC and help improve treatment outcomes in this malignancy.",1
"BackgroundTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that exhibits elevated glycolytic capacity. Lactate, as a byproduct of glycolysis, is considered a major oncometabolite that plays an important role in oncogenesis and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. However, the potential roles of lactate in TNBC are not yet fully understood. In this study, our goal was to identify prognosis-related lactate genes (PLGs) and construct a lactate-related prognostic model (LRPM) for TNBC.MethodsFirst, we applied lactate-related genes to classify TNBC samples using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Then, we performed the log-rank analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis to screen PLGs and construct the LRPM. The biological functions of the identified PLGs in TNBC were investigated using CCK8 assay and clone formation assay. Finally, we constructed a nomogram based on the lactate-risk score and tumor clinical stage. We used the operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis to evaluate the predictive capability of the nomogram.ResultsOur results showed that the TNBC samples could be classified into two subgroups with different survival probabilities. Three genes (NDUFAF3, CARS2 and FH), which can suppress TNBC cell proliferation, were identified as PLGs. Moreover, the LRPM and nomogram exhibited excellent predictive performance for TNBC patient prognosis.ConclusionWe have developed a novel LRPM that enables risk stratification and identification of poor molecular subtypes in TNBC patients, showing great potential in clinical practice.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05171-6.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that is capturing popular imagination and can revolutionize biomedicine. AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to break through existing barriers in oncology research and practice such as automating workflow processes, personalizing care, and reducing healthcare disparities. Emerging applications of AI/ML in the literature include screening and early detection of cancer, disease diagnosis, response prediction, prognosis, and accelerated drug discovery. Despite this excitement, only few AI/ML models have been properly validated and fewer have become regulated products for routine clinical use. In this review, we highlight the main challenges impeding AI/ML clinical translation. We present different clinical use cases from the domains of radiology, radiation oncology, immunotherapy, and drug discovery in oncology. We dissect the unique challenges and opportunities associated with each of these cases. Finally, we summarize the general requirements for successful AI/ML implementation in the clinic, highlighting specific examples and points of emphasis including the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration of stakeholders, role of domain experts in AI augmentation, transparency of AI/ML models, and the establishment of a comprehensive quality assurance program to mitigate risks of training bias and data drifts, all culminating toward safer and more beneficial AI/ML applications in oncology labs and clinics.",0
"BackgroundVasculogenic mimicry (VM), an alternative microvascular circulation independent of angiogenesis, is formed by aggressive cancer cells. Tumor-expressed B7-H3 has been reported to promote VM formation in hepatocellular carcinoma and modulate angiogenesis in breast cancer and colorectal cancer. However, its effects on VM generation and angiogenesis in non-small cell Lung cancer (NSCLC) remained to be elucidated.MethodsCRISPR/Cas9-mediated B7-H3 knockout (KO) was conducted in NSCLC A549 and H3255 cells. The expression of VM-related proteins, including vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), and the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured by western blotting and chemiluminescence assay in both B7-H3 KO and mock-edited A549 and H3255 cells. To examine VM formation, a three-dimensional (3D) culture model was used for B7-H3 KO and mock A549 and H3255 cells. For in vivo analysis, xenograft mice models were established using B7-H3 KO and mock-edited A549 cells, and immunohistochemical (CD31) and histochemical (periodic acid-Schiff, PAS) double staining were performed to identify VM and endothelial vessels in tumor tissues. Finally, specific signaling inhibitors were used to analyze B7-H3-induced signaling pathway responsible for VE-cadherin and MMP14 expression and VM generation.ResultsHigher expression of B7-H3 was associated with a worse prognosis and more advanced T-category in NSCLC. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated B7-H3 KO in A549 and H3255 cells led to decreased expression of VE-cadherin and MMP14; however, the secretion of VEGF by the two cell lines remained unchanged. In the 3D cell culture model, both B7-H3 KO A549 and H3255 cells showed a significant reduction in the formation of capillary-like tubular structures compared to mock-edited cells. In the in vivo xenograft model, mock-edited A549 cells formed excessive PAS+ CD31− VM channels, while B7-H3 KO restrained VM formation in the xenograft tumors. However, no significant differences were found in CD31+ endothelial vessels between xenografts formed by B7-H3 KO and mock-edited A549 cells. Finally, we analyzed the signaling pathway responsible for B7-H3-induced VM formation and found that selective inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) hyperactivation by LY294002 was associated with decreased expression of MMP14 and VE-cadherin, and in vitro VM formation by both A549 and H3255 cells.ConclusionsTumor-expressed B7-H3 acts via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote VM formation by NSCLC cells while bears no effects on angiogenesis in NSCLC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04790-3.","We propose a new graph neural network (GNN) module, based on relaxations of recently proposed geometric scattering transforms, which consist of a cascade of graph wavelet filters. Our learnable geometric scattering (LEGS) module enables adaptive tuning of the wavelets to encourage band-pass features to emerge in learned representations. The incorporation of our LEGS-module in GNNs enables the learning of longer-range graph relations compared to many popular GNNs, which often rely on encoding graph structure via smoothness or similarity between neighbors. Further, its wavelet priors result in simplified architectures with significantly fewer learned parameters compared to competing GNNs. We demonstrate the predictive performance of LEGS-based networks on graph classification benchmarks, as well as the descriptive quality of their learned features in biochemical graph data exploration tasks. Our results show that LEGS-based networks match or outperforms popular GNNs, as well as the original geometric scattering construction, on many datasets, in particular in biochemical domains, while retaining certain mathematical properties of handcrafted (non-learned) geometric scattering.",0
"The P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated ion channel which belongs to the P2X receptor family, plays critical roles in recognizing extracellular adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) and is widely expressed in most tumor cells as well as inflammatory cells. Previously, the P2X7 receptor has been demonstrated to modulate the progression of various malignancies, including glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. However, the biological function and prognostic values of P2X7 receptor in hepatocellular carcinoma remain to be determined. Here, we investigated the expression level of P2X7 receptor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Then MTS and EdU assays were carried out to study the role of P2X7 receptor blockade in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, the underlying mechanism was further elucidated by bulk RNAseq. Compared to the control group, the P2X7 receptor was significantly up-regulated in the hepatocellular carcinoma group. Interestingly, A740003 and A438079, two selective antagonists at P2X7 receptor, significantly blocked Ca2+ influx and decreased the proliferative rate of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the expression level of chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CHSY1), an enzyme that mediates the polymerization step of chondroitin sulfate, was reduced by both A740003 and A438079. In conclusion, inhibition of the P2X7 receptor attenuated the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and this process was largely modulated by CHSY1. Thus, our findings reveal a previously unknown role for P2X7 receptor in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and imply that the P2X7 receptor may represent a new target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11302-024-10064-5.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the sixth most common malignancy but the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. Significant breakthroughs have been made in systemic treatment for HCC over the past two decades, which have improved treatment outcomes. In addition to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (mTKIs), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic drugs are increasingly being applied. The combination of ICI and antiangiogenic or dual ICIs has become the new standard of care due to remarkable response rates. However, currently available systemic regimens are primarily reserved for certain patients in the intermediate and advanced stages who will not benefit from locoregional treatments. Evidence supporting the use of systemic treatment as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies in patients with early-stage HCC, especially the high risk of recurrence after curative treatments, remains limited. This review identified recent developments in systemic therapy, including mTKIs and ICIs, considering results on first- and second-line treatment, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and combination with loco-regional therapy. Various ongoing clinical trials regarding the role of systemic therapies and potential novel targets in patients with early-, intermediate-, and advanced-stage HCC were also summarized and revealed that systemic therapy is no longer limited to advanced-stage HCC. Moreover, the introduction of T-cell redirecting strategies, including bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, has revolutionized the treatment landscape for HCC. Future research should focus on an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms governing the establishment of tumor barriers.",1
"A significant clinical challenge in lung cancer treatment is management of the inevitable acquired resistance to third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs), such as osimertinib, which have shown remarkable success in the treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations, in order to achieve maximal response duration or treatment remission. Apoptosis is a major type of programmed cell death tightly associated with cancer development and treatment. Evasion of apoptosis is considered a key hallmark of cancer and acquisition of apoptosis resistance is accordingly a key mechanism of drug acquired resistance in cancer therapy. It has been clearly shown that effective induction of apoptosis is a key mechanism for third generation EGFR-TKIs, particularly osimertinib, to exert their therapeutic efficacies and the development of resistance to apoptosis is tightly associated with the emergence of acquired resistance. Hence, restoration of cell sensitivity to undergo apoptosis using various means promises an effective strategy for the management of acquired resistance to third generation EGFR-TKIs.","Aim: The present investigation aimed to develop niosomes containing gold nanoparticles (Nio-AuNPs) and to evaluate the combinational effect of Nio-AuNPs and x-ray radiation therapy (XRT) on growth inhibition potential and induction of apoptosis in the A549 cell line.Materials & methods: Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized, and niosomes were prepared using the thin-film hydration method. Various techniques were employed to determine their physiochemical characteristics. MTT assay, cell apoptosis analysis and combination index analysis were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic feasibility of Nio-AuNPs combined with XRT.Results: The combination of Nio-AuNPs and XRT resulted in greater cytotoxicity compared with XRT alone or with AuNPs.Conclusion: The AuNPs-loaded niosomal formulation enhances the efficacy of XRT on lung cancer cells in vitro, presenting a promising and effective therapeutic strategy.",1
"Background:More than 50% of patients with lung cancer are admitted to the hospital while receiving treatment, which is a burden to patients and the healthcare system. This study characterizes the risk factors and outcomes of patients with lung cancer who were admitted to the hospital.Methods:A multidisciplinary oncology care team conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients with lung cancer admitted in 2018. Demographics, disease and admission characteristics, and end-of-life care utilization were recorded. Following a multidisciplinary consensus review process, admissions were determined to be either “avoidable” or “unavoidable.” Generalized estimating equation logistic regression models assessed risks and outcomes associated with avoidable admissions.Results:In all, 319 admissions for 188 patients with a median age of 66 years (IQR, 59–74 years) were included. Cancer-related symptoms accounted for 65% of hospitalizations. Common causes of unavoidable hospitalizations were unexpected disease progression causing symptoms, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, and infection. Of the 47 hospitalizations identified as avoidable (15%), the median overall survival was 1.6 months compared with 9.7 months (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.34–3.19; P<.001) for unavoidable hospitalizations. Significant reasons for avoidable admissions included cancer-related pain (P = .02), hypervolemia (P = .03), patient desire to initiate hospice services (P = .01), and errors in medication reconciliation or distribution (P<.001). Errors in medication management caused 26% of the avoidable hospitalizations. Of admissions in patients receiving immunotherapy (n = 102) or targeted therapy (n = 44), 9% were due to adverse effects of treatment. Patients receiving immunotherapy and targeted therapy were at similar risk of avoidable hospitalizations compared with patients not receiving treatment (P = .3 and P = .1, respectively).Conclusions:We found that 15% of hospitalizations among patients with lung cancer were potentially avoidable. Uncontrolled symptoms, delayed implementation of end-of-life care, and errors in medication reconciliation were associated with avoidable inpatient admissions. Symptom management tools, palliative care integration, and medication reconciliations may mitigate hospitalization risk.",ABSTRACTLatest developments in the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine compiled from publicly available information and press releases from non-academic institutions in September 2024.,0
"Breast cancer has a high incidence and high heterogeneity among women worldwide, but its lack of highly consistent in vitro research models has limited the translation of experimental results into clinical applications. The emergence of tumor organoids in the new era has aroused great interest among scientists. Organoids possess multi-omics characteristics highly preserved from parental tumors and offer advantages such as long-term and stable passaging and visualization in vitro. Thus, they have overcome multiple defects of two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). However, the lack of inter-organoid homogeneity, vascular-like fluid system and complex microenvironment has affected their wider applications, making it urgent to introduce new approaches for developing a more comprehensive functionality of this model. In recent years, the combination of tumor organoids with other innovative technologies has provided some relevantly important solutions and made it an optimal high-throughput and high-fidelity in vitro model. Here, we provide an overview of the development and optimization of breast cancer organoids, discuss how they have been integrated with several emerging technologies, and further summarize their applications in functional precision oncology. We believe that the intersection of new technologies has great potential in breast cancer translational research, which may finally provide new insights into organoid-guided breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment.","Lung Cancer remains a significant health concern, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic avenues due to the limited efficacy and adverse effects of current treatments. In this study, we utilized a thorough in-silico and in-vitro methodology to develop prospective drugs for the treatment of lung cancer. The active components of Citrus latifolia were identified through the utilization of a variety of pharmacological instruments, such as Gene Ontology, GeneCards, DrugBank, the Chinese Traditional Drug Database, and GeneMANIA. Subsequent molecular docking studies using GOLD software revealed Hesperidin as the most promising candidate, exhibiting a remarkable binding affinity (GOLD score: 60.98 kcal/mol) towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a pivotal target in lung cancer therapy. Further validation through Schrodinger-Glide redocking reaffirmed the robust interaction between Hesperidin and EGFR. Pharmacokinetic profiling of top-scoring ligands indicated favorable drug-like properties, supporting their therapeutic potential. Molecular dynamics simulations employing Desmond software demonstrated the structural stability and persistence of the Hesperidin-EGFR complex over a 100-ns trajectory, corroborating its efficacy. Additionally, cytotoxicity analysis revealed a potent inhibitory effect of Hesperidin with an IC50 value of 34.25 µg/ml. Collectively, our findings underscore Hesperidin from Citrus latifolia as a promising candidate for lung cancer therapy, warranting further investigation through in-vivo studies for clinical translation.Graphical Abstract",0
"BackgroundSinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) comprises <1% of all head and neck cancers but has one of the highest 5-year mortalities.MethodsA systematic review and analysis using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses) guidelines was conducted on SNMM survival, recurrence, and prognostic factors.Results A total of 2,379 abstracts were reviewed resulting in 90 studies describing 3347 SNMM patients. Patients were 49.65% male and 66.5 years old. Surgery plus radiation therapy, followed by surgery only, then radiation only were the most common treatments. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy were used in 418 patients and 101 respectively. The 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals are 55.97, 40.09, and 30.35%, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival and disease-specific survival are 25.56 and 38.04%. The 5-year local, regional, and distant recurrence-free survivals are 42.35, 81.64, and 44.65%. Mean survival after diagnosis was 26.99 months. Local ( n = 650), regional ( n = 226), and distant ( n = 723) failure presented after 19.36, 6.35, and 12.42 months. Sites of metastasis were lung, liver, bone, brain, skin, kidney, and adrenal glands. Distant metastases, disease in the paranasal sinuses, and higher stage were noted to have worse survival outcomes. Positive margins did not significantly impact overall survival in 11/12 studies. ConclusionOverall survival over 20 years has remained poor with 70% of patients deceased in 5 years. About half of patients will develop distant failure and will thereafter rapidly decline. These data indicate need for advances in treatment of SNMM and new efforts with targeted immunotherapy offer a promising avenue toward improving survival outcomes.","Aim: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers. Research in various cancers suggests that investigating target biomarkers may provide directions to precision medicine. However, expression of biomarkers varies across different populations. The biomarker profile of Pakistani patients with PDAC remains unexplored.Materials & methods: We conducted a study on 109 patients to analyze a panel of four proteins (KRAS, p53, BRCA1 and APC) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples. After confirmation of diagnosis and appropriate tumor content, tissues were processed with antibody specific immunohistochemistry experiments. Subsequently, independent microscopic observation was conducted by two pathologists using scoring criteria specific for each antibody.Results: Statistical analysis showed that negative expression of p53 was significantly associated with positive expression of BRCA1 (p = 0.000) and APC (p = 0.007). The expression of BRCA1 was also found significantly associated with APC (p = 0.028). None of the protein showed association with overall survival or patient demographics. Moreover, KRAS expression was shown to be significantly associated with perineural invasion (p = 0.005).Conclusion: This is the first study that investigates protein biomarker expression in a large cohort of Pakistani PDAC patients. The findings from the study may provide directions about the population specific biomarkers and targeted therapies for these patients.",1
"PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) targeted therapies may be useful for several cancers. The use of non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic molecular imaging platforms could improve clinical assessment of PD-L1 tumor status during these therapies. Contrast enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging (CE-USMI) techniques may offer versatile and cost-effective ways to detect and quantify the expression levels of cellular targets in vivo. However, conventional use of microbubbles as a blood pool contrast agent for CE-USMI is limited to accessing intravascular biomarkers rather than reflecting the tumor molecular status. Using a microfluidic based reconstruction process we therefore developed ultra-stable nanobubbles (NBs) as a contrast agent for molecular imaging of vascular and extravascular cell surface markers. We then functionalized these NBs by covalently linking to nanobody (FN3hPD-L1) targeting human (h)PD-L1 to measure the expression of human PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo. We showed the specific binding of hPD-L1 targeted NBs in cell culture, and in xenografted mouse models of hPD-L1 expressing CT26 tumors. CE-USMI of hPD-L1 in the TME in vivo showed ~3-fold increase in contrast signal compared to non-targeted NBs. Overall, in vivo use of CE-USMI with hPD-L1 targeted NBs has the potential for clinical translation and imaging of human cancers during immunotherapy, and for prognostic evaluation of patient response to PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy.","BackgroundThe CD-TK double suicide gene has become an effective therapy for bladder cancer. A novel molecular-targeted ultrasound (US) method has been developed to precisely guide nanobubbles loaded with this gene to regions within bladder tumor cells and is widely used due to its efficiency in delivering drugs to the target tumor.MethodsUniform nanoscaled nanobubbles loaded with CD-TK double suicide gene were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods.ResultsIn the present study, we synthesized CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded cationic nanobubbles conjugated with anti-VEGFR2 that can bind with VEGFR2-positive cells. Fluorescence and flow cytometry evidence show that CD-TK double suicide gene-loaded nanobubbles were successfully developed. CD-TK-CNBs delivered via US-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) enhanced transfection efficiency, overexpression of CD-TK double suicide gene, and tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro.ConclusionsThese CD-TK-CNBs may become a novel treatment for bladder cancer.",1
"AbstractGlioblastoma (GBM) remains to be one of the deadliest cancers with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. While immunotherapies have revolutionized the field for other cancers, GBM remains resistant to these types of interventions partly due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by accumulation of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify molecular targets for improve anti-tumorigenic T cell response. Previous studies in our laboratory identified dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an exopeptidase and a membrane-bound signaling receptor, as a potential marker of immunosuppression in GBM. While DPP-4 is well-drugged due to its role in insulin metabolism, the function of DPP-4 in immune regulation and cancer remains poorly defined. I observed that DPP-4 is highly expressed by CD8+ T cells GBM patients and preclinical models. Furthermore, DPP-4 levels increased with the exhaustion or memory differentiation of effector T cell. Pharmaceutical inhibition of DPP-4 enriched expression of genes related to lymphocyte activation and mitochondrial metabolism. These transcriptional changes were accompanied by enhanced T cell proliferation, cytotoxic function, and effector mediator production under exhaustion conditions. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 promotes anti-tumorigenic function of CD8+ T-cell by preventing exhaustion and support future translational efforts to repurpose DPP-4 inhibitors as immunotherapy agents in GBM, given their favorable safety profiles.","IntroductionThe aim of this study was to investigate the role of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis and to develop a nomogram for predicting HCC prognosis.Method In this study, 1066 HCC patients were enrolled between August 2018 and April 2022. TK1 levels were measured within one week before enrollment, and the relationship with HCC prognosis was evaluated. Next, all patients were randomly assigned to the training set (70%, n = 746) and the validation set (30%, n = 320). We used multivariate Cox analysis to find independent prognostic factors in the training set to construct a nomogram. The predictive power of the nomogram was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The optimal critical value of TK1 was determined as 2.35 U/L using X-tile software.ResultBefore and after propensity score matching (PSM), the median overall survival (mOS) of the low-TK1 group (< 2.35 U/L) remained significantly longer than that of the high-TK1 group (≥ 2.35 U/L) (48.1 vs 16.5 months, p < 0.001; 75.7 vs 19.8 months, p = 0.001). Moreover, multivariate Cox analysis showed that the low TK1 level was an independent positive prognostic indicator. Additionally, the area under the ROC curve for predicting the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates was 0.770, 0.758, and 0.805, respectively.ConclusionsTK1 could serve as a prognostic marker for HCC. In addition, the nomogram showed good predictive capability for HCC prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05089-z.",0
"PurposeTumor growth relies on the sufficient blood supply and continuously requires new blood vessels to maintain, which lead to vascular abnormalities (Folkman, N Engl J Med 285:1182–1186, 1971). Antiangiogenic therapy has emerged with the goal of normalizing vasculature and tumor microenvironment (TME). Some antiangiogenic therapies combined with chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy have been approved for clinical application. In this review, we summarize the recent advances of antiangiogenic combination therapeutic strategies in advanced NSCLC.MethodsReferences of this review are searched through PubMed and EMBASE and the abstracts of cancer conferences. The ClinicalTrials.gov database was used for relative trials.ResultsBased on different mechanisms, antiangiogenic agents can be divided into monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which mainly include bevacizumab and ramucirumab, and multi-target antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which include sunitinib, sorafenib, nintedanib, apatinib, anlotinib, fruquintinib, etc. In recent years, a number of large clinical studies have shown that antiangiogenic agents have conferred a significant overall survival (OS) benefit to patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). More and more evidences confirm that the combination of antiangiogenic agents with chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy can improve the effect and prolong the survival of NSCLC patients. However, many problems about the application of antiangiogenic agents on advanced NSCLC patients still need to be explored. For example, the combination therapy of multi-target antiangiogenic agents is just beginning, and the biomarkers are not clear.ConclusionsAntiangiogenic agents can achieve therapeutic benefit in advanced NSCLC patients and the combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy can lead to synergistic effect. However, exploring the best combination therapy and efficacy-related biomarkers needs further study.","Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant disease in the world which has a profound effect on human health and life quality. According to tumor stage and pathological diagnosis, OSCC is mainly treated by combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, traditional treatment methods suffer from some limitations, such as systemic toxicity, limited therapeutic effect and drug resistance. With the rapid development of nanotechnology, nanodrug delivery systems (DDSs) and intelligent DDSs have been widely used in targeted therapy for OSCC. Meanwhile, the newly developed therapeutic techniques such as immunotherapy, gene therapy and bionic technology provide the possibility to realize the active targeted therapy. Here, the latest advances of target therapy for OSCC are reviewed, and their therapeutic remarks, current limits and future prospects are also systematically interpreted. It is believed that active and passive targeted therapies have great potentials for clinical transformation and application of OSCC, which will greatly improve human quality of life.",1
"IntroductionMetastasis remains the major cause of death in breast cancer (BrCa) and lacks specific treatment strategies. The kynurenine pathway (KP) has been suggested as a key mechanism facilitating progression of BrCa. While KP activity has been explored in primary BrCa, its role in metastasis remains unclear. To better understand this, we examined changes in the KP of BrCa with no metastasis compared to BCa that produced local or distant metastases. Given that the cancer cell secretome plays a role in metastasis, we also investigated the relationship between changes in KP activity and serum proteins of patients with local or distant metastases.MethodsTo investigate changes in the KP in BrCa, with and without metastasis, we quantified KP metabolites in blood sera collected from patients with stage 1 BrCa (n = 34), BrCa with local metastases (n = 46), BrCa with distant metastases (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 39). The serum protein profile of the BrCa patients with local or distant metastasis was determined before correlation analyses were carried out to examine the relationship between changes in the KP and cancer serum proteins using SPSS.ResultsWe found that the KP was elevated in BrCa patients with local and distant metastasis compared to healthy controls and stage 1 BrCa patients. The activity of kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) and kynureninase (KYNU) A was positively associated with disease stage and was higher compared to healthy controls. Proteome analysis in patients with local or distant metastasis revealed the dysregulation of 14 proteins, 9 of which were up-regulated and 5 down-regulated at the distant metastasis stage. Importantly, three of these proteins have not been previously linked to BrCa metastasis. In the correlation studies between the KP profile, cancer serum proteins and metastasis status, KYNU A had the greatest number of significant associations with cancer serum protein, followed by KMO.ConclusionOur findings reveal that the KP was regulated differently at various stages of BrCa and was more dysregulated in patients with local or distant metastasis. These KP activity changes showed a significant association with cancer serum proteins in BrCa patients with local or distant metastasis, highlighting the potential role of KP in BrCa metastasis.","Background and aimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The mechanisms driving the transition from hepatitis to cirrhosis, and eventually, to HCC are unclear. This study aimed to clarify the metabolic changes that underly the progression of HCC and identify potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers.MethodsThis prospective study collected serum samples from patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC, hospitalized at the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, from December 2022 to December 2023. The samples were analyzed using non-targeted, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis modeling and t-tests were used to identify key differentially expressed metabolites associated with the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the key metabolic pathways involved, while machine learning models were applied to identify the metabolite signatures.ResultsWe identified 153 differentially expressed metabolites in the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis to HCC, many of which were involved in ammonia cycling or the metabolism of methylhistidine, alanine, arginine, proline, or betaine. We also identified L-histidine and adenosine as the metabolites that demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing among the hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC stages.ConclusionsOur study comprehensively characterized the metabolic profiles of the different stages of the hepatitis-cirrhosis-HCC transition. We showed that serum metabolite detection is a viable diagnostic tool for identifying and monitoring high-risk individuals, which could potentially be used to halt the development of HCC.",1
"This phase 1–2 study evaluated brentuximab vedotin (BV) combined with nivolumab (Nivo) as first salvage therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). In parts 1 and 2, patients received staggered dosing of BV and Nivo in cycle 1, followed by same-day dosing in cycles 2 to 4. In part 3, both study drugs were dosed, same day, for all 4 cycles. At end of study treatment, patients could undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) per investigator discretion. The objective response rate (ORR; N = 91) was 85%, with 67% achieving a complete response (CR). At a median follow-up of 34.3 months, the estimated progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3 years was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65% to 86%) and 91% (95% CI, 79% to 96%) for patients undergoing ASCT directly after study treatment. Overall survival at 3 years was 93% (95% CI, 85% to 97%). The most common adverse events (AEs) prior to ASCT were nausea (52%) and infusion-related reactions (43%), all grade 1 or 2. A total of 16 patients (18%) had immune-related AEs that required systemic corticosteroid treatment. Peripheral blood immune signatures were consistent with an activated T-cell response. Median gene expression of CD30 in tumors was higher in patients who responded compared with those who did not. Longer-term follow-up of BV and Nivo as a first salvage regimen shows durable efficacy and impressive PFS, especially in patients who proceeded directly to transplant, without additional toxicity concerns. This trial was registered at  as #NCT02572167.","Aim: We aimed to investigate the predictive value of the Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) expression from circulating blood for recurrence, metastasis and overall death on patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Materials & Methods: We collected blood samples from 122 patients who were admitted to our hospital for NSCLC.Results: Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis in adjusted Model II showed that compared with GRHL2-negative expression, positive expression in patients with NSCLC was associated with increased death risk (HR = 7.0, 95% CI: 2.1–20.9, p = 0.03) and risk for composite end point (HR = 8.2, 95% CI: 4.0–27.1, p <0.01).Conclusion: This study supported that elevated circulating GRHL2 expression might be considered as a candidate prognostic biomarker for poor prognosis among these NSCLC patients.",0
"Chromosome instability (CIN) and subsequent aneuploidy are prevalent in various human malignancies, influencing tumor progression such as metastases and relapses. Extensive studies demonstrate the development of chemoresistance in high-CIN tumors, which poses significant therapeutic challenges. Given the association of CIN with poorer prognosis and suppressed immune microenvironment observed in colorectal carcinoma (CRC), here we aimed to discover chemotherapeutic drugs exhibiting increased inhibition against high-CIN CRC cells. By using machine learning methods, we screened out two BCL-XL inhibitors Navitoclax and WEHI-539 as CIN-sensitive reagents in CRC. Subsequent analyses using a CIN-aneuploidy cell model confirmed the vulnerability of high-CIN CRC cells to these drugs. We further revealed the critical role of BCL-XL in the viability of high-CIN CRC cells. In addition, to ease the evaluation of CIN levels in clinic, we developed a three-gene signature as a CIN surrogate to predict prognosis, chemotherapeutic and immune responses in CRC samples. Our results demonstrate the potential value of CIN as a therapeutic target in CRC treatment and the importance of BCL-XL in regulating survival of high-CIN CRC cells, therefore representing a valuable attempt to translate a common trait of heterogeneous tumor cells into an effective therapeutic target.","Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat in the medical field. Machine learning (ML) has enabled in-depth analysis of complex patterns from large, diverse datasets, greatly facilitating “healthcare automation” in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Despite these advancements, ML models face challenges stemming from limited labeled sample sizes, the intricate interplay of high-dimensionality data types, the inherent heterogeneity observed among patients and within tumors, and concerns about interpretability and consistency with existing biomedical knowledge. One approach to address these challenges is to integrate biomedical knowledge into data-driven models, which has proven potential to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of model results. Here, we review the state-of-the-art ML studies that leverage the fusion of biomedical knowledge and data, termed knowledge-informed machine learning (KIML), to advance cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We provide an overview of diverse forms of knowledge representation and current strategies of knowledge integration into machine learning pipelines with concrete examples. We conclude the review article by discussing future directions aimed at leveraging KIML to advance cancer research and healthcare automation.

"Purpose Tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) mutations are common in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We evaluated their clinical impact in patients treated with targeted agents or immunotherapy in the KCSG HN15-16 TRIUMPH trial.Materials and Methods We analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with TP53 mutations in the TRIUMPH trial, a multicenter, biomarker-driven umbrella trial in Korea. Patients were assigned to treatment groups based on genomic profiles: group 1, alpelisib; group 2, poziotinib; group 3, nintedanib; and group 4, abemaciclib. If there was no identifiable target, the patients were allocated to group 5 (durvalumab±tremelimumab).Results TP53 mutations were detected in 116/179 patients (64.8%), more frequently in human papillomavirus–negative and non-oropharyngeal cancers. Patients with TP53 mutations exhibited shorter progression-free survival than TP53 wild-type in all the patients (1.7 vs. 3.8 months, p=0.002) and in those who received targeted treatments (2.5 vs. 7.3 months, p=0.009). Furthermore, TP53 mutations were strongly associated with poor overall survival than TP53 wild-type in all the patients (11.1 vs. 28.8 months, p=0.005) and in group 5 (8.1 vs. 33.0 months, p=0.001).Conclusion TP53 mutations were associated with aggressive clinical characteristics and poor survival, particularly in HNSCC patients treated with immunotherapy.","Gastric cancer is still a major cancer worldwide. The early diagnosis rate of gastric cancer in most high incidence countries is low. At present, the overall treatment effect of gastric cancer is poor, and the median overall survival remains low. Most of the patients with gastric cancer are in an advanced stage when diagnosed, and drug treatment has become the main means. Thus, new targeted drugs and therapeutic strategies are the hope of improving the therapeutic effect of gastric cancer. In this review, we summarize the new methods and advances of targeted therapy for gastric cancer, including novel molecular targeted therapeutic agents and drug delivery systems, with a major focus on the development of drug delivery systems (drug carriers and targeting peptides). Elaborating these new methods and advances will contribute to the management of gastric cancer.",1
"Although autophagy sequesters intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in in vitro cultured macrophages, loss of autophagy in macrophages in vivo does not result in susceptibility to a standard low-dose Mtb infection until late during infection, leaving open questions regarding the protective role of autophagy during Mtb infection. We report herein that loss of autophagy in lung macrophages and dendritic cells results in acute susceptibility of mice to high-dose Mtb infection, a model better mimicking active tuberculosis. However, rather than observing a role for autophagy in controlling Mtb replication in macrophages, we find that autophagy suppresses macrophage responses to Mtb infection that otherwise result in the accumulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells and subsequent defects in T cell responses. Our finding that the pathogen-plus-susceptibility gene interaction is dependent on dose has important implications on understanding how Mtb infections in humans lead to a spectrum of outcomes and the potential use of autophagy modulators in clinical medicine.","The utilization of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, specifically anti-PD-1/L1 agents, prior to radical cystectomy is an emerging paradigm in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

"PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.","PurposeExisting biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.MethodsAn animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.ResultsWe identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes (RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and metastasis.ConclusionThe model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04495-z.",1

This study aimed to identify prognostic factors for SPPCa patients and develop nomograms to assess their prognosis.MethodsPatients diagnosed with SPPCa between 2010 and 2015 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The study cohort was randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan‒Meier survival analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis were used to identify independent prognostic factors and develop the nomogram. The nomograms were evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, area under the curve (AUC), and Kaplan–Meier analysis.ResultsA total of 5342 SPPCa patients were included in the study. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were identified as age, interval between diagnoses, first primary tumor site, and AJCC stage, N stage, M stage, PSA, Gleason score, and SPPCa surgery. Nomograms were constructed based on these prognostic factors, and the performance was evaluated using the C-index (OS: 0.733, CSS: 0.838), AUC, calibration curve, and Kaplan–Meier analysis, which demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy.ConclusionWe successfully established and validated nomograms to predict OS and CSS in SPPCa patients using the SEER database.

"This review discusses the eco-friendly and cost-effective biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in viable microorganisms, focusing on microbes-mediated AuNP biosynthesis. This process suits agricultural, environmental, and biomedical applications, offering renewable, eco-friendly, non-toxic, sustainable, and time-efficient methods. Microorganisms are increasingly used in green technology, nanotechnology, and RNAi technology, but several microorganisms have not been fully identified and characterized. Bio-nanotechnology offers eco-friendly and sustainable solutions for nanomedicine, with microbe-mediated nanoparticle biosynthesis producing AuNPs with anti-oxidation activity, stability, and biocompatibility. Ultrasmall AuNPs offer rapid distribution, renal clearance, and enhanced permeability in biomedical applications. The review explores nano-size dependent biosynthesis of AuNPs by bacteria, fungi, and viruses revealing their non-toxic, non-genotoxic, and non-oxidative properties on human cells. AuNPs with varying sizes and shapes, from nitrate reductase enzymes, have shown potential as a promising nano-catalyst. The synthesized AuNPs, with negative charge capping molecules, have demonstrated antibacterial activity against drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains, and were non-toxic to Vero cell lines, indicating potential antibiotic resistance treatments. A green chemical method for the biosynthesis of AuNPs using reducing chloroauric acid and Rhizopus oryzae protein extract has been described, demonstrating excellent stability and strong catalytic activity. AuNPs are eco-friendly, non-toxic, and time-efficient, making them ideal for biomedical applications due to their antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antibacterial properties. In addition to the biomedical application, the review also highlights the role of microbially synthesized AuNPs in sustainable management of plant diseases, and environmental bioremediation.","One in six deaths worldwide is caused by cancer, making it a major global health concern. Despite their effectiveness, traditional treatment approaches such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery frequently have negative side effects and high costs. New approaches, such as gene therapy, are promising but are hampered by high costs and accessibility problems. Nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate targeted drug delivery by leveraging passive targeting mechanisms, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and by actively targeting surfaces with ligands for site-specific binding through the functionalization of surfaces. This approach enhances therapeutic results while lowering off-target toxicities. Notably, chemotherapeutic medications, immunotherapeutic agents, and photothermal therapies can now be delivered more precisely to the affected site using NP-based systems. By boosting particularity, reducing side effects, and tackling drug resistance, nanomedicine has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and ultimately advance personalized oncological care. These advancements highlight the possibilities for field growth, and future development regulations are detailed.",1
"Adolescents are a growing population of people living with HIV. The period between weaning and sexual debut presents a low-risk window for HIV acquisition, making early childhood an ideal time for implementing an immunization regimen. Because the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is critical for an effective HIV vaccine, our goal was to assess the ability of a bnAb B cell lineage-designed HIV envelope SOSIP (protein stabilized by a disulfide bond between gp120-gp41—named “SOS”—and an isoleucine-to-proline point mutation—named “IP”—at residue 559) to induce precursor CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-targeting bnAbs in early life. Infant rhesus macaques received either a BG505 SOSIP, based on the infant BG505 transmitted/founder virus, or the CD4bs germ line-targeting BG505 SOSIP GT1.1 (n = 5 per group). Although both strategies induced durable, high-magnitude plasma autologous virus neutralization responses, only GT1.1-immunized infants (n = 3 of 5) exhibited VRC01-like CD4bs bnAb precursor development. Thus, a multidose immunization regimen with bnAb lineage-designed SOSIPs shows promise for inducing early B cell responses with the potential to mature into protective HIV bnAbs before sexual debut.","Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts that play a role in numerous malignant phenotypes, including hyperproliferation, invasion, and metastasis. These phenotypes correlate with activity of the Hippo pathway oncoprotein, Yes-associated protein-1 (YAP1), and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). YAP1/TAZ are normally involved in organ growth, under the regulation of various kinases and upon phosphorylation, are retained in the cytoplasm by chaperone proteins, leading to their proteasomal degradation. In CAFs and tumor cells, however, a lack of YAP1 phosphorylation results in its translocation to the nucleus, binding to TEAD transcription factors, and activation of mitogenic pathways. In this review we summarize the literature discussing the central role of YAP1 in CAF activation, the upstream cues that promote YAP1-mediated CAF activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and how CAFs mediate tumor-stroma crosstalk to support progression, invasion and metastasis in various cancer models. We further highlight YAP1+CAFs functions in modulating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and propose evaluation of several YAP1 targets regarding their role in regulating intra-tumoral immune landscapes. Finally, we propose that co-administration of YAP1- targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with advanced tumors.",0
"Genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells have become an effective treatment option for several advanced B-cell malignancies. Hematologic side effects, recently classified as immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), are very common and can predispose for clinically relevant infections. As hematopoietic reconstitution after CAR-T differs from chemotherapy-associated myelosuppression, a novel classification system for early and late ICAHT has been introduced. Furthermore, a risk-stratification score named CAR-HEMATOTOX has been developed to identify high-risk candidates, thereby enabling risk-based interventional strategies. Therapeutically, growth factor support with G-CSF represents the mainstay of treatment, with hematopoietic stem cell boosts available in G-CSF refractory cases. While the underlying pathophysiology remains enigmatic, recent translational studies suggest that CAR-T induced inflammation and baseline hematopoietic function are key contributors to prolonged cytopenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the spectrum of hematologic toxicities after CAR T-cell therapy and offer perspectives on future translational and clinical developments.","ABSTRACTLymphoma, a blood tumor, has become the ninth most common cancer in the world in 2020.

This article mainly expounds the important role of these target protein in tumors, and introduces the mechanism of action, structure–activity relationship and clinical research of listed small molecule inhibitors of these targets, hoping to provide new ideas for the treatment of lymphoma.",1
"PurposeCervical cancer (CC) patients are more likely to develop second primary malignancies (SPMs) than general population. With the advancement in cancer therapy, CC patients are achieving long-term survival, leading SPMs to our attention. Our study aims to establish diagnostic and prognostic nomograms for CC patients with second primary malignancies (CCSPMs) to help make personalized follow-up plans and treatments.MethodsData of CCSPMs between 2000 and 2019 was extracted from SEER. The proportions and the median interval time of CCSPM onset were calculated. 11 related clinical characteristics, including age, race, marital status, grade, FIGO stage, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, were further explore. Logistic and Cox regressions were employed to predict risk factors for CCSPMs diagnosis. Finally, two nomograms were developed to predict the probability occurrence and prognosis of CCSPMs, respectively.ResultsFor diagnostic nomogram construction, 59,178 CC patients were randomly divided into training (n = 41,426) and validation cohorts (n = 17,752). For prognostic nomogram construction, 3527 CCSPMs patients were randomly divided into training (n = 2469) and validation cohorts (n = 1058). The diagnostic nomogram consisting of above 11 independent risk factors (all P < 0.05), had high accuracy (AUCtraining = 0.851 and AUCvalidating = 0.845). The prognostic nomogram integrated with eight independent prognostic factors such as treatments, FIGO stage and TNM stage performed well in predicting 5-year OS (AUCtraining = 0.835 and AUCvalidating = 0.837).ConclusionOur diagnostic and prognostic nomograms could facilitate clinicians to quantify individual SPMs risk and survival probabilities and optimize the surveillance recommendations and personalized clinical decision-making.","BackgroundCD177, an indicator of prognosis in diverse cancers, is involved in the physiological processes of various tumor cells, and acts as an immune molecule with novel functions in cancer pathogenesis. However, the diagnostic, prognostic, and immunological role of CD177 in cervical cancer remains unclear.MethodsUtilizing publicly available databases and integrating several bioinformatics analysis methods, we evaluated the expression level of CD177 in cervical cancer by GENT2, HPA, and GEO databases. And the experiments of western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to test the hypothesis. The Kaplan–Meier Plotter database, Xena Shiny, and the constructed nomogram were clearly demonstrated its prognostic value for patients. Gene set enrichment analysis explored the relationship between CD177 and cervical cancer immune responses and immune cells infiltration level. In addition, we investigated the association between CD177 expression and stromal score, immune score, immune checkpoint, and drug sensitivity by TCGA RNA-seq data.ResultsCD177 was apparently expressed at low levels in cervical cancer and predicted a poor survival rate for patients. CD177 significantly activated immune-related signaling pathways and had a positive relationship with immune cell infiltration level. The high CD177 expression group possessed the high stromal score and immune score. CD177 had potential interactions with CTLA4, CD27, BLTA, CD200R1, CD80, NRP1, TNFRSF25, TIGIT, ICOS, and TNFSF9 checkpoint markers. And CD177 expression was positively relevant with drug sensitivity for Lapatinib, Belinostat, ATRA, Gefitinib, Navitoclax, and Tamoxifen.SignificanceThese findings may shed light on the vital role of CD177 in cervical cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and immunological functions, and it may be a promising predictor and potential factor for cervical cancer patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04465-5.",1
"Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) is a regional chemotherapy technique used in the treatment of locally advanced or unresectable extremity soft tissue sarcoma (ESTS) or malignant melanoma (MM) of the limbs. It allows for high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents to be perfused in the limb while minimising the risk of systemic side-effects. While the technique has been utilized for decades, the role of ILP has evolved as other treatment strategies have become available. Current indications for ILP in sarcoma include induction in unresectable ESTS to allow for future definitive limb preservation procedures as well as definitive treatment of unresectable, multifocal ESTS. In MM, ILP is typically used in unresectable in-transit melanoma, and rarely as an alternative to amputation in bulky, symptomatic extremity disease. This review seeks to summarise the current evidence base and indications for ILP as well as present some technical insights from a high-volume United Kingdom (UK) unit.","BackgroundThe progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) family contains 11 genes involved in the regulation of metabolism and cancer development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAQRs in cancer remains largely scarce, and the associations between their expression levels and immune signatures also need to be researched.MethodsHere, we applied pan-cancer analysis to explore the associations between PAQRs expression and survival, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity from the UCSC Xena and CellMiner databases. Besides, we further studied the expression, survival and somatic mutations of PAQRs in lung cancer (LC) from TCGA database.ResultsThe results showed that PAQRs had significant heterogeneity with some upregulation and some downregulation in most tumors. Specifically, compared with PAQR3/5/6/9 and MMD2, ADIPOR1/2, PAQR4/7/8 and MMD had higher levels of average expression in all tumor types. PAQRs expression was greatly correlated with survival, immune subtypes, TME, and drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this research concentrated on analyzing the relationship of PAQRs expression with LC prognosis, and proved that ADIPOR2, PAQR4/9 and MMD were independent prognostic factors for LC patients. Finally, based on somatic mutation data, the genetic mutations in LC patients were majorly missense mutations, and TP53 and TTN had the top two highest mutation frequencies.ConclusionCollectively, PAQRs may serve as robust biomarkers to predict the prognosis and guide immunotherapy of tumors, especially LC, which enables novel ways for improving cancer treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04922-9.",0
"Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine whether MRI radiomic features of key cerebral structures differ between women and men, and whether detection of such differences depends on the image resolution.Materials and Methods:Ultrahigh resolution (UHR) 3D MP2RAGE (magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo) T1-weighted MR images (voxel size, 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm3) of the brain of 30 subjects (18 women and 12 men; mean age, 39.0 ± 14.8 years) without abnormal findings on MRI were retrospectively included. MRI was performed on a whole-body 7 T MR system. A convolutional neural network was used to segment the following structures: frontal cortex, frontal white matter, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and corpus callosum. Eighty-seven radiomic features were extracted respectively: gray-level histogram (n = 18), co-occurrence matrix (n = 24), run-length matrix (n = 16), size-zone matrix (n = 16), and dependence matrix (n = 13). Feature extraction was performed at UHR and, additionally, also after resampling to 1.4 × 1.4 × 1.4 mm3 voxel size (standard clinical resolution). Principal components (PCs) of radiomic features were calculated, and independent samples t tests with Cohen d as effect size measure were used to assess differences in PCs between women and men for the different cerebral structures.Results:At UHR, at least a single PC differed significantly between women and men in 6/7 cerebral structures: frontal cortex (d = −0.79, P = 0.042 and d = −1.01, P = 0.010), frontal white matter (d = −0.81, P = 0.039), thalamus (d = 1.43, P < 0.001), globus pallidus (d = 0.92, P = 0.020), caudate nucleus (d = −0.83, P = 0.039), and corpus callosum (d = −0.97, P = 0.039). At standard clinical resolution, only a single PC extracted from the corpus callosum differed between sexes (d = 1.05, P = 0.009).Conclusions:Nonnegligible differences in radiomic features of several key structures of the brain exist between women and men, and need to be accounted for. Very high spatial resolution may be required to uncover and further investigate the sexual dimorphism of brain structures on MRI.","Although small-molecule inhibitors with moderate efficacy targeting MYC have been previously described, to this point, research efforts have failed to bring a suitable small-molecule MYC inhibitor to the clinic. Herein, the discovery of a series of novel MYC degraders bearing VHL to target the “undruggable” MYC is presented. The molecules are based on connecting a known MYC binder to a VHL ligand or pomalidomide to induce MYC degradation in various cancer cells known to express MYC. Representative compounds from our work induced MYC degradation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Selected compounds, CSI86 and CSI107, displayed antiproliferative activity (IC50 values of 13–18 μM) against breast and prostate cancer cells. The lead molecules were further evaluated in terms of cell uptake, potential to degrade MYC, and pharmacokinetics in mice. Encouraging results presented herein suggest that the presented analogs may serve as prototype structures of future therapeutic agents for the treatment of MYC-dependent tumors. MYC protein degraders can well complement the more established inhibition approaches that have been presented in the past (for example, disruption of the MYC–MAX complex formation by small-molecule inhibitors).",0
"Background:Large population-based registries, such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Registry, help in the study of rare tumors, including medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), but lack data to understand the natural history of the disease. The Medullary Thyroid Cancer Collaborative Registry (MTCCoRe) is an exhaustive multi-institutional collection of demographic, clinical, and pathological data. To determine the extent to which MTCCoRe represents the real-world MTC population, we compared the characteristics of patients enrolled in MTCCoRe with patients enrolled in population-based cancer registries.Methods:Comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics of MTC patients who were enrolled in MTCCoRe, Texas Cancer Registry (TCR), California Cancer Registry (CCR), and SEER between 1995 and 2018.Results:A total of 1416 patients were identified in MTCCoRe, 329 in TCR, 2105 in CCR, and 3820 in SEER. Percentages of patients 20–54 years in MTCCoRe were 58.0%, 50.2% in TCR, 47.2% in CCR, and 44.8% in SEER (p < 0.0001). About half of the patients were female (55.9% in MTCCoRe, 61.4% in TCR, 59% in CCR, and 57.5% in SEER (p = 0.3). Percentages of Hispanic and Black patients differed among cohorts (10.1% and 3.8% for MTCCoRe, 23.7% and 8.2% for TCR, 24.8% and 4.9% in CCR, and 15.9% and 8.2% for SEER, respectively; p < 0.001). MTCCoRe patients presented with more advanced T and N classifications than patients in the other registries (MTCCoRe, 28.6% T3-4 and 49.4% N1; TCR, 12.7% and 32.2%; CCR, 18.6% and 32.4%; and SEER, 24% and 37.8%; p < 0.0001). Prevalence of M1 disease was 10% in MTCCoRe, 11.9% in TCR, 14.1% in CCR, and 9.5% in SEER (p < 0.0001). In the MTCCoRe, 11.4% underwent systemic therapy (compared with 0.3% in TCR and 5.6% in CCR).Conclusions:The clinicodemographic profile of patients with MTC enrolled in a multi-institutional registry differs from those enrolled in population-based databases, with lower proportions of Hispanic and Black patients but additive data on treatment modalities. Moving forward, MTCCoRe and other registry and clinical trial enrollment efforts should intentionally include underrepresented groups via community engagement techniques, patient stakeholder involvement, and inclusion of languages other than English in study materials to yield more generalizable results and conclusions.","SUMMARYExtracellular 2’3’-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is an immunotransmitter exported by diseased cells and imported into host cells to activate the innate immune STING pathway. We previously identified SLC19A1 as a cGAMP importer, but its use across human cell lines is limited. Here, we identify LRRC8A heteromeric channels, better known as volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as widely-expressed cGAMP transporters. LRRC8A forms complexes with LRRC8C and/or LRRC8E, depending on their expression levels, to transport cGAMP and other 2’3’-cyclic dinucleotides. In contrast, LRRC8D inhibits cGAMP transport. We demonstrate that cGAMP is effluxed or influxed via LRRC8 channels, as dictated by the cGAMP electrochemical gradient. Activation of LRRC8A channels, which can occur under diverse stresses, strongly potentiates cGAMP transport. We identify activator sphingosine 1-phosphate and inhibitor DCPIB as chemical tools to manipulate channel-mediated cGAMP transport. Finally, LRRC8A channels are key cGAMP transporters in resting primary human vasculature cells and universal human cGAMP transporters when activated.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with clinical benefit in lung cancer. However, response patterns to immunotherapy, including pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, are difficult to diagnose, and their mechanisms remain unclear. This review aimed to describe two response patterns observed in lung cancer, namely pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, including their epidemiology, diagnostic characteristics, and plausible mechanisms.MethodsWe performed a comprehensive literature search in the PubMed database, using keywords “pseudoprogression”, “hyperprogression”, and “lung cancer”, among others. The literature was examined for pseudoprogression and hyperprogression characteristics and plausible mechanisms.ResultsPseudoprogression manifests in multiple forms; however, the immune system-related response criteria and biopsy data are helpful to make accurate diagnosis. Serological biomarkers, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), might help distinguish pseudoprogression from true progression. The incidence of hyperprogression ranges within 5–19.2%, depending on definition. The unique response pattern of rapid progression is observed not only with immunotherapy, but also with other treatment regimens. Molecular mutations and amplifications may result in hyperprogression; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear.ConclusionAtypical response patterns, such as pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, are increasingly common in clinical practice. Immune-related response criteria can help diagnose pseudoprogression. Molecular mechanisms of hyperprogression remain unclear. Biomarkers for pseudoprogression and hyperprogression are required.","AbstractCardiac ageing is an intricate and multifaceted process with considerable impact on public health, especially given the global demographic shift towards aged populations. This review discusses structural, cellular, and functional changes associated with cardiac ageing and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Key molecular mediators are considered within the framework of the established hallmarks of ageing, with particular attention to promising therapeutic candidates. We further delineate the differential impacts of ageing on cardiac structure and function in men and women, addressing hormonal and chromosomal influences. The protective and mitigating effects of exercise in cardiac ageing and HFpEF in particular are discussed, as an inspiration for the identification of pathways that mitigate biological ageing. We also emphasize how much remains to be learned and the importance of these efforts in enhancing the cardiac health of ageing populations worldwide.",0
"The liver plays a crucial role in immune system regulation, but dysregulation of immunological networks contributes to chronic liver diseases like hepatocellular carcinoma. This malignant tumor is the third leading cause of cancer death. An imbalanced immune system, characterized by alterations in immune cell count, cytokine levels, and inhibitory receptors, can impact metastasis by suppressing the immune system's ability to fight cancer cells. This study aims to investigate the potential biomarkers playing a crucial role in immune dysregulation resulting in hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis. A comprehensive and systematic literature review was conducted using both free words and search terms. The data extraction was then performed by a thorough literature screening. Next, the meta-analysis was performed using the metabin function of the meta library in R to evaluate the patient cases reporting metastasis in the event group. A total of 1,008 cases were considered, with 357 as events and 651 as nonevents. The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated the significant role of biomarkers in immune dysregulation causing metastasis (risk ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.4972, 0.6048, I 2 = 92.4%, p < 0.01). In addition to the immune dysregulation explored in this study, the impact of tumor size on hepatocellular carcinoma progression and metastasis is a crucial consideration. A notable difference of 41 more cases was reported for larger tumor sizes. The study integrates immune dysregulation biomarkers and tumor size factors influencing hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis, offering valuable insights for future research and therapeutic interventions for improved clinical outcomes.","AbstractWith the epidemic of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent liver disease in the world. And the dysregulation of the metabolic microenvironment provides a favorable environment for the occurrence of liver cancer. In recent years, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by NAFLD is on the rise, especially in the United States, the UK, and France, where it is the fastest-growing cause of HCC. And due to the absence of disruptive symptoms in the early period and the lack of adequate surveillance in the population without cirrhosis, NAFLD associated-HCC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage with larger tumors and lower cure rates, causing a substantial economic and social burden. Although many factors contribute to the occurrence and development of NAFLD-related HCC, the specific pathogenesis is still unclear. In this review, we focus on the research progress of its pathogenesis in recent years, including the role of insulin resistance, lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, gut microbiota, autophagy, the activation of the immune system, and hormonal disorders.",1
"BackgroundSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine cancer with a high risk of early mortality (that is, survival time less than 1 month). This study aimed to identify relevant risk factors and predict early mortality in SCLC patients.MethodsA total of 27,163 SCLC cases registered between 2010 and 2019 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Significant independent risk factors were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Nomograms for all-causes and cancer-specific early death were constructed and evaluated.ResultsAge, sex, clinical stage, presence of metastasis (liver and lung), and absence of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) were identified for significant association with all-causes and cancer-specific early death. Nomograms based on these predictors exhibited high accuracy (area under ROC curve > 0.850) and potential clinical practicality in the prediction of early mortality.ConclusionWe identified a set of factors associated with early mortality from SCLC and developed a clinically useful nomogram to predict high-risk patients. This nomogram could aid oncologists in the administration of individualized treatment regimens, potentially improving clinical outcomes of SCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05003-7.","Efferocytosis, the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses and effectively prevents secondary necrosis. However, the mechanisms underlying efferocytosis in acute pancreatitis (AP) remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of efferocytosis in injured human and mouse pancreatic tissues. We also observed significant upregulation of CD47, an efferocytosis-related the ""do not eat me"" molecule in injured acinar cells. Subsequently, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, anti-adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene modification, and anti-CD47 antibody to investigate the potential therapeutic role of AP. CD47 expression was negatively regulated by upstream miR133a, which is controlled by the transcription factor TRIM28. To further investigate the regulation of efferocytosis and reduction of pancreatic necrosis in AP, we used miR-133a-agomir and pancreas-specific AAV-shTRIM28 to modulate CD47 expression. Our findings confirmed that CD47-mediated efferocytosis is critical for preventing pancreatic necrosis and suggest that targeting the TRIM28-miR133a-CD47 axis is clinically relevant for the treatment of AP.",0
"ABSTRACTOvarian cancer remains one of the main causes of human mortality, accounting for millions of deaths every year. Despite of several clinical options such as chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), hormonal treatment, radiation therapy, and surgery to manage this disease, the mortality rate is still very high. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for innovative approaches to improve both diagnosis and treatment. Success stories of iron oxide nanoparticles, that is Ferucarbotran (Resovist®) and Ferrixan (Cliavist®) for liver imaging, CNS (Central nervous system) imaging, cell labeling, etc. have motivated researchers to explore these nanocarriers for treatment and diagnosis of different diseases. Iron oxide nanoparticles have improved the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs through targeted delivery, heat/ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation on application of external energy and have also shown great potential as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their unique magnetic properties enable sensitive imaging, and surface modification allows the attachment of specific biomolecules for targeted detection of ovarian cancer cells. Their unique properties, viz. magnetic responsiveness and surface functionalization, make them versatile tools for enhancing both imaging and therapeutic outcomes. Present article reviews the literature on the synthesis, functionalization, and applications of iron oxide nanoparticles in management of ovarian cancer.","AbstractTheranostics is a new treatment modality integrating molecular imaging with targeted radionuclide therapy. Theranostic agents have received regulatory approval for some systemic cancers and have therapeutic potential in neuro-oncology. As clinical trials are developed to evaluate the efficacy of theranostic agents in brain tumors, specific considerations will have to be considered, taking into account lessons learned from previous studies examining other treatment modalities in neuro-oncology. These include the need for molecular imaging or surgical window-of-opportunity studies to confirm adequate passage across the blood-brain barrier, optimize eligibility criteria, and selection of the most appropriate response criteria and endpoints to address issues such as pseudoprogression. This review will discuss some of the issues that should be considered when designing clinical trials for theranostic agents.",1
"ABSTRACTMillions of people worldwide suffer from cancer, facing challenges such as treatments affecting healthy cells, suboptimal responses, adverse effects, recurrence risk, drug resistance, and nonspecific targeting. Chemoresistance leads to fatalities, but phytoactives show promise in cancer management despite limitations such as high metabolism, poor absorption, and high dosage requirements. Challenges in the large-scale isolation of phytoactive compounds, solubility, bioavailability, and targeting limit their development. Recent developments, including carbohydrate, lipid, and protein-based nanoparticles, have enhanced cancer treatment by improving the bioavailability and targeted delivery of phytoactives such as polyphenols, alkaloids, sulfur-containing compounds, flavonoids, and terpenes. Despite advancements, clinical application faces hurdles such as poor bioavailability and inconsistent immune responses. This article discusses the promise of phytoactive-loaded nanoformulations in cancer management, highlighting targeted drug delivery, unmet needs, and challenges. Further research is needed to overcome these challenges and fully understand the potential of phytoactives in cancer management.","Oesophageal cancer (EC), ranking 11th in incidence and 7th in mortality globally, presents a significant health challenge, with a notable prevalence in India, especially in the northeastern region. This article examines the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in treating locally advanced EC, analyzing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between 2000 and 2024. NACRT, involving preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, has shown improved survival rates, notably in the CROSS trial, which reported a 10-year overall survival benefit of 13%. Conversely, NACT is supported by key trials like the OE02 and MAGIC trials, demonstrating comparable survival outcomes. Key points of debate include compliance, complications, response and resection status, survival rates, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Compliance rates are similar for both modalities, though disease progression is more common after NACT. Postoperative complications and mortality rates are comparable, with NACTRT showing higher pathologic complete response (pCR) and R0 resection rates, potentially avoiding additional adjuvant radiation. While NACRT shows marginally better 3-year survival rates, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma, 5-year survival rates and HRQOL outcomes are similar for both treatments. NACTRT is associated with more respiratory symptoms, whereas NACT patients experience more gastrointestinal issues. Both NACT and NACTRT are viable options, with the choice depending on patient-specific factors and a thorough assessment of potential benefits and risks. Further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols for EC.",1
"AbstractIntroductionThe phase 3 LEAP-002 study (NCT03713593) of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggested improved antitumor activity of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus lenvatinib alone with manageable safety, although overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) did not reach prespecified statistical significance. This post hoc analysis assessed efficacy and safety in Japanese patients.MethodsPatients with advanced HCC without prior systemic treatment were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 8 mg (body weight <60 kg) or 12 mg (body weight ≥60 kg) oral lenvatinib once daily plus 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Dual primary end points were OS and PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary end points were objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and time to progression per RECIST v1.1 by BICR and safety.ResultsOverall, 80 patients were enrolled in Japan (lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, n = 39; lenvatinib plus placebo, n = 41). Median time from randomization to database cutoff (June 21, 2022) was 34.1 months (range: 26.9–39.6). Median OS was 31.4 months (95% CI: 21.2– not reached) for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 21.4 months (95% CI: 14.4–25.4) for lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.55 [95% CI: 0.31–0.96]). Median PFS for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was 10.4 months (95% CI: 6.2–18.5) and 6.5 months (95% CI: 6.0–8.3) for lenvatinib plus placebo (HR = 0.54 [95% CI: 0.32–0.90]). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 26 patients (67%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 24 patients (59%) in the lenvatinib plus placebo group.ConclusionIn Japanese patients enrolled in LEAP-002, findings were consistent with the global population where OS and PFS trended toward improvement; a similar safety profile was observed.","PurposeIn recent times, multiple molecular subtypes with varying prognoses have been identified in bladder cancer (BLCA). However, the attributes of butyrate metabolism-related (BMR) molecular subtypes and their correlation with immunotherapy response remain inadequately explored in BLCA.MethodsWe utilized 594 samples of BLCA to investigate the molecular subtypes mediated by BMR genes and their correlation with the immunotherapy response. To quantify the BMR features of individual tumors, we developed a BMR score through the COX and LASSO regression methods. Clinical-related, tumor microenvironment, drug-sensitive and immunotherapy analyses were used to comprehensively analyze BMR scores.ResultsTwo distinct molecular subtypes related to butyrate metabolism were identified in BLCA, each with unique prognostic implications and immune microenvironments. BMR score was constructed based on 7 BMR genes and was used to classify the patients into two score groups. Clinical analysis revealed that the BMR score was an independent prognostic factor. The higher the score, the worse the prognosis. The BMR score can also predict tumor immunity. The results demonstrated that a low BMR score was associated with higher efficacy of immunotherapy, which was also validated by an external dataset.ConclusionOur study proposes both molecular subtypes and a BMR-based score as promising prognostic classifications in BLCA. These findings may offer new insights for the development of precise targeted cancer therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05067-5.",0
"Traditionally, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was considered a radioresistant tumor, thereby limiting definitive radiation therapy management options. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can achieve high rates of local control for the treatment of primary RCC. In the setting of an expanding use of SBRT for primary RCC, it is crucial to provide guidance on practical considerations such as patient selection, fractionation, target delineation, and response assessment. This is particularly important in challenging scenarios where a paucity of evidence exists, such as in patients with a solitary kidney, bulky tumors, or tumor thrombus. The Radiosurgery Society endorses this case-based guide to provide a practical framework for delivering SBRT to primary RCC, exemplified by three cases. This article explores topics of tumor size and dose fractionation, impact on renal function and treatment in the setting of a solitary kidney, and radiation’s role in the management of inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. Additionally, we review existing evidence and expert opinion on target delineation, advanced techniques like MRI-guided SBRT, and SBRT response assessment.","PurposePostmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with T1–2N1 breast cancer is still controversial. This study was to evaluate the survival prognosis of T1-2N1 patients with or without PMRT.Patients and methodsFrom January 2006 to May 2017, 2606 female breast cancer patients underwent mastectomy in our medical center, among whom 402 patients of T1-2N1 stage with or without PMRT were finally analyzed. The median follow-up duration was 59.5 months. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS).ResultsIn the study of our center, no statistically significant difference was observed between the T1-2N1 PMRT and non-PMRT subgroups for the 5-year OS (94.4% vs 95.4%, p = 0.667) and DFS (90.1% vs. 91.1%, p = 0.798). By the date of the last follow-up, 8.96% (n = 36) of the patients experienced any recurrence. Univariate analysis revealed that PMRT was not a prognostic factor for either OS (p = 0.667) or DFS (p = 0.798) in T1-2N1 patients. We then did a meta-analysis on the current treatment patterns, in which 2606 PMRT and 4281 non-PMRT T1-2N1 breast cancer patients with mastectomy were included. The meta-analysis showed that PMRT didn't improve the OS of the patients (HR = 0.85, p = 0.11), but patients with PMRT had better DFS than those in the non-PMRT group (HR = 0.62, p < 0.001).ConclusionPMRT did not affect the survival of T1-2N1 breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy, suggesting that radiotherapy may be safely omitted for them.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04908-7.",0
"BackgroundPreviously, albendazole (ABZ) has been reported as an anti-parasitic drug rather than anti-tumor drug. Our study aim to investigate whether ABZ also has a potential anti-tumor effect by shaping the tumor immune microenvironment and interrogate whether ABZ could synergize with the PD-L1 blockade.MethodsC57BL/6 mice (C57) were intravenously injected with B16F10-luciferase (B16-luc) cells to establish a lung metastatic melanoma model and subcutaneously inoculated with B16-luc cells to establish a subcutaneous tumor model. The tumor volume and tumor metastasis loci of the mice were measured by a vernier caliper and in vivo imaging. RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the different genes and pathways of immune cells in the tumors. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the different subsets of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.ResultsThe results suggested that ABZ significantly inhibited lung melanoma metastasis with decreased fluorescence intensity and nodule score and mediated the regression of subcutaneous melanoma in mice with decreased tumor volume. Moreover, RNA sequencing results showed that ABZ regulated the gene expression levels and pathways of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Meanwhile, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence showed that the number and percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells were enhanced in tumors after ABZ treatment. Furthermore, the combination of ABZ and anti-PD-L1 treatment significantly potentiated anti-tumor efficacy in both lung metastasis and subcutaneous melanoma models and mediated an increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and TH1 cells as compared to the control group.ConclusionABZ inhibits melanoma growth and metastasis. Moreover, ABZ synergized with PD-L1 blockade mediates tumor regression.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05415-5.","The association of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) with melanoma has been well documented. Similarly, the outcome of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) in melanoma depends, to some extent, on the HLA genotype of the patient. Although specific favorable (or unfavorable) HLA alleles for CBI outcome for melanoma have been identified, there is currently no reliable way to predict a positive, neutral or negative melanoma CBI outcome for other alleles. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to identify HLA alleles whose frequency is negatively (or positively) associated with melanoma prevalence (protective or susceptibility alleles, respectively). The findings demonstrated that, indeed, HLA alleles that are negatively associated with melanoma prevalence in the population have been associated with good CBI outcome at the individual level and, conversely, HLA alleles that are positively associated with melanoma prevalence have been associated with poor CBI outcome in individuals. Given this good prediction of CBI cancer immunotherapy by specific immunogenetically discovered HLA alleles, we used this epidemiologic immunogenetic approach to identify more HLA Class I and II alleles protective (or susceptibility) for melanoma which would thus be good predictors of CBI outcomes in those cancers. This is a new approach to successfully (a) identify HLA protective or susceptibility alleles for melanoma, and (b) use that information in anticipating outcomes in CBI cancer immunotherapy.",1
"Adjuvants for vaccines with characteristics of improving adaptive immunity particularly via leverage of antigen presenting cells (APCs) are currently lacking. In a previous work we obtained a new soluble 300 kDa homogeneous β-glucan named GFPBW1 from the fruit bodies of Granola frondosa. GFPBW1 could activate macrophages by targeting dendritic cell associated C-type lectin 1 (Dectin-1)/Syk/NF-κB signaling to achieve antitumour effects. In this study the adjuvant effects of GFPBW1 were explored with OVA-antigen and B16-OVA tumor model. We showed that GFPBW1 (5, 50, 500 μg/mL) dose-dependently promoted activation and maturation of APCs in vitro by increasing CD80, CD86 and MHC II expression. We immunized female mice with OVA in combination with GFPBW1 (50 or 300 μg) twice with an interval of two weeks. GFPBW1 markedly and dose-dependently increased OVA-specific antibody titers of different subtypes including IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, suggesting that it could serve as an adjuvant for both Th1 and Th2 type immune responses. Furthermore, GFPBW1 in combination with aluminum significantly increased the titers of OVA-specific IgG2a and IgG2b, but not those of IgG1, suggesting that GFPBW1 could be used as a co-adjuvant of aluminum to compensate for Th1 deficiency. For mice immunized with OVA plus GFPBW1, no obvious pathological injury was observed in either major organs or injection sites, and no abnormalities were noted for any of the hematological parameters. When GFPBW1 served as an adjuvant in the B16-OVA cancer vaccine models, it could accomplish entire tumor suppression with preventive vaccines, and enhance antitumour efficacy with therapeutic vaccines. Differentially expressed genes were found to be enriched in antigen processing process, specifically increased tumor infiltration of DCs, B1 cells and plasma cells in the OVA plus GFPBW1 group, in accordance with its activation and maturation function of APCs. Collectively, this study systematically describes the properties of GFPBW1 as a novel potent and safe adjuvant and highlights its great potential in vaccine development.","Recombinant protein vaccines offer an advantage without a safety risk in eliciting desired humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against infectious diseases. But one of their disadvantages is their low immunogenicity, thus requiring adjuvants that augment their immunogenicity. It is necessary to explore new technology that could provide a non-toxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible delivery system with adjuvant characteristics and nanotechnology provides an excellent platform for nanomaterial-based vaccine adjuvants. Here, we have synthesized a modified dipeptide, Arg-α, β-dehydrophenyalanine (RΔF) containing ΔF at its C-terminal, and characterized it using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and mass spectrometry techniques. RΔF upon its self-assembly to spherical nanoparticles (NPs) efficiently condensed a recombinant Plasmodium falciparum surface protein, histidine-tagged MSPFu24 (Fu24H). The morphological characteristics of the nanoparticle formulation was characterized using TEM. RΔF NPs and RΔF-Fu24H complex showed excellent in vitro biocompatibility toward two mammalian cell lines and human red blood cells (RBCs). Furthermore, mice treated with R∆F NPs showed histological and haematological properties similar to the untreated control group which indicated their very high in vivo biocompatibility. Mice treated with RΔF-Fu24H nanoformulation induced a high titers of anti-Fu24H specific antibodies and showed a mixed Th1 and Th2 profile, comparable to the FDA-approved adjuvant Alhydrogel®. The sera from immunized mice inhibited the erythrocyte invasion activity of P. falciparum’s laboratory line 3D7 in vitro which was comparable to that of Alhydrogel®. The present study suggests that the highly biocompatible dipeptide-based nanoparticle formulation can further be developed and used in clinic as a promising antigen delivery platform to elicit immune responses.",1
"PurposeDisparities in cognitive function among racial and ethnic groups have been reported in non-cancer conditions, but cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in racial and ethnic minority groups is poorly understood. We aimed to synthesize and characterize the available literature about CRCI in racial and ethnic minority populations.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review in the PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases. Articles were included if they were published in English or Spanish, reported cognitive functioning in adults diagnosed with cancer, and characterized the race or ethnicity of the participants. Literature reviews, commentaries, letters to the editor, and gray literature were excluded.ResultsSeventy-four articles met the inclusion criteria, but only 33.8% differentiated the CRCI findings by racial or ethnic subgroups. There were associations between cognitive outcomes and the participants’ race or ethnicity. Additionally, some studies found that Black and non-white individuals with cancer were more likely to experience CRCI than their white counterparts. Biological, sociocultural, and instrumentation factors were associated with CRCI differences between racial and ethnic groups.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that racial and ethnic minoritized individuals may be disparately affected by CRCI. Future research should use standardized guidelines for measuring and reporting the self-identified racial and ethnic composition of the sample; differentiate CRCI findings by racial and ethnic subgroups; consider the influence of structural racism in health outcomes; and develop strategies to promote the participation of members of racial and ethnic minority groups.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05088-0.","ABSTRACTAcute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous hematopoietic cancer prevalent in adults, has been a leading cause of leukemia-associated deaths for decades. Despite advancements in understanding its pathology and pharmacological targets, therapeutic strategies have seen minimal change.

"AbstractMost patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have limited treatment options following standard-of-care therapy. VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05425940 (ClinicalTrials.gov)","The immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1, commonly used in cancer immunotherapy, has not been successful as a monotherapy for the highly aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma. However, when used in conjunction with a CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) antagonist, anti-PD-1 has shown efficacy in preclinical studies. In this paper, we aim to optimize treatment regimens for this combination immunotherapy using optimal control theory. We extend a treatment-free glioblastoma-immune dynamics ODE model to include interventions with anti-PD-1 and the CCR2 antagonist. An optimized regimen increases the survival of an average mouse from 32 days post-tumor implantation without treatment to 111 days with treatment. We scale this approach to a virtual murine cohort to evaluate mortality and quality of life concerns during treatment, and predict survival, tumor recurrence, or death after treatment. A parameter identifiability analysis identifies five parameters suitable for personalizing treatment within the virtual cohort. Sampling from these five practically identifiable parameters for the virtual murine cohort reveals that personalized, optimized regimens enhance survival: 84% of the virtual mice survive to day 100, compared to 60% survival in a previously studied experimental regimen. Subjects with high tumor growth rates and low T cell kill rates are identified as more likely to die during and after treatment due to their compromised immune systems and more aggressive tumors. Notably, the MDSC death rate emerges as a long-term predictor of either disease-free survival or death.",0
"The advent of immune checkpoint inhibition has revolutionized treatment of advanced melanoma. While most patients derive survival benefit from established immunotherapies, notably monoclonal antibodies blocking cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programmed cell death protein 1, a subset does not optimally respond due to the manifestation of innate or acquired resistance to these therapies. Combination regimens have proven efficacious relative to single-agent blockade, but also yield high-grade treatment toxicities that are often dose-limiting for patients. In this review, we discuss the significant strides made in the past half-decade toward expanding the melanoma immunotherapy treatment paradigm. These include newly approved therapies, adoption of neoadjuvant immunotherapy, and studies in the clinical trials pipeline targeting alternative immune checkpoints and key immunoregulatory molecules. We then review how developments in molecular and functional diagnostics have furthered our understanding of the tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms driving immunotherapy resistance, as well as highlight novel biomarkers for predicting treatment response. Throughout, we discuss potential approaches for targeting these resistance mechanisms in rational combination with established immunotherapies to improve outcomes for patients with melanoma.","AbstractBackgroundBrain metastases (BM) portend increased morbidity and mortality in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We aimed to characterize the prevalence, timing, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes of BM associated with SCLC over the past decade.MethodsData from 4014 patients with histologically confirmed SCLC were extracted from the TriNetX Oncology database. Clinical and demographic variables were compared between patients with and without BM using Chi-squared and t-tests. Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate overall survival (OS), after propensity score matching cohorts for age at diagnosis, sex, cancer stage at diagnosis, extracranial metastases, and cancer-directed therapy.ResultsAmong 4014 patients with SCLC, 35.0% had BM (9.9% synchronous, 21.2% metachronous, 3.9% precocious). Patients who developed BM were younger (P < .001) at SCLC diagnosis, more likely Black/African American (P = .0068), and presented with more advanced cancer stages (P < .001) than patients who did not develop BM. The median BM-free survival from the time of SCLC diagnosis was 27.9 months. Patients with BM received higher rates of cancer-directed therapies than those without BM. Synchronous BM was associated with lower OS than metachronous BM after the diagnosis of SCLC (HR[95% CI] = 1.56[1.32–1.83]), but there was no difference in OS after the BM diagnosis. OS did not differ between patients with BM and patients with extracranial metastases only, following the diagnosis of metastatic disease.ConclusionsOur findings support that independently of the chronicity of BM diagnosis, patients with SCLC have poor survival once the diagnosis of BM is conferred.",0
"PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.","BackgroundLow-grade glioma (LGG) is a crucial pathological type of glioma. The present study aimed to explore multiple RNA methylation regulator-related AS events and investigate their prognostic values in LGG.MethodsThe prognostic model for low-grade glioma was established using the LASSO regression analysis. To validate prognostic value, we performed Kaplan–Maier survival analysis, ROC curves and nomograms. The ESTIMATE algorithm, the CIBERSORT algorithm and the ssGSEA algorithm were utilized to explore the role of the immune microenvironment in LGG. Subsequently, we then used GO, KEGG and GSEA enrichment analysis to explore the functional roles of these genes. In addition, we employed the GDSC database to screen potential chemotherapeutic agents.ResultsEight RNA methylation related AS events were involved in construct a survival and prognosis model, which had good ability of independent prediction for patients with LGG. Patients in the high-risk group had shorter life expectancy and higher mortality, while patients in the low-risk group had a better prognosis. We constructed a nomogram which showed an excellent predictive performance for individual OS. The risk score exhibited a close correlation with some immune cells and expression of immune checkpoints. Patients in high-risk group were characterized by immunosuppressive microenvironment and poor response to immunotherapy, and were sensitive to more chemotherapeutic drugs. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses further confirmed that significant differences existed in immune landscape between the two subgroups.ConclusionThe prognostic RNA methylation-related alternative splicing signature constructed could constitute a promising prognostic biomarker, which could serve to optimize treatment regimens.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04431-1.",1
"Despite significant advancement in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of breast carcinoma, the prognosis remains dismal. Recently, with advances in its understanding, various immune system-based management strategies have been developed. CTLA-4 suppresses lymphocyte reactivity, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2 receptor expression and triggers cell cycle arrest. PD-L1 inhibits the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibits release of cytokines. Hence, we planned to evaluate the immunoexpression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in invasive ductal carcinoma breast and seek correlation between their immunopositivity and the clinicopathological parameters. This was a retrospective study conducted on archival material of 50 cases of breast carcinoma tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological details were recorded. All cases were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Cytoplasmic expression of CTLA-4 and membranous expression of PD-L1 were considered positive and staining intensity was recorded as mild, moderate, and intense. Data was recorded and analyzed. Immunopositivity for CTLA-4 was seen in 92% of cases of breast carcinoma. CTLA-4 staining intensity showed significant association with TNM staging of breast carcinomas (p = 0.036). Age group of the breast carcinoma cases showed a statistically significant correlation with PD-L1 immunoexpression (p = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between all other clinicopathological characteristics and CTLA-4 or PD-L1 immunostaining. Our study shows that CTLA-4 is a more important immune checkpoint regulator in breast carcinomas in comparison to PD-L1. Thus, anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy might prove to be of immense help in the treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma breast showing overexpression of CTLA-4.","PurposeNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is ranked the top otorhinolaryngology malignant tumors in the world. However, the general prognosis of recurrent and metastatic (R/M) nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) remains poor, and current surgery and chemoradiotherapy do not generate satisfactory outcomes.MethodsAs a new therapeutic choice, immunotherapy, especially with regard to the development of checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors have made considerable progress in recent years. As Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with increased risk of NPC, EBV-related immunotherapy may lead to a breakthrough in advanced NPCs.ResultsIn this review, we summarized the clinical characters of NPC, and several past and ongoing clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors and EBV-CTLs (CTLs: cytotoxic T lymphocytes) in R/M NPC immunotherapy.ConclusionWe conclude that although the evaluated effects of new immunotherapy drugs have brought us hope on NPC treatment, further phase II-III trials with larger samples are still required to improve the proportion and scheme of drug collocation for better clinical outcomes and less drug-related safety.",1
"Background/aimsThe aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with robotic radiosurgery in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with macrovascular invasion (HCC-PVT).Materials and methodsPatients with inoperable HCC-PVT, good performance score (PS0-1) and preserved liver function [up to Child-Pugh (CP) B7] were accrued after ethical and scientific committee approval [Clinical trial registry-India (CTRI): 2022/01/050234] for treatment on robotic radiosurgery (M6) and planned with Multiplan (iDMS V2.0). Triple-phase contrast computed tomography (CT) scan was performed for contouring, and gross tumour volume (GTV) included contrast-enhancing mass within main portal vein and adjacent parenchymal disease. Dose prescription was as per risk stratification protocol (22–50 Gy in 5 fractions) while achieving the constraints of mean liver dose <15 Gy, 800 cc liver <8 Gy and the duodenum max of <24 Gy). Response assessment was done at 2 months’ follow-up for recanalization. Patient- and treatment-related factors were evaluated for influence in survival function.ResultsBetween Jan 2017 and May 2022, 318 consecutive HCC with PVT patients were screened and 219 patients were accrued [male 92%, CP score: 5–7 90%, mean age: 63 years (38–85 yrs), Cancer of the Liver Italian Program <3: 84 (40%), 3–6117 (56%), infective aetiology 9.5%, performance status (PS): 0–37%; 1–56%]. Among 209 consecutive patients accrued for SBRT treatment (10 patients were excluded after accrual due to ascites and decompensation), 139 were evaluable for response assessment (>2 mo follow-up). At mean follow-up of 12.21 months (standard deviation: 10.66), 88 (63%) patients expired and 51 (36%) were alive. Eighty-two (59%) patients had recanalization of PVT (response), 57 (41%) patients did not recanalize and 28 (17%) had progressive/metastatic disease prior to response evaluation (<2 months). Mean overall survival (OS) in responders and non-responders were 18.4 [standard error (SE): 2.52] and 9.34 month (SE 0.81), respectively (P < 0.001). Mean survival in patients with PS0, PS1 and PS2 were 17, 11.7 and 9.7 months (P = 0.019), respectively. OS in partial recanalization, bland thrombus and complete recanalization was 12.4, 14.1 and 30.3 months, respectively (P-0.002). Adjuvant sorafenib, Barcelona Clinic Liver Classification stage, gender, age and RT dose did not influence response to treatment. Recanalization rate was higher in good PS patients (P-0.019). OS in patients with response to treatment, in those with no response to treatment, in those who are fit but not accrued and in those who are not suitable were 18.4, 9.34, 5.9 and 2.6 months, respectively (P-<0.001). Thirty-six of 139 patients (24%) had radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) [10 (7.2%) had classic RILD & 26 (19%) had non-classic RILD]. Derangement in CP score (CP score change) by more than 2 was seen in 30 (24%) within 2-month period after robotic radiosurgery. Eighteen (13%) had unplanned admissions, two patients required embolization due to fiducial-related bleeding and 20 (14%) had ascites, of which 9 (6%) patients required abdominocentesis.ConclusionPVT response or recanalization after SBRT is a statistically significant prognostic factor for survival function in HCC-PVT.","Aim: This study investigated the role of lncRNA LINC01232 in ferroptosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials & methods: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blot experiments were performed to examine relevant mRNAs and proteins expression. The kit assays evaluated malondialdehyde, iron, Fe2+ and glutathione levels. ROS levels were verified by flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation analysis monitored the correlation among LINC01232, H3K27ac, p300 and ARNTL2.Results: LINC01232 or ARNTL2 knockdown facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis. The interaction between LINC01232 and p300 resulted in the enhancement of H3K27ac levels at ARNTL2 promoter to promote ARNTL2 transcriptional activity. ARNTL2 overexpression reversed the promoting effect of LINC01232 knockdown on ferroptosis.Conclusion: LINC01232 inhibited the ferroptosis in CRC by epigenetically upregulating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL2.",0
"Pleural mesothelioma (PM), a rare malignant tumor explicitly associated with asbestos and erionite exposures, has become a global health problem due to limited treatment options and a poor prognosis, in which the median life expectancy varies depending on the method of treatment. However, the importance of early diagnosis is emphasized, and the practical methods have not matured yet. This study provides a critical overview of PM, addressing various aspects like epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment options, and the potential use of advanced technologies like microfluidic chip-based models for research and diagnosis. It initially begins with fundamentals of clinical aspects and then discusses the identification of disease-specific biomarkers in patients’ serum or plasma samples, which could potentially be used for early diagnosis. A detailed investigation of the sophisticated preclinical models is highlighted. Recent three-dimensional (3D) model accomplishments, including microarchitecture modeling by transwell coculture, spheroids, organoids, 3D bioprinting constructs, and ex vivo tumor slices, are discussed comprehensively. On-chip models that imitate physiological processes, such as detection chips and therapeutic screening chips, are assessed as potential techniques. The review concludes with a critical and constructive discussion of the growing interest in the topic and its limitations and suggestions.","PurposeThis study was designed to evaluate the role and expression of MEK5 signalling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and to determine the relevance of MEK5 and mTOR signalling in ccRCC.MethodsThe expression of MEK5 was compared between ccRCC and normal tissues using the ONCOMINE and TCGA databases. MEK5 expression was evaluated in 14 human ccRCC samples. CCK8, wound-healing, and clone formation assays were performed to examine the cell proliferation, migration, and clone formation abilities of ccRCC cells treated with MEK5 and the inhibitor BIX02189. Furthermore, Western blotting was performed to verify the regulation and influence of MEK5 on the mTOR signalling pathway. Finally, a murine subcutaneous tumour model was constructed, and the effect and safety of BIX02189 were evaluated in vivo.ResultsThe ONCOMINE and TCGA databases indicated that MEK5 expression in ccRCC was significantly higher than that in normal tissues, which was further confirmed in clinical specimens. MEK5 knockdown markedly inhibited ccRCC cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, whereas MEK5 overexpression resulted in the opposite results. Western blotting revealed that overexpression of MEK5 could further activate the mTOR signalling pathway. Moreover, the MEK5 inhibitor BIX02189 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, induced apoptosis, and effectively inhibited cell migration and clone formation. BIX02189 also showed an excellent antitumor effect and a favourable safety profile in murine models.ConclusionsMEK5 expression was aberrantly increased in ccRCC, which activated the mTOR signalling pathway and regulated cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and clone formation in ccRCC. Targeted inhibition of MEK5 represents a promising new strategy in patients with ccRCC.",0
"Tumor organoids are biological models for studying precision medicine. Microfluidic technology offers significant benefits for high throughput drug screening using tumor organoids. However, the range of concentrations achievable with traditional linear gradient generators in microfluidics is restricted, generating logarithmic drug concentration gradients by adjusting the channel ratio in the chip is confined to single-drug dilution chips, significantly restricting the application of microfluidics in drug screening. Here, we presented a microfluidic chip featuring continuous dilution capabilities, which generates logarithmic stepwise drug concentration gradients. We have devised a “mathematical-circuit-chip” model for designing such chips, and based on this model, we have developed and fabricated a device capable of providing 36 distinct drug concentration conditions for two types of drugs. The chip is composed of two structurally identical yet orthogonally arranged layers, each containing a dilution network capable of forming a 5-fold gradient and a tumor organoid culture module. Drug and culture medium delivery to the open culture chamber array is driven by syringe pumps. We have conducted drug screening experiments on patient-derived tumor organoids. This device facilitates high-throughput drug screening for patient-derived organoids, representing a significant stride toward the realization of precision medicine.","The growing use of adjuvants in the fast-paced formulation of new vaccines has created an unprecedented need for meaningful analytical assays that deliver reliable quantitative data from complex adjuvant and adjuvant–antigen mixtures. Due to their complex chemical and physical properties, method development for the separation of vaccine adjuvants is considered a highly challenging and laborious task. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is among the most important tests in the (bio)pharmaceutical industry for release and stability indicating measurements including adjuvant content, identity, and purity profile. However, the time constraints of developing “on-demand” robust quantitative methods prior to each change in formulation can easily lead to sample analysis becoming a bottleneck in vaccine development. Herein, a simple and efficient generic analytical framework capable of chromatographically resolving the most commonly used non-aluminum-based adjuvants across academic and industrial sectors is introduced. This was designed to seek a more proactive approach for fast-paced assay development endeavors that evolved from extensive stationary phase screening in conjunction with multifactorial in silico simulations of adjuvant retention time (RT) as a function of gradient time, temperature, organic modifier blending, and buffer concentration. The multifactorial retention models yield 3D resolution maps with excellent baseline separation of all adjuvants in a single run, which was found to be very accurate, with differences between experimental and simulated retention times of less than 1%. The analytical framework described here also includes the introduction of a more versatile approach to method development by introducing a dynamic RT database for adjuvants covering the entire library of adjuvants with broad mechanisms of action across numerous vaccine formulations with excellent linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity. The power of this framework was also demonstrated with numerous analytical assays that can be generated rapidly from simulations guiding vaccine processes in the development of new adjuvant formulations. Analytical assay in this work covers content, purity profile by LC with diode array detector (DAD) and charged aerosol detector (CAD), and component identification by LC with mass spectrometry (MS) across complex vaccine formulations, including the use of surfactants (for example, polysorbates) as well as their separation from adjuvant targets.",0
"OBJECTIVEImmune checkpoint-inhibitory therapeutic antibodies have shown striking activity against several types of cancers but are less effective against brain-localized malignancies, in part due to the protective effect of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The authors hypothesized that intraarterial (IA) delivery of a novel compound, NEO100, has the potential to safely and reversibly open the BBB to enable brain-targeted therapeutic activity of checkpoint-inhibitory antibodies.METHODSImmunocompetent mice with syngeneic glioblastoma or melanoma cells implanted into their brains were subjected to a single IA injection of NEO100 to open their BBB. One dose of murine anti–PD-1/PD-L1 antibody was either coinjected with NEO100 or separately injected intravenously. Brain penetration of these antibodies and levels of CD8+ T cell infiltrate into the tumor microenvironment were quantitated and animal survival was monitored.RESULTSIA NEO100 enabled the increased accumulation of checkpoint-inhibitory antibodies in the brain, along with greater numbers of T cells. In both malignancy models, a single intervention of IA NEO100 combined with antibody resulted in the long-term survival of animals. Antibody treatment in the absence of NEO100 was far less effective.CONCLUSIONSBBB opening by IA NEO100 facilitates brain tumor access by checkpoint-inhibitory antibodies and enables their therapeutic activity, along with increased levels of T-cell recruitment.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that is capturing popular imagination and can revolutionize biomedicine. AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to break through existing barriers in oncology research and practice such as automating workflow processes, personalizing care, and reducing healthcare disparities. Emerging applications of AI/ML in the literature include screening and early detection of cancer, disease diagnosis, response prediction, prognosis, and accelerated drug discovery. Despite this excitement, only few AI/ML models have been properly validated and fewer have become regulated products for routine clinical use. In this review, we highlight the main challenges impeding AI/ML clinical translation. We present different clinical use cases from the domains of radiology, radiation oncology, immunotherapy, and drug discovery in oncology. We dissect the unique challenges and opportunities associated with each of these cases. Finally, we summarize the general requirements for successful AI/ML implementation in the clinic, highlighting specific examples and points of emphasis including the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration of stakeholders, role of domain experts in AI augmentation, transparency of AI/ML models, and the establishment of a comprehensive quality assurance program to mitigate risks of training bias and data drifts, all culminating toward safer and more beneficial AI/ML applications in oncology labs and clinics.",1
"Background:Large population-based registries, such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Registry, help in the study of rare tumors, including medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), but lack data to understand the natural history of the disease. The Medullary Thyroid Cancer Collaborative Registry (MTCCoRe) is an exhaustive multi-institutional collection of demographic, clinical, and pathological data. To determine the extent to which MTCCoRe represents the real-world MTC population, we compared the characteristics of patients enrolled in MTCCoRe with patients enrolled in population-based cancer registries.Methods:Comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics of MTC patients who were enrolled in MTCCoRe, Texas Cancer Registry (TCR), California Cancer Registry (CCR), and SEER between 1995 and 2018.Results:A total of 1416 patients were identified in MTCCoRe, 329 in TCR, 2105 in CCR, and 3820 in SEER. Percentages of patients 20–54 years in MTCCoRe were 58.0%, 50.2% in TCR, 47.2% in CCR, and 44.8% in SEER (p < 0.0001). About half of the patients were female (55.9% in MTCCoRe, 61.4% in TCR, 59% in CCR, and 57.5% in SEER (p = 0.3). Percentages of Hispanic and Black patients differed among cohorts (10.1% and 3.8% for MTCCoRe, 23.7% and 8.2% for TCR, 24.8% and 4.9% in CCR, and 15.9% and 8.2% for SEER, respectively; p < 0.001). MTCCoRe patients presented with more advanced T and N classifications than patients in the other registries (MTCCoRe, 28.6% T3-4 and 49.4% N1; TCR, 12.7% and 32.2%; CCR, 18.6% and 32.4%; and SEER, 24% and 37.8%; p < 0.0001). Prevalence of M1 disease was 10% in MTCCoRe, 11.9% in TCR, 14.1% in CCR, and 9.5% in SEER (p < 0.0001). In the MTCCoRe, 11.4% underwent systemic therapy (compared with 0.3% in TCR and 5.6% in CCR).Conclusions:The clinicodemographic profile of patients with MTC enrolled in a multi-institutional registry differs from those enrolled in population-based databases, with lower proportions of Hispanic and Black patients but additive data on treatment modalities. Moving forward, MTCCoRe and other registry and clinical trial enrollment efforts should intentionally include underrepresented groups via community engagement techniques, patient stakeholder involvement, and inclusion of languages other than English in study materials to yield more generalizable results and conclusions.","BackgroundCAR-T cell (chimeric antigen receptor T) therapy is now part of standard of care treatment of B‑cell lineage malignancies.

The median age of all patients was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 50–70) and 37% (n = 11) were female. 93% (n = 28) of patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 7% (n = 2) had multiple myeloma. The cohort was stratified whether the ICU admission was CAR‑T therapy related (that is within 30 days after CAR‑T therapy; 73%, n = 22) or the admission was of an other cause (> 30 days after CAR‑T therapy) (27%, n = 8). The median duration from CAR‑T therapy to ICU admission was 6 (range 5–8) days in CAR-T cell therapy associated ICU admissions compared with 52 (range 31–126) days in other admissions. The overall illness severity on admission was numerically higher in CAR-T-related ICU admission compared to other admissions (46 vs. 43 points, p = 0.18). Vasopressor therapy (50% vs. 75%; p = 0.19), invasive mechanical ventilation (27% vs. 50%; p = 0.24) and renal replacement therapy (14% vs. 50%; p < 0.05) were used in CAR-T-associated admission compared to other admissions, respectively. The ICU mortality (23% vs. 50%; p = 0.15) was higher in patients with other ICU admission. Median total costs of the entire inpatient stay in hospital were € 27,845 (range 8661–368,286 €) in CAR-T-associated ICU admissions compared to € 59,234 (range 23,182–127,044 €) in the group of other ICU admissions (costs of the CAR‑T product not included).ConclusionIn relation to the total costs of CAR-T-cell therapy (production of the CAR‑T product), therapy-associated complications have a relatively low impact on the costs and utilization of ICU resources.Supplementary InformationThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00063-024-01230-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"Metastatic melanoma is among the most enigmatic advanced cancers to clinically manage despite immense progress in the way of available therapeutic options and historic decreases in the melanoma mortality rate. Most patients with metastatic melanoma treated with modern targeted therapies (for example, BRAFV600E/K inhibitors) and/or immune checkpoint blockade (for example, anti-PD-1) will progress due to profound tumor cell plasticity fueled by genetic and non-genetic mechanisms, and dichotomous host microenvironmental influences. Here we discuss the determinants of tumor heterogeneity, mechanisms of therapy resistance, and effective therapy regimens that hold curative promise.","BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common leukemia with low cure rate and poor prognosis among pediatric patients. The regulation of AML immune microenvironment and methylation remains to be explored. Pediatric and adult AML patients differ significantly in epigenetic factors, and the efficiency of treatment modalities varies between the two groups of patients.MethodsWe collected mRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation data from pediatric AML patients across multiple databases. Differentially expression genes were identified, and a gene–miRNA regulatory network was constructed. Prognostic risk models were established by integrating LASSO and Cox regression, and a nomogram was generated. Based on this model, we investigated tumor-infiltrating immune cells and cell communication, analyzing the biological functions and pathways associated with prognostic factors. Furthermore, the relationships between all prognostic factors and gene modules were explored, and the impact of these factors on treatment modalities was determined.ResultsWe developed an efficient prognostic risk model and identified HOXA9, SORT1, SH3BP5, mir-224 and mir-335 as biomarkers. We validated these findings in an external dataset and observed a correlation between age and risk in pediatric patients. AML samples with lower risk scores have a better prognosis and higher expression of immune-upregulated biomarkers, and have lower immune scores. Furthermore, we detected discrepancies in immune cell infiltration and interactions between high- and low-risk group samples, which affected the efficacy of immunotherapy. We evaluated all prognostic factors and predicted the effect of immunotherapy and medicine.ConclusionThis study comprehensively investigated the role of methylation signature genes in pediatric AML at the level of genomes and transcriptomes. The research aims to enhance the risk stratification, prognosis evaluation and assessment of treatment effectiveness of AML patients. This study also highlight the uniqueness of pediatric AML and foster the development of new immunotherapy and targeted therapy strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05284-y.",0
"ABSTRACTKirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation is prognostic of poor survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS G12C mutations occur in 13% of NSCLC cases and despite the frequency of this mutation, advances in drug development against KRAS have historically been impeded due to the extremely high affinity of KRAS for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and the lack of a binding pocket on the surface of KRAS that is suitable for drug binding. Sotorasib, a first-in-class, highly selective KRAS G12C inhibitor overcomes this issue by irreversibly binding in the switch-II pocket. Sotorasib was granted accelerated FDA approval for the treatment of KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This review summarizes the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and clinical considerations of sotorasib.","ABSTRACTTreatment of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) has evolved over the last decade. According to studies, the use of targeted therapies has significantly increased the life expectancy of patients. Moreover, ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have improved clinical outcomes. In Lebanon, translating recommendations into clinical practice remains challenging. A Lebanese expert panel of oncologists was convened to describe the management paradigm and the clinical evidence supporting the optimal use of next-generation TKIs in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC and to provide an expert overview of local challenges and recommendations for optimizing the management of advanced NSCLC in Lebanese patients. The experts agreed that these recommendations should be part of a healthcare strategy to be implemented at the national level.",1
"IntroductionThe best first-line treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child–Pugh (CP) class B remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to perform a real-world analysis on a large sample of patients with unresectable HCC with CP B treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Vs Lenvatinib.MethodsThe study population included patients affected by advanced (BCLC-C) or intermediate (BCLC-B) HCC patients not suitable for locoregional therapies from both the Western and Eastern world (Italy, Germany, Republic of Korea and Japan), who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or Lenvatinib as first-line treatment. All the study population presented a CP class of B. The primary endpoint of the study was the overall survival (OS) of CP B patients treated with Lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Survival curves were estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan–Meier. The role of stratification factors was analyzed with log-rank tests. Finally, an interaction test was performed for the main baseline clinical characteristics.Results217 CP B HCC patients were enrolled in the study: 65 (30%) received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, and 152 (70%) received lenvatinib. The mOS for patients receiving Lenvatinib was 13.8 months (95% CI: 11.6–16.0), compared to 8.2 months (95% CI 6.3–10.2) for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Vs Lenvatinib: HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.0, p = 0.0050). No statistically significant differences were highlighted in terms of mPFS. The multivariate analysis confirmed that patients receiving Lenvatinib as first-line treatment have a significantly longer OS compared to patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.29–3.25, p = 0.0023). By evaluating the cohort of patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, we found that Child B patients with ECOG PS 0, or BCLC B stage or ALBI grade 1 were those who had benefited from the treatment thus showing survival outcomes no significantly different compared to those receiving Lenvatinib.ConclusionThe present study suggests for the first time a major benefit from Lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in a large cohort of patients with CP B class HCC.","The immune system requires a complex network of specialized cell types to defend against a range of threats. The specific roles and destinies of these cell types are enforced by a constellation of gene regulatory programs, which are orchestrated through lineage-specifying transcription factors. T Cell Factor 1 (TCF1) is a central transcription factor in many of these programs, guiding the development and functionality of both adaptive and innate lymphoid cells. This review highlights recent insights into the function of TCF1 in a variety of lymphoid cell subsets and its potential for translational applications in immune disorders and cancer.",0
"Local and systemic immunosuppression are prominent features of pancreatic cancer, rendering anti-tumor effector cells inactive and immunotherapeutic approaches ineffective. The spleen, an understudied point of antigen-presentation and T cell priming in humans, holds particular importance in pancreatic cancer due to its proximity to the developing tumor. As main effectors of antigen presentation, dendritic cells display antigens to lymphocytes, thereby bridging the innate and adaptive immune response. While tumor-infiltrating anti-inflammatory dendritic cells have been described, splenic dendritic cells have historically just been considered to stimulate the anti-tumor immune response. Here, we describe, for the first time, the presence of an immunosuppressive, tolerogenic IDO1+ dendritic cell subset in the spleens of pancreatic cancer patients that likely contributes to systemic immunosuppression that is associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Network analysis of scRNA seq data reveals extensive communication networks between the identified tolerogenic DC cluster and numerous immune cell populations in the spleen. Interactions with innate and adaptive immune cells suggest a broad influence on leukocyte trafficking and immune regulation within the spleen microenvironment. The identification of signaling pathways involving AHR and IDO-1, CCL19, NECTIN2, CLEC2D, and others elucidates potential mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive functions of this cell type.","AbstractBackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could “reprogram” intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells and thereby restore T-cell responses.MethodsEffects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. The immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.ResultsIntratumoral injection of RRV-IRF8 in mice bearing intracerebral SB28 glioma significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Furthermore, DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. In vivo treatment with azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor, showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME.ConclusionsOur results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation, achieving improved tumor control.",1
"ABSTRACTObjectivesTo evaluate the effects of CALM intervention on cancer-related fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QOL), and heart rate variability (HRV) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.MethodsA total of 153 NSCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to the CALM group and usual care (UC) group. Patients in the CALM group were received 6 CALM intervention sessions over a 12-week period and evaluated using CRF, QOL and HRV at baseline (T0) and after 2, 4, and 6 intervention sessions.ResultsThe CALM group showed significant differences in total CRF, behavioral/daily life CRF, emotional/affective CRF, sensory/physical CRF, cognitive CRF and QOL before and after CALM intervention sessions (F = 643.47, F = 208.34, F = 354.52, F = 285.69, F = 334.29, F = 245.77, p < 0.001). The CALM group showed significant increases in standard deviation of normal R-R interval (SDNN) and high-frequency power (HF) (z = −4.94, p < 0.001,z = −4.30, p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were observed between CRF and SDNN, HF and QOL across all participants.ConclusionsThe CALM intervention had a positive impact on overall physical and mental health, fatigue reduction, quality of life and autonomic dysfunction in NSCLC patients. Heart rate variability may serve as an observational indicator of physical and mental health.","PurposeCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common and debilitating long-term side effect of cancer and its treatment. While exercise has been shown to effectively reduce CRF, the underlying mechanisms are not fully clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of a 4-month walking exercise program on fatigue severity and to explore potential underlying physiological, behavioral, and psychological mechanisms of action.MethodsWe included 27 cancer survivors (59 ± 15 years, 37% female) with variable cancer diagnoses who were at least moderately fatigued and finished treatment between 6 and 36 months ago. This study with a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series design compared a 4-month walking intervention period with a 4-month control period. Measurements of fatigue and physiological, behavioral, and psychological factors were performed, supplemented with participants’ perceptions on how exercise influenced their fatigue.ResultsA significant and clinically relevant decrease in fatigue severity was found over time (β = − 8.1, 95% CI = − 12.1; − 4.2), but could not be attributed directly to the walking exercise intervention. Increases in muscle strength (β = − 0.07, 95% CI = − 0.12; − 0.02), physical activity (β = − 0.1, 95% CI = − 0.2; − 0.04), and sleep quality (β = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.3; 1.9), as well as decreases in muscle relaxation times (β = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.02; 0.16) and psychological distress (β = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.8; 1.3) were associated with reductions in fatigue severity. Resilience and physical well-being were perceived as most important constructs explaining the walking exercise effects on fatigue.ConclusionOur findings reveal potential physiological, behavioral, and psychological mechanisms underlying the multidimensional effects of exercise on fatigue severity.Implications for Cancer Survivors.Incorporating resistance exercise and addressing resilience and physical well-being might improve the efficacy of exercise interventions for cancer survivors.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11764-024-01537-y.",1
"Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging criteria, clinical guidelines provide tutorials to clinical management of liver cancer at their individual stages. However, most patients diagnosed with liver cancer are at advanced stage; therefore, many researchers conduct investigations on targeted therapy, aiming to improve the overall survival of these patients. To date, small-molecule-based targeted therapies are highly recommended (first line: sorafenib and lenvatinib; second line: regorafenib and cabozantinib) by current the clinical guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Herein, we summarize the small-molecule-based targeted therapies in liver cancer, including the approved and preclinical therapies as well as the therapies under clinical trials, and introduce their history of discovery, clinical trials, indications, and molecular mechanisms. For drug resistance, the revealed mechanisms of action and the combination therapies are also discussed. In fact, the known small-molecule-based therapies still have limited clinical benefits to liver cancer patients. Therefore, we analyze the current status and give our ideas for the urgent issues and future directions in this field, suggesting clues for novel techniques in liver cancer treatment.","Aim: The present investigation aimed to develop niosomes containing gold nanoparticles (Nio-AuNPs) and to evaluate the combinational effect of Nio-AuNPs and x-ray radiation therapy (XRT) on growth inhibition potential and induction of apoptosis in the A549 cell line.Materials & methods: Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized, and niosomes were prepared using the thin-film hydration method. Various techniques were employed to determine their physiochemical characteristics. MTT assay, cell apoptosis analysis and combination index analysis were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic feasibility of Nio-AuNPs combined with XRT.Results: The combination of Nio-AuNPs and XRT resulted in greater cytotoxicity compared with XRT alone or with AuNPs.Conclusion: The AuNPs-loaded niosomal formulation enhances the efficacy of XRT on lung cancer cells in vitro, presenting a promising and effective therapeutic strategy.",1
"Key Points•Combining CAR-T cells targeting CD19 & CD22 with a recombinant, polymer-conjugated IL15 receptor agonist (NKTR-255) was safe and feasible.•NKTR-255 was associated with increases in cytokines (IL15 and interferon-γ) and related chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10).","SummaryPrevention and treatment of infections are primary goals of treatment of children and adults with primary immune deficiencies due to decreased antibody production. Approaches to these goals include immunoglobulin replacement therapy, vaccination, and prophylactic treatment with antimicrobials. In this review, the infectious and non-infectious complications of antibody deficiencies will be discussed along with the limited number of studies that support the effective use of the available therapies and to drive the development of new therapies. Some illustrative case studies will be presented and the outlook for additional controlled clinical trials and potential for therapies driven by the underlying disease genetics will be considered.",0
"BackgroundThe incidence of lung cancer tends to be younger, and adenocarcinoma is the main histological type. Even patients with the same tumor type may have significant differences in clinical features, tumor microenvironment and genomic background at different ages. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, differences in ICI efficacy between older and younger patients are unknown. Our study aimed to explore the relationship between age and immunotherapy in LUAD.MethodsIn our study, 1313 resected LUAD patients in our hospital were divided into young (age ≤ 50) and old groups (age > 50), and the clinical characteristic differences between them were analyzed. Of these, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on the 311 cases. In addition, immune-related signatures of 508 LUAD patients were analyzed by TCGA RNA expression data. Then, we validated genomic and clinical information of 270 LUAD samples in the MSKCC cohort.ResultsERBB2 and EGFR gene mutations were significantly different between the two groups, and the gene mutation number in the old group was significantly higher than that in the young group. In addition, immune-related signatures of LUAD patients were analyzed by TCGA RNA expression data, which indicated that the patients in the old group might have a better immune microenvironment. Then, we validated the MSKCC cohort and found that the TMB of the old group was significantly higher than that of the young group, and the OS of immunotherapy was longer in the old group.ConclusionOur study was the first to analyze the differences in the genomic landscape and immune-related biomarkers between the young and old groups of LUAD patients and found that the old group had a better efficacy of immunotherapy, providing a reference for the study design and treatment of patients with LUAD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04195-8.","PurposeExisting biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.MethodsAn animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.ResultsWe identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes (RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and metastasis.ConclusionThe model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04495-z.",1
"Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that reside in peripheral tissues and are responsible for initiating adaptive immune responses. As gatekeepers of the immune system, DCs need to continuously explore their surroundings, for which they can rapidly move through various types of connective tissue and basement membranes. DC motility has been extensively studied on flat 2D surfaces, yet the influences of a contextual 3D fibrous environment still need to be described. Using ECM-mimicking suspended fiber networks, we show how immature DCs (iDCs) engage in migratory cycles that allow them to transition from persistent migration to slow migratory states. For a subset of iDCs with high migratory potential, we report the organization of protrusions at the front of the cell body, which reverses upon treatment with inflammation agent PGE2. We identify an unusual migratory response to aligned fiber networks, whereby iDCs use filamentous protrusions to attach laterally and exert forces on fibers to migrate independent of fiber alignment. Increasing the fiber diameter from 200 to 500 nm does not significantly affect the migratory response; however, iDCs respond by forming denser actin bundles around larger diameters. Overall, the correlation between force-coupling and random migration of iDCs in aligned fibrous topography offers new insights into how iDCs might move in fibrous environments in vivo.","IntroductionImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and has generated remarkable clinical results against multiple malignancies. Exploration of new technical approaches to further boost the therapeutic efficacy of ICB is of potential medical importance. In this study, we designed a novel nanotherapeutics for ICB immunotherapy.MethodsCTLA-4 aptamers were conjugated to the surface of albumin nanoparticle to construct an aptamer-modified nanostructure (Apt-NP). To improve ICB efficacy, fexofenadine (FEXO), an antihistamine, was encapsulated into Apt-NP to make a drug-loaded nanoparticle (Apt-NP-FEXO). The antitumor efficacies of Apt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsApt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO had average diameters of 149 nm and 159 nm, respectively. Similar to free CTLA-4 aptamers, Apt-modified NPs could selectively bind with CTLA-4 positive cells and improve lymphocyte-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity in vitro. In animal studies, compared with free CTLA-4 aptamer, Apt-NP significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Moreover, Apt-NP-FEXO further improved antitumor efficacy vs. Apt-NP in vivo.ConclusionThe results suggest that Apt-NP-FEXO represents a novel strategy to improve ICB outcome and may have application potential in cancer immunotherapy.",0
"PurposeTumor spread through air space (STAS) is a novel pattern of invasion related to poor prognosis in non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, little is known about the role of STAS in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We sought to determine whether STAS has a significant effect on recurrence among SCLC patients.MethodsWe collected clinical and follow-up information from 181 resected stage I–III SCLC patients and compared overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the patients with or without STAS using the Kaplan‒Meier method. To explore the effect of STAS on recurrence, a competing-risk analysis was conducted.ResultsAmong 181 SCLC patients, STAS was observed in 56 (30.94%) patients, and 125 (69.06%) patients did not have STAS. Furthermore, 33 (18.23%) patients had recurrence, including 12 patients with brain metastases. Patients with STAS had worse DFS. The cumulative incidence of any recurrence was higher in patients with STAS than in those without STAS. Univariate and multivariate competing-risk regression analyses revealed that sublobar resection and STAS were independent risk factors for SCLC recurrence (p = 0.009 and p = 0.029 for multivariate analysis, respectively).ConclusionSCLC patients with STAS have worse DFS than SCLC patients without STAS. STAS is an independent prognostic factor in SCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04462-8.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world and is one of the leading indications for liver transplantation, liver transplantation is the gold standard treatment for end stage liver disease. Diagnosis is based up on radiological characteristics and rarely biopsy results. However treatment must be individualized to each patient to improve recurrences and outcomes. In this article, we focus on the different selection criteria for liver transplantation. This study aimed to investigate the distribution laws and research frontiers of international literature, so as to present holistic bibliometric evaluation of the studies on 5-year survival and disease-free recurrence in 5 years, according to hepatocarcinoma criteria for liver transplantation. The paper aims to review and analyze 5-year survival and disease-free recurrence based on hepatocarcinoma criteria for liver transplantation. It systematically examines and summarizes distribution characteristics and research frontiers through bibliometric analysis. A bibliographic search was implemented in PubMed/Medline, Clinical Key, Science Direct and Index Medicus with MESH terms, from the year 1996–2022. Patients selected for transplantation using the Metroticket 2.0 (MT2) criteria had the highest overall survival along with patients selected for transplantation using the Milan Criteria had the best 5-year disease-free recurrence. The Metroticket 2.0 criteria (MT2) and Milan Criteria (MC) have shown the most favorable post-transplant outcomes for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, MC demonstrated the best 5-year disease-free recurrence rate, underscoring the significance of taking into account tumor morphology and biology when determining the eligibility of HCC patients for liver transplantation. The distribution characteristics and research frontiers by bibliometrics concerning prognostic role of selection criteria for liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma the collaborations are sufficient to reach a consensus that the Milan criteria are the best criteria.",1
"In this retrospective study, MET inhibitor therapy demonstrated better survival outcomes compared with other treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Furthermore, MET ex14 skipping mutations and/or MET amplification typically occurred in the absence of other oncogenic driver mutations. With recent approvals of METi for patients with MET ex14 NSCLC, there is a need to identify more patients for treatment with METi to improve survival outcomes.Background:We evaluated the disease and patient characteristics, treatment, and MET testing patterns, predictive biomarkers and survival outcomes in patients with MET-dysregulated metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting.Patients and Methods:This was a multinational, retrospective, noninterventional chart review study. Data from medical records of patients with advanced/metastatic EGFR wild-type, MET-dysregulated NSCLC (December 2017-September 2018) were abstracted into electronic data collection forms.Results:Overall, 211 patient charts were included in this analysis; 157 patients had MET exon 14 skipping mutations (MET ex14; with or without concomitant MET amplification) and 54 had MET amplification only. All patients were tested for MET ex14, whereas MET amplification was evaluated in 168 patients. No overlap was reported between MET dysregulation and ALK, ROS1 or RET rearrangements, or HER2 exon 20 insertions. Overall, 56 of 211 patients (26.5%) received MET inhibitor (METi) therapy in any treatment-line setting (31.2% in the MET ex14 cohort; 13% in the MET-amplified only cohort). In the MET ex14 cohort, median OS in patients receiving METi was 25.4 months versus 10.7 months in patients who did not (HR [95% CI]: 0.532 [0.340–0.832]; P = .0055). In the MET-amplified only cohort, median OS was 20.6 months in patients treated with METi compared with 7.6 months in those without METi (HR [95% CI]: 0.388 [0.152–0.991]; P = .0479).Conclusions:MET alterations in NSCLC typically occur in the absence of other oncogenic driver mutations and are associated with poor survival outcomes. Notably, METi therapies are associated with improved survival outcomes in patients with MET-dysregulated NSCLC.","BackgroundTumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute the main infiltrating immune cells in the solid tumor microenvironment. Amounting studies have analyzed the antitumor effect on immune response induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), γ-interferon (γ-IFN), and palmitic Acid (PA). However, their combined treatment for gastric cancer (GC) has not been illuminated.MethodsWe investigated the relevance of macrophage polarization and the effect of PA and γ-IFN in GC in vitro and in vivo. M1 and M2 macrophage-associated markers were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometry, and the activation level of the TLR4 signaling pathways was evaluated by western blot analysis. The effect of PA and γ-IFN on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells (GCCs) was evaluated by Cell-Counting Kit-8, transwell assays, and wound-healing assays. In vivo animal models were used to verify the effect of PA and γ-IFN on tumor progression, and the M1 and M2 macrophage markers, CD8 + T lymphocytes, regulatory T cells (Treg) cells, and the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tumor tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical (IHC).ResultsThe results showed that this combination strategy enhanced M1-like macrophages and diminished M2-like macrophages through the TLR4 signaling pathway in vitro. In addition, the combination strategy impairs the proliferative and migratory activity of GCC in vitro and in vivo. While, the antitumor effect was abolished using the TAK-424 (a specific TLR-4 signaling pathway inhibitor) in vitro.ConclusionsThe combined treatment of PA and γ-IFN inhibited GC progression by modulating macrophages polarization via the TLR4 pathway.",0
"AbstractThis review highlights the significant role of nanodrug delivery systems (NDDS) in enhancing the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Focusing on the integration of NDDS with immune regulation strategies, it explores their transformative impacts on the tumor microenvironment and immune response dynamics. Key advancements include the optimization of drug delivery through NDDS, targeting mechanisms like immune checkpoint blockade and modulating the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Despite the progress, challenges such as limited clinical efficacy and complex manufacturing processes persist. The review emphasizes the need for further research to optimize these systems, potentially revolutionizing cancer treatment by improving delivery efficiency, reducing toxicity and overcoming immune resistance.","CD8+ T cells are the primary mediators of anticancer immunity, and modulation of the CD8+ T cell response has been a central focus of immunotherapy to treat cancer. When CD8+ T cells specifically recognize antigenic peptides presented by the MHC-I on tumor cells, they become activated and kill the tumor cells. However, one pivotal mechanism through which tumor cells evade immune surveillance is to reduce their antigen presentation. To identify novel immunotherapeutic targets, we specifically focused on the role of MAL2 in immune evasion in endometrial cancer (EC) and the underlying mechanism. MAL2 was overexpressed in EC tissues and cells and its transcription was enhanced by RAD21. Knockdown of MAL2 or RAD21 inhibited malignant behavior and immune evasion of EC cells by repressing MHC-I expression and the cytotoxic effects of CD8+ cells. Conversely, MAL2 promoted immune evasion of EC cells and tumor growth in mice in the presence of RAD21 knockdown. These results indicate that RAD21 activation of MAL2 inhibits antigen processing and presentation of MHC-I, thereby inducing immune evasion of EC cells. We further suggest that RAD21 and MAL2 may serve as novel targets for EC immunotherapy.",1
"PurposeOnly a small proportion of patients obtain survival benefit from PD-1 blockade immunotherapy due to the highly heterogeneous and suppressed immune micro-environment of GBM. We aimed at revealing the characteristics of tumor micro-environment (TME) of GBM related to response to PD-1 inhibitors and constructing a response prediction model for screening patients possibly benefit from PD-1 inhibitors.MethodsBased on the composition and expression profiles of cell subpopulations calculated by deconvoluting the GBM bulk RNA-seq, differentially expressed gene analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to explore genes and pathways related to response to PD-1 inhibitors. Further by combining least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and expression correlation with PD-L1, the response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors were identified and the response prediction model was constructed through binary logistic regression.ResultsThe comparison of abundances of tumor infiltrating immune cells showed that the abundance of M0 macrophages of responders was lower, while the abundance of activated dendritic cells (DCs) was higher before PD-1 inhibitors treatment; the abundances of plasma cells and M0 macrophages of responders were lower after PD-1 inhibitors treatment. In addition, GSEA showed that the main up-regulation pathways in the tumor micro-environment of responders before PD-1 inhibitors treatment included the regulation of T-helper 1 type immune response, the positive regulation of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, p53 signaling pathway, homotypic cell–cell adhesion, etc., the main down-regulation pathways included the activation of microglia and myeloid leukocytes, Ras signaling pathway, etc. Afterward, ITGAX, LRRFIP1 and FMN1 were identified as the key response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors and the response prediction model based on them showed good predictive performance with potential value of clinical application in its validation and verification.ConclusionsITGAX, LRRFIP1 and FMN1 were identified as the response prediction genes of PD-1 inhibitors and the response prediction model based on them was proved to have potential clinical value.","Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic cell death mechanism characterized by iron-dependent membrane lipid peroxidation. Here, we review what is known about the cellular mechanisms mediating the execution and regulation of ferroptosis. We first consider how the accumulation of membrane lipid peroxides leads to the execution of ferroptosis by altering ion transport across the plasma membrane. We then discuss how metabolites and enzymes that are distributed in different compartments and organelles throughout the cell can regulate sensitivity to ferroptosis by impinging upon iron, lipid and redox metabolism. Indeed, metabolic pathways that reside in the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets, peroxisomes and other organelles all contribute to the regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity. We note how the regulation of ferroptosis sensitivity by these different organelles and pathways seems to vary between different cells and death-inducing conditions. We also highlight transcriptional master regulators that integrate the functions of different pathways and organelles to modulate ferroptosis sensitivity globally. Throughout this Review, we highlight open questions and areas in which progress is needed to better understand the cell biology of ferroptosis.",0

Various techniques were employed to determine their physiochemical characteristics. MTT assay, cell apoptosis analysis and combination index analysis were conducted to evaluate the therapeutic feasibility of Nio-AuNPs combined with XRT.Results: The combination of Nio-AuNPs and XRT resulted in greater cytotoxicity compared with XRT alone or with AuNPs.Conclusion: The AuNPs-loaded niosomal formulation enhances the efficacy of XRT on lung cancer cells in vitro, presenting a promising and effective therapeutic strategy.","AbstractCD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy represents an effective approach to treating patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. Nevertheless, owing to the immunosuppressive effects of this regimen, patients undergoing CD19 CAR-T cell therapy may face an elevated risk of invasive fungal infections, which involve fungi penetrating the host’s tissues or bloodstream, leading to life-threating infectious diseases. Herein, we present the case of a 17-year-old male diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who subsequently experienced a fatal invasive fungal infection following administration of CAR-T cell therapy. Furthermore, we delve into the identification of risk factors, implementation of preventive measures and exploration of therapeutic interventions for invasive fungal infections after CAR-T cell therapy.",0
"ABSTRACTEnhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, plays a crucial role in tumor progression by regulating gene expression. EZH2 inhibitors have emerged as promising anti-tumor agents due to their potential in cancer treatment strategies. However, single-target inhibitors often face limitations such as drug resistance and side effects. Dual-target inhibitors, exemplified by EZH1/2 inhibitor HH-2853, offer enhanced efficacy and reduced adverse effects. This review highlights recent advancements in dual inhibitors targeting EZH2 and other proteins like BRD4, PARP1, and EHMT2, emphasizing rational design, structure–activity relationships, and safety profiles, suggesting their potential in clinical applications.","AbstractGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor with a median survival rate of 14 months. Despite the success of immunotherapy in treating various cancer types, its efficacy remains poor in GBM. Such limitation can be attributed to the profound immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of GBM enriched with the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Quaking (Qki) is an RNA-binding protein that is mutated or deleted in more than 35% of GBM patients. Decreased levels of Qki in TAMs associates with worsened survival rates and responsiveness to immunotherapy in GBM mouse and patients. Moreover, Qki is a tumor suppressor gene in GBM and a major regulator in phagocytosis, a fundamental biological process in delivering antigens to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II). MHC II-restricted antigen presentation in macrophages of GBM is important in maintaining the fitness of cytotoxic and helper T cells required in anti-tumor response. However, the mechanism through which Qki regulates MHCII expression and presentation has yet to be elucidated. I hypothesize that Qki promotes MHC II expression in TAMs, thereby constraining the development and progression of GBM. In vitro assays like immunofluorescent staining, qRT-PCR, cell co-culture system, and flow cytometry will be performed involving QPP (Qk-/-Trp53-/-; Pten-/-) mouse brains, QPP cells, and mouse macrophage cell lines. A positive correlation between transcriptomic and protein expression levels of Qki, MHC II, and CIITA (a master regulator of MHC II) was confirmed in both mouse QPP and human GBM samples. Moreover, bone-marrow-derived macrophages activated by QPP cell supernatant shows upregulated levels of Qki and thus MHC II genes. A preliminary conclusion is that Qki plays a permissive role in MHCII expression in TAMs of GBM. Further downstream impact of Qki in TAMs will be evaluated in T cell activity and in transcription of MHC II in TAMs.",0
"Introduction:ERBB2 or HER2 alterations are found in approximately 2% to 5% of NSCLCs; most are exon 20 insertion mutations. The efficacy and safety of poziotinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, were assessed in patients with treatment-naive NSCLC whose tumors harbor HER2 exon 20 insertions.Methods:ZENITH20 is an open-label, multicohort, multicenter, global, phase 2 trial. ZENITH20-C4 enrolled treatment-naive patients with NSCLC with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 insertions. Poziotinib was administered 16 mg once daily (QD) or 8 mg twice daily (BID). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review. Secondary and exploratory end points included disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety.Results:A total of 80 patients (16 mg QD, n = 47; 8 mg BID, n = 33) were treated in ZENITH20-C4. ORR was 39% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28%–50%; 31 of 80), with a disease control rate of 73% (95% CI: 61%–82%; 58 of 80); 80% of the patients experienced tumor reduction. Median duration of response was 5.7 (95% CI: 4.6–11.9) months, and median progression-free survival was 5.6 (95% CI: 5.4–7.3) months. The most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were rash (QD, 45%; BID, 39%), stomatitis (QD, 21%; BID, 15%), and diarrhea (QD, 15%; BID, 21%). Among all subtypes of HER2 exon 20 insertions, seven patients (9%) harboring tumors with G778_P780dupGSP had the best clinical outcomes (ORR, 71%).Conclusions:Poziotinib was found to have clinically meaningful efficacy with a manageable toxicity profile for patients with treatment-naive NSCLC harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations.","PurposeThis study aimed to compare ramucirumab-paclitaxel versus chemotherapy in second-line (2L) advanced gastroesophageal cancer (aGEC) based on HER2 status and analyze prognostic factors.MethodsThe study includes patients from the AGAMENON-SEOM registry with aGEC and known HER2 status who received 2L between 2016 and 2021. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and multivariable Cox regression analysis was done to adjust for confounding variables.ResultsOf the 552 patients who met the selection criteria, 149 (26.9%) had HER2-positive aGEC, 89 were treated with chemotherapy, and 60 with ramucirumab-paclitaxel, and 403 had an HER2-negative aGEC, 259 were treated with chemotherapy, and 144 with ramucirumab-paclitaxel.In the whole sample, 2L PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.8–3.2), 2L OS, 5.7 months (5.2–6.3), and ramucirumab-paclitaxel versus chemotherapy was associated with increased PFS (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53–0.78, p < 0.0001) and OS (HR 0.68, 0.55–0.83, p = 0.0002). Median PFS of ramucirumab- paclitaxel versus chemotherapy was 3.5 vs 2.8 months (HR 0.67, 0.54–0.83, p = 0.0004) in HER2-negative, and 4.7 vs 2.7 months (HR 0.57, 0.40–0.82, p = 0.0031) in HER2-positive aGEC, respectively. Median OS for ramucirumab-paclitaxel versus chemotherapy was 6.6 vs 5 months (HR 0.67, 0.53–0.85, p = 0.0007) in HER2-negative, and 7.4 vs 5.6 months (HR 0.70, 0.53–1.04, p = 0.083) in HER2-positive aGEC, respectively. ECOG-PS, tumor burden, Lauren subtype, and neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio were prognostic factors.ConclusionsIn patients with an aGEC from the AGAMENON-SEOM registry, 2L treatment with ramucirumab-paclitaxel was superior to chemotherapy in PFS, OS and response rate, independent of HER2 status.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04294-6.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown limited success in patients with solid tumors. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have shown that adrenoceptor beta-2 (ADRB2) is a novel checkpoint receptor that inhibits T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. To inhibit ADRB2-mediated inhibitory signaling, we downregulated ADRB2 in CAR-T (shβ2-CAR-T) cells via RNA interference, assessed different parameters, and compared them with conventional second-generation CAR-T cells. ADRB2 knockdown CAR-T cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, by increasing CD69, CD107a, GzmB, IFN-γ, T-bet, and GLUT-1. In addition, ADRB2 deficiency led to improved proliferation, increased CD8/CD4 T cell ratio, and decreased apoptosis in CAR-T cells. shβ2-CAR-T cells expressed more Bcl-2 and led to the generation of more significant proportions of T central memory cells. Finally, the ZAP-70/NF-κB signaling axis was shown to be responsible for the improved functions of novel CAR-T cells. In tumor-bearing mice, shβ2-CAR-T cells performed better than conventional CAR-T cells in eradicating prostate tumors. The study provides the basis for future clinical and translational CAR-T cell research to focus on adrenergic stress-mediated challenges in the tumor microenvironment of stressed tumors.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy is making rapid strides owing to its wide range of therapeutic applications. However, development of serious immune responses to the capsid antigen or the therapeutic transgene product hinders its full clinical impact. Immune suppressive (IS) drug treatments have been used in various clinical trials to prevent the deleterious effects of cytotoxic T cells to the viral vector or transgene, although there is no consensus on the best treatment regimen, dosage, or schedule. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial for maintaining tolerance against self or nonself antigens. Of importance, Tregs also play an important role in dampening immune responses to AAV gene therapy, including tolerance induction to the transgene product. Approaches to harness the tolerogenic effect of Tregs include the use of selective IS drugs that expand existing Tregs, and skew activated conventional T cells into antigen-specific peripherally induced Tregs. In addition, Tregs can be expanded ex vivo and delivered as cellular therapy. Furthermore, receptor engineering can be used to increase the potency and specificity of Tregs allowing for suppression at lower doses and reducing the risk of disrupting protective immunity. Because immune-mediated toxicities to AAV vectors are a concern in the clinic, strategies that can enhance or preserve Treg function should be considered to improve both the safety and efficacy of AAV gene therapy.",1
"AbstractBackgroundSarcomatoid carcinomas (SC) are rare tumors with both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, linked to aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Sarcomatoid carcinoma of unknown primary (SCUP) is an exceedingly rare subset with limited literature and no standardized management guidelines. This study aims to characterize the clinical presentations, treatment patterns, and genomic landscape of SCUP.Patients and MethodsData were retrospectively collected from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cancer of Unknown Primary Registry. Patients included had biopsy-proven SC with no identifiable primary tumor despite comprehensive diagnostic evaluations. Baseline characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) results, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Kaplan–Meier survival estimates, and Cox proportional hazards regression.ResultsFifty-two SCUP patients were identified, with a median age of 60 years. Most patients presented with widely metastatic disease, particularly lytic bone lesions. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was noted in nearly half of the patients. IHC showed high positivity for AE1/AE3 and OSCAR antibodies. Tumor NGS revealed 247 alterations, with TP53 being the most common mutation. Patients receiving definitive therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 72 months, significantly longer than those receiving systemic therapy (14 months). Immunotherapy was a significant prognostic factor, reducing the risk of death by 90%.ConclusionsThis study provides essential insights into the clinical and genomic characteristics of SCUP, advocating for the integration of definitive therapy and immunotherapy in treatment protocols. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and improve patient outcomes.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is one of the first-line clinical therapeutic strategies for HCC. Still, the effectiveness of chemotherapy is hampered by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and drug resistance caused by insufficient delivery. Herein, we developed a metal-drug self-delivery nanomedicine (FDAH) to improve the chemo/chemodynamic therapeutic efficacy of HCC. The core of FDAH is an iron-based nanoparticle chelated with two clinical drugs, Doxorubicin (DOX) and Plerixafor (AMD3100). Additionally, the nanomedicine is externally modified with a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell, which can prolong the circulation time of the nanoparticles in the bloodstream after intravenous administration. After entering the bloodstream, the nanomedicine reaches the tumor tissue through the EPR effect and is phagocytosed by the tumor cells via HA/CD44-specific interaction. Iron ion-mediated chemodynamic therapy is mediated by the Fenton reaction to generate ROS, causing an imbalance of redox homeostasis within the tumor cells and enhancing the sensitivity of tumor cells to DOX. In addition, AMD3100 intervenes in the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to influence the infiltration level of immune cells and promote DOX chemotherapy in tumor cells. This work suggests that alleviating immunosuppression via a metal-drug self-delivery system of the CXCR4 inhibitor can effectively improve the DOX chemotherapy and iron ions-mediated chemodynamic therapy.",0
"BackgroundDisulfidptosis, as a new mode of programmed cell death, is closely associated with tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, M2 tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) plays an important role in tumor progression. Here, we propose to combine these two perspectives to detect novel disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related biomarkers in bladder cancer (BCa) to identify various tumor subtypes, construct prognostic features, reveal immune and somatic mutational landscapes, and screen for drugs in BCa.MethodsWe used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to mine M2 TAM-related genes. Consensus unsupervised clustering was performed to identify potential tumor subtypes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to build the risk model. We then explored the immune cell, immune function, immune checkpoint expression patterns and somatic mutational landscape in clusters and risk groups. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis for anti-cancer drugs.ResultsWe identified 3057 M2 TAM-related genes and intersected them with disulfidptosis-related genes to obtain 95 disulfidptosis and M2 TAM-related genes (DMRGs). In terms of tumor subtypes, two molecular clusters were identified. Cluster 1 showed stronger immunogenicity and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). We also predicted 50 drugs with high sensitivity in cluster 1. On the basis of risk grouping, the high-risk group had poor overall survival in the training, test, and validation groups. Ten screened anti-cancer drugs were more sensitive in the high-risk group. A nomogram predicting survival of BCa patients was also established.ConclusionBy combining two hotspot perspectives, disulfidptosis and M2 TAM, we provide a valuable risk score signature for establishing individualized treatment regimens and drug choices. The risk score may serve as an independent risk factor for BCa patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05352-3.","Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a groundbreaking method of treating malignancies.

In this review, we focus on the effects of A. muciniphila on the human immune system and the positive impacts of A. muciniphila on cancer immunotherapy, which can build on strengths and improve weaknesses of cancer immunotherapy. The potential clinical applications of A. muciniphila on cancer immunotherapy are also proposed, which have great prospects for anti-tumor therapy.",0
"AbstractIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas, comprising both astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, represent a distinct group of tumors that pose an interdisciplinary challenge. Addressing the needs of affected patients requires close collaboration among various disciplines, including neuropathology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery, radiation oncology, neurology, medical oncology, and other relevant specialties when necessary. Interdisciplinary tumor boards are central in determining the ideal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these patients. The key tasks of a tumor board include the evaluation of imaging findings, selecting the appropriate surgical approach, discussing additional treatment options, and identification/determination of tumor recurrence and progression. In addition to established treatments such as radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy, patients with an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant glioma for whom additional treatment is indicated may now also have the option of receiving treatment with an mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitor such as vorasidenib or ivosidenib. In this regard, the collaborative nature of tumor boards becomes even more crucial for evaluating comprehensively the needs of these patients. Through interdisciplinary discussions, tumor boards aim to develop personalized treatment strategies that maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing potential side effects and preserving patients’ quality of life.","AbstractThe clinical efficacy of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors in the treatment of patients with grade 2 IDH-mutant (mIDH) gliomas is a significant therapeutic advancement in neuro-oncology. It expands treatment options beyond traditional radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, which may lead to significant long-term neurotoxic effects while extending patient survival. The INDIGO study demonstrated that vorasidenib, a pan-mIDH inhibitor, improved progression-free survival for patients with grade 2 mIDH gliomas following surgical resection or biopsy compared to placebo and was well tolerated. However, these encouraging results leave a wake of unanswered questions: Will higher-grade mIDH glioma patients benefit? When is the appropriate timing to start and stop treatment? Where does this new treatment option fit in with other treatment modalities? In this study, we review the limited data available to start addressing these questions, provide a framework of how to discuss these gaps with current patients, and highlight what is needed from the neuro-oncology community for more definitive answers.",1
"ObjectivesThis study aimed to compare the efficacy of local excision (LE) and intersphincteric resection (ISR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieved a significant or complete pathological response following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients with stage ypT0-1ycN0 low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy who underwent LE or ISR between June 2016 and June 2021. Baseline characteristics, short-term outcomes, long-term oncological outcomes, and functional outcomes, were compared between the two groups. To reduce the selection bias, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was performed.ResultsThis study included 106 patients (LE group: n = 51, ISR group: n = 55). There were significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups (P < 0.05). After IPTW, there were almost no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. The LE group showed less postoperative complications and better function outcomes compared to the ISR group. The LE group had significantly lower rates of complications (13.7% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.014). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of long-term oncological outcomes.ConclusionsFor patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer achieving significant or complete pathological response after neoadjuvant therapy, both LE and ISR present comparable oncological outcomes. Yet, LE seems to show more advantages in terms of postoperative complications and functional outcomes. These findings offer important insights for surgical decision-making, emphasizing the necessity to consider both oncological and functional outcomes in selecting the optimal surgical approach.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05454-y.","Immunotherapy has revolutionized the systemic treatment of solid tumors, including advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC), providing durable responses with a favorable safety profile. Multiple immune checkpoint inhibitor agents have been approved in monotherapy in second-line setting, and for a selected group of chemo-naïve cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression. Despite the incorporation of immunotherapy to the systemic treatment landscape of aUC, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in frontline setting for vast majority of patients. Urothelial carcinoma is a chemosensitive disease with response rates of up to 50% to frontline chemotherapy. However, the response to chemotherapy is short lasting with vast majority of patients experiencing disease progression and death within months. In this context, maintenance therapy constitutes an attractive therapeutic strategy to maximize the time to treatment failure. Different cytotoxic and targeted agents have been investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC but have not shown an impact on survival. Avelumab has become the first and only drug to improve overall survival as maintenance therapy after frontline platinum-based therapy in aUC patients and the first drug to be approved in this setting. This article will review the rational for maintenance therapy, the different drugs investigated as maintenance therapy for aUC, and the impact of avelumab maintenance therapy as a new standard of care in the management of aUC.",0
"Background:Routine vaccination coverage for adolescents living in the rural US is lower than adolescents living in urban areas. We sought to measure the effect of Boot Camp Translation (BCT), a community-based participatory intervention, on rural adolescent vaccination coverage.Methods:A cluster randomized controlled trial was performed September 2018-November 2021 involving 16 rural Colorado counties. Intervention county community members engaged in BCT to develop interventions to improve adolescent vaccination locally. Adolescent vaccination coverage was measured using the Colorado Immunization Information System.Results:For 11-12-year-olds, HPV initiation, HPV up-to-date, MenACWY, and Tdap vaccination coverage was lower post- versus pre-intervention in the control and intervention groups. For 11-12-year-olds in the intervention group, there was no significant difference post- versus pre-intervention in the odds of HPV vaccine initiation (adjusted ratio of odds ratios [aROR] = 0.93, 95 %: 0.85–1.02, p = 0.10) or up-to-date HPV vaccination (aROR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 0.98–1.23, p = 0.11) compared with the control group. Among 11-12-year-olds, the decrease in the proportion vaccinated with MenACWY and Tdap in the intervention group was significantly greater than the control group. Among 13-17-year-olds, there were significant increases in HPV initiation, HPV up-to-date, MenACWY, and Tdap vaccination coverage from pre- to post-intervention for both groups, with no significant differences between groups.Conclusion:11-12-year-old vaccination coverage decreased slightly from pre- to post-intervention while 13-17-year-old vaccination coverage increased. We saw no effect from the BCT intervention. Our findings about the effectiveness of BCT for improving vaccine uptake may not be generalizable because the study coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic.Clinical Trial Registry:This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03955757.","Background and purposeThe intricate mechanisms underlying intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment remain largely elusive. Recently, attention has shifted towards exploring the intercellular signaling mediated by exosomal long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) within this context.

"ABSTRACTAdoptive cell therapy (ACT) is on the horizon as a thrilling therapeutic plan for cancer. However, widespread application of ACT is often restricted by several challenges, including complexity of priming tumor-specific T cells and poor trafficking in solid tumors. The convergence of nanotechnology and cancer immunotherapy is coming of age and could address the limitations of ACT. Recent studies have provided evidence on the application of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to generate smart immune cells and to bypass problems associated with conventional ACT. Herein, we review current progress in the application of MNPs to improve preparing, guiding and tracking immune cells in cancer ACT. Besides, we comment on the challenges ahead and strategies to optimize MNPs for clinical settings.","Nanotechnology advancements have resulted in many sensors and devices for biomedical applications. Among the various nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), due to their size, shape, biocompatibility, and unique plasmonic property, are an excellent candidate for many biomedical applications. AuNPs, known for their easy surface modifications, robust nature, and photothermal activities, find application in drug delivery and cancer treatment studies. In this review, we are highlighting the recent trends in using AuNPs as nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy not only eliminates the primary tumors but also allows for the treatment of metastasis along with the recurrence of the tumor. AuNPs possess tissue-specific delivery functions that depend on the tunability in size and surface functionalization of AuNPs. AuNPs can be used to activate the tumor’s immune defense ability, or they can be used to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the interaction of the tumor environment and nanobiomedicine is very important. In the present review, we give an idea of the mode of action of AuNPs and various combinations of therapies for cancer immunotherapy.",1
"BackgroundAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a highly prevalent form of age-related dementia. However, the underlying mechanisms of AD are largely unexplored.Materials and MethodsIn this study, bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify the possible therapeutic targets for AD. The GEO database was used to screen the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs). Enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network, and LASSO model analyses were successfully performed. Furthermore, an ELISA assay was also conducted to determine the expression of principal genes within the AD and control samples.ResultsA total of 416 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were recognized based on the GSE48350 and GSE28146 datasets. The IL-1β and CXCR4 levels were markedly elevated in the AD samples relative to the control.ConclusionThe IL-1β and CXCR4 genes were identified as principal AD-related genes that can be targeted for anti-AD therapy.","BackgroundSepsis is a frequent cause of Acute Lung Injury (ALI), characterized by immune dysregulation and a high mortality rate. The role of cuproptosis, a recently discovered cell death mechanism, in sepsis-associated ALI is still unclear. The study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms and immune characteristics associated with cuproptosis in sepsis-associated ALI, with implications for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.MethodsData from the GEO database was utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in sepsis-associated ALI. Gene enrichment analysis, WGCNA, CIBERSORT algorithm, and consensus clustering were employed to investigate the associations between CRGs and immune cells. A predictive model for sepsis-associated ALI was developed based on key CRGs, and its diagnostic accuracy was assessed. Finally, qPCR was employed to validate alterations in the expression of CRGs in the sepsis-associated ALI cellular model.ResultsA total of 14 CRGs were identified in sepsis-associated ALI. Strong correlations between the CRGs and immune cells were observed, and two different CRG subtypes were identified. The expression of immune-related factors in both the CRG and gene clusters exhibited similarities, suggesting a connection between the subgroups and immune cells. The prediction model effectively forecasted the incidence of sepsis-associated ALI based on the expression of CRGs. Finally, qPCR analysis confirmed that the expressions of CRGs in the sepsis-associated ALI cell model closely matched those identified through bioinformatic analyses.ConclusionThe study comprehensively evaluated the complex relationship between cuproptosis and sepsis-associated ALI. CRGs were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence, immune characteristics, and biological processes of sepsis-associated ALI. These findings provide valuable new insights into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-associated ALI.",1
"AbstractBackgroundEarly‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in adults is commonly treated with combined modality treatment of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The role of radiotherapy has been questioned due to potential long‐term adverse effects.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.Search methodsWe updated all previous searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, MEDLINE and Embase, in trial registries and in relevant conference proceedings until November 2023.Selection criteriaWe included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and excluded trials with more than 20% of participants with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. We considered immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy eligible if both were applied similarly in the comparator groups, but did not identify such trials. For our comparisons, we separated RCTs with the same number of chemotherapy cycles in both arms and RCTs with a different number of cycles, when the chemotherapy regimens were the same. We separated RCTs which compared participants with a favourable, mixed or unfavourable risk profile.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of included trials. A third review author resolved discrepancies. We analysed time‐to‐event outcomes (overall survival, progression‐free survival) as hazard ratios (HR) and binary outcomes (adverse events) as risk ratios (RR). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.Main resultsWe included nine comparisons of eight RCTs involving 3840 participants in this updated review.Same number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseFor overall survival in individuals with favourable Hodgkin's lymphoma, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 7.92; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). Additional radiotherapy to chemotherapy is likely to improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.01 to 74.24; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and substantial imprecision) and suggests little to no difference in cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.16; 1 RCT, 667 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality or infertility.Mixed populationFor a population of mixed risk profile, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.80; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). It indicates that additional radiotherapy may lead to an improvement in progression‐free survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 10.87; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) and second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) (both very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but suggests that additional radiotherapy may increase cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.92; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with unfavourable disease, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.44; 2 RCTs, 688 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but additional radiotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.60; 1 RCT, 651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to imprecision). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.12 to 65.74; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality, second‐cancer related mortality or infertility.Different number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseThe evidence for overall survival in individuals with favourable disease treated with different numbers of chemotherapy cycles in both arms is uncertain and inclusive (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.38; 1 RCT, 357 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), yet it suggests a likely improvement in progression‐free survival with additional radiotherapy (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 RCT, 357 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). For second‐cancer‐related mortality, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.34; 1 RCT, 465 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality and infertility and data for cardiac disease‐related mortality were not estimable (no events in either group).Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with an unfavourable risk profile, additional radiotherapy may decrease overall survival slightly (HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.90; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision), but may slightly improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 6.90, 95% CI 0.36 to 132.34; 1 RCT, 276 participants), second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.77 to 6.19; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) and cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 8.22; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) (all very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Authors' conclusionsThe chemotherapy regimens in the trials differed and data for regimens commonly used today were limited. Additional radiotherapy may slightly improve progression‐free survival. The available data for overall survival and adverse events were of low and very low certainty, and we were unable to draw conclusions about the effects of additional radiotherapy on these outcomes. No studies evaluated infertility. High‐quality, longer‐term follow‐up data are required and data on fertility are needed.","AbstractBackgroundLung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).Main resultsWe included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency.People aged 65 years and olderThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusiveThe addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).People aged 75 years and olderThere may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet.Authors' conclusionsCompared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years.",1
"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia among the elderly, affects numerous individuals worldwide. Despite advances in understanding the molecular underpinnings of AD pathology, effective treatments to prevent or cure the disease remain elusive. AD is characterized not only by pathological hallmarks such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also by impairments in synaptic physiology, circuit activity and cognitive function. Synaptic homeostatic plasticity plays a vital role in maintaining the stability of synaptic and neural functions amid genetic and environmental disturbances. A key component of this regulation is presynaptic homeostatic potentiation, where increased presynaptic neurotransmitter release compensates for reduced postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, thereby stabilizing neuronal excitability. The role of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity in synapse stabilization in AD, however, remains unclear. Moreover, recent advances in transcriptomics have illuminated the complex roles of glial cells in regulating synaptic function in ageing brains and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the impact of AD-related abnormalities in glial signalling on synaptic homeostatic plasticity has not been fully delineated. This review discusses recent findings on how glial dysregulation in AD affects presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. There is increasing evidence that disrupted glial signalling, particularly through aberrant histone acetylation and transcriptomic changes in glia, compromises this plasticity in AD. Notably, the sphingosine signalling pathway has been identified as being protective in stabilizing synaptic physiology through epigenetic and homeostatic mechanisms, presenting potential therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative disorders.","AimTo describe a 10-year follow-up of children (<16y) with acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) from a UK-wide prospective surveillance study.MethodDiagnoses were retrieved from the patients’ records via the patients’ paediatric or adult neurologist using a questionnaire. Demyelinating phenotypes at follow-up were classified by an expert review panel.ResultsTwenty-four out of 125 (19.2%) children (64 males, 61 females; median age 10y, range 1y 4mo–15y 11mo), identified in the original study, were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (incidence of 2.04/million children/year); 23 of 24 fulfilled 2017 McDonald criteria at onset. Aquaporin-4-antibody neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders were diagnosed in three (2.4%, 0.26/million children/year), and relapsing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease in five (4%, 0.43/million children/year). Three out of 125 seronegative patients relapsed and 85 of 125 (68%) remained monophasic over 10 years. Five of 125 patients (4%) originally diagnosed with ADS were reclassified during follow-up: three children diagnosed initially with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were subsequently diagnosed with acute necrotising encephalopathy (RAN-binding protein 2 mutation), primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (Munc 13-4 gene inversion), and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. One child initially diagnosed with optic neuritis was later diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency, and one presenting with transverse myelitis was subsequently diagnosed with Sjögren syndrome.InterpretationThe majority of ADS presentations in children are monophasic, even at 10-year follow-up. Given the implications for treatment strategies, multiple sclerosis and central nervous system autoantibody mimics warrant extensive investigation.",0
"Efferocytosis, the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses and effectively prevents secondary necrosis. However, the mechanisms underlying efferocytosis in acute pancreatitis (AP) remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of efferocytosis in injured human and mouse pancreatic tissues. We also observed significant upregulation of CD47, an efferocytosis-related the ""do not eat me"" molecule in injured acinar cells. Subsequently, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, anti-adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene modification, and anti-CD47 antibody to investigate the potential therapeutic role of AP. CD47 expression was negatively regulated by upstream miR133a, which is controlled by the transcription factor TRIM28. To further investigate the regulation of efferocytosis and reduction of pancreatic necrosis in AP, we used miR-133a-agomir and pancreas-specific AAV-shTRIM28 to modulate CD47 expression. Our findings confirmed that CD47-mediated efferocytosis is critical for preventing pancreatic necrosis and suggest that targeting the TRIM28-miR133a-CD47 axis is clinically relevant for the treatment of AP.","Immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) can induce life-threatening immune-related adverse events, including myocarditis and myositis, which are rare but often concurrent. The molecular pathways and immune subsets underlying these toxicities remain poorly understood. To address this need, we obtained heart and skeletal muscle biopsies for single-cell RNA sequencing in living patients with cancers treated with ICTs admitted to the hospital with myocarditis and/or myositis (overlapping myocarditis plus myositis, n=10; myocarditis-only, n=1) compared to ICT-exposed patients ruled out for toxicity utilized as controls (n=9) within 96 hours of clinical presentation. Analyses of 58,523 cells revealed CD8+ T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype expressing activation/exhaustion markers in both myocarditis and myositis. Furthermore, the analyses identified a population of myeloid cells expressing tissue-resident signatures and FcγRIIIa (CD16a), which is known to bind IgG and regulate complement activation. Immunohistochemistry of affected cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues revealed protein expression of pan-IgG and complement product C4d that were associated with the presence of high-titer serum autoantibodies against muscle antigens in a subset of patients. We further identified a population of inflammatory IL-1B+TNF+ myeloid cells specifically enriched in myocarditis and associated with greater toxicity severity and poorer clinical outcomes. These results are the first to recognize these myeloid subsets in human immune-related myocarditis and myositis tissues and nominate new targets for investigation into rational treatments to overcome these high-mortality toxicities.",1
"BackgroundCirrhosis is a serious condition characterized by the replacement of healthy liver tissue with scar tissue, which can progress to liver failure if left untreated. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a concerning complication of cirrhosis. It can be challenge to identify individuals with cirrhosis who are at high risk of developing HCC, particularly in the absence of known risk factors.MethodsIn this study, statistical and bioinformatics methods were utilized to construct a protein–protein interaction network and identify disease-related hub genes. We analyzed two hub genes, CXCL8 and CCNB1, and developed a mathematical model to predict the likelihood of developing HCC in individuals with cirrhosis. We also investigated immune cell infiltration, functional analysis under ontology terms, pathway analysis, distinct clusters of cells, and protein–drug interactions.ResultsThe results indicated that CXCL8 and CCNB1 were associated with the development of cirrhosis-induced HCC. A prognostic model based on these two genes was able to predict the occurrence and survival time of HCC. In addition, the candidate drugs were also discovered based on our model.ConclusionThe findings offer the potential for earlier detection of cirrhosis-induced HCC and provide a new instrument for clinical diagnosis, prognostication, and the development of immunological medications. This study also identified distinct clusters of cells in HCC patients using UMAP plot analysis and analyzed the expression of CXCL8 and CCNB1 within these cells, indicating potential therapeutic opportunities for targeted drug therapies to benefit HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05004-6.","BackgroundThe High Mobility Group Nucleosomal Binding Domain 1 Gene (HMGN1) is crucial for epigenetic regulation. However, the specific function of HMGN1 in cancer development is unclear.MethodsRaw data on HMGN1 expression were procured from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), the University of Alabama- Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thereafter, the pan-cancer analysis was implemented to understand the HMGN1 expression patterns, prognostic value, and immunological features. Furthermore, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was executed via R language. In addition, the relationship between HMGN1 and the sensitivity of antitumor drugs was also determined. Finally, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were carried out.ResultsPan-cancer analysis revealed that HMGN1 was upregulated in several solid tumors and was associated with pathological staging and poor prognosis. In addition, HMGN1 was found to be involved in regulating the tumor microenvironment. The GSEA enrichment analysis indicated that HMGN1 assisted in the regulation of oncogenic processes, especially metabolic and immune pathways. Furthermore, HMGN1 expression was linked to microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) across diverse tumor types. RT-PCR assays indicated that HMGN1 was overexpressed in the gastric and breast cancer cell lines and tissues.ConclusionThis study highlighted the potential of HMGN1 as a biomarker for pan-cancer analysis.",0
"Introduction: Pancreatic cancer, which results from the uncontrolled growth of pancreatic cells, is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. About 90% of instances of pancreatic cancer are pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and occasionally ""pancreatic cancer"" is used exclusively to describe this subtype. Nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and FOLFIRINOX are examples of modern chemotherapeutic drugs that have the ability to quickly confer resistance in pancreatic tumor cells. Therefore, in order to treat this dreadful condition, it is essential to develop more effective medicines. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) causes pancreatic cancer cells to die apoptotically. In eukaryotes, UPS is an essential mechanism for protein breakdown. Pancreatic cancer cells are more susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress) and apoptosis when treated with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that is the first in this group of drugs approved for the treatment of cancer, especially multiple myeloma. Methods: Searching through PubMed and Google Scholar and gathering data.Results: UPS is still a popular target for pancreatic cancer treatment among researchers. However, despite the favorable results of UPS-based therapies in vitro and in vivo, the clinical results are not as promising as expected.Conclusion: A deep understanding of it, is essential to achieving the maximum results. In this review, we aim to look into the UPS along with searching for the novelist therapies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma based on manipulating it.","Introduction:Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is an appealing target to evaluate immune response in cancer immunotherapy as it is a hallmark of an active immune system. Imaging and detection via immunopositron emission tomography (immunoPET) of this soluble cytokine has been made feasible using a 89Zr-labeled (t 1/2 ~ 3.27 d) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Because of its size, using a full-length mAb as an imaging vector is not ideal for repeat serial imaging because of its prolonged blood pool residency and tumor accumulation resulting in lengthier wait times between administration and imaging. This consequently impacts the potential to image a dynamic immune response in real time. This work compares 89Zr-labeled diabodies (Db) designed with variable linker lengths between the VH and VL regions with the goal of selecting a lead Db for future studies.Methods and results:Four Db fragments with various linker lengths (HL-n, n = 7–13 amino acids) were each conjugated to desferrioxamine (DFO). The number of attached chelates was analyzed via mass spectrometry with all immunoconjugates exhibiting one unit of DFO attached. Db-DFO conjugates were subsequently radiolabeled with zirconium-89. All constructs radiolabeled with high yields. Each radioimmunoconjugate was tested for reactivity to IFN-γ. All tracers except for [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS-anti-IFN-γ HL-9 exhibited comparable immunore-activities (>90 %) to the radiolabeled parent mAb (95.8 %). At 24 h post-labeling, the IRF values were retained except for the HL-13 construct. Imaging scans and tissue distribution studies acquired in mice bearing CT26 syngeneic colorectal tumors between 1 and 24 h post-tracer administration demonstrated variable clearance kinetics and tumor localization of each radiotracer. HL-7 had higher binding in non-tumor tissues compared to HL-11 and HL-13 at 3 h p.i. Competitive binding studies versus unmodified parent mAb (AN-18) demonstrated blocking of radiolabeled HL-11 and HL-13. [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS-anti-IFN-γ HL-7 was inadequately blocked.Conclusion:Despite nuanced differences in linker lengths, our data demonstrates that [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS-anti-IFN-γ HL-11 exhibited the best radiotracer properties for the assessment of IFN-γ production in vivo. Work is currently underway to test the potential of using shorter-lived isotopes, like copper-64 (t1/2 ~ 12.7 h) to match pharmacokinetics and half-lives.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDm6A methylation modification is a new regulatory mechanism involved in tumorigenesis and tumor-immunity interaction. However, its impact on glioma immune microenvironment and clinical outcome remains unclear. METHODSComprehensive expression profiles of 18 m6A regulators were used to identify molecular subtypes exhibiting distinct m6A modification patterns in 1673 glioma samples sourced from public datasets. A multi-genes signature was constructed for predicting clinical outcome and response to immunotherapy in glioma patients. Immunohistochemistry and cellular experiments were performed for validation. RESULTSTwo m6A subtypes of gliomas were identified. The m6A-low-risk subtype was characterized by paucity of immune infiltrates; Whereas the m6A-high-risk subtype had higher abundances of multiple immune cells including lymphocyte and macrophage as well as increased expression of PD-L1, corresponding to an immunosuppressive phenotype. The m6A-high-risk subtype had poorer survival than the m6A-low-risk subtype in both the glioblastoma and lower grade gliomas cohorts. Eight m6A-related hub genes of high prognostic significances were identified and selected for developing a scoring signature termed as m6Ascore. Elevated m6Ascore indicated worse survival for glioma patients under standard care, but showed enhanced response to immunotherapy. Moreover, we demonstrated that overexpression of FTO, a m6A demethylase, inhibited the expressions of m6A-related hub genes (PTX3, SPAG4), impaired glioma cell viability and reduced macrophage chemotaxis. CONCLUSIONThis work develops an immune- and clinical-relevant m6A subtyping and a scoring model, which enhances our understanding of the role of m6A modification in regulating immune infiltration microenvironment in gliomas and helps to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.","The tumor microenvironment and immune evasion function in a complex cellular network profoundly challenge the clinical outcome of promising therapies. Our recently published study reported that the subset of genes upregulated in ccRCC due to H3K4me1 and DNA demethylation potentially leads to an immunosuppressive environment. Thus, modulating H3K4me1 chromatin modifier SETD7 with a natural inhibitor in combination with immunotherapy might improve the immune landscape for a better therapeutic outcome. The present study was conducted via virtual screening and MD simulation using compounds from the literature, IMPPAT, and SuperNatural database. The phytochemical IMPHY002979 showed better binding affinity and lower energy than the reported R-PFI-2 and cyproheptadine inhibitors. The phytochemicals interact with the SET domain through H-bonding, as confirmed by MD simulation and molecular interaction analysis. Further, the compound was assessed using ADME parameters and free energy estimation, showing better pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, the non-accessibility of the histone methyltransferase activity domain of SET7 with IMPHY002979 can downregulate H3K4me1 and, thereby, the expression of genes potentially responsible for immunosuppressive TME. Thus, patient stratification based on molecular markers for immunotherapy and combining epigenetic modulators with therapeutic drugs will improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in ccRCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11030-024-11038-w.",0
"IntroductionPoliovirus receptor (PVR) is a tumor promoter and a regulatory checkpoint that enhances immunosuppression. We investigated PVR expression by applying immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A positive association existed between PVR expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) expression in patients with surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PVR expression is a prognosis predictor of lung adenocarcinoma.PurposeTo investigate the prognostic significance of PVR expression and CTLA4 expression for surgically resected NSCLC.Patients and methodsThe medical records of 108 Chinese patients with primary NSCLC who underwent surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of PVR and CTLA4 were measured through IHC. Clinical characteristics, the association between PVR and CTLA4, and the prognostic significance of PVR were analyzed.ResultsA significant positive association was observed between PVR and CTLA4 expression in NSCLC (P = 0.016). PVR had a high positive rate among females, nonsmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma and advanced lung cancer. The overall survival (OS) of patients with negative PVR expression was significantly longer than that of patients with positive PVR expression (P = 0.049), especially among females (P = 0.03) and nonsmokers (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis results showed that advanced tumor stage and PVR expression were independent prognosis predictors of poor OS.ConclusionPVR can potentially serve as a prognostic predictor and biomarker for NSCLC and cancer anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03189-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeBaseline tumor size (BTS) and the presence of massive lesions are important for predicting the clinical course of cancer. However, their impact on survival and clinical response in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment has been scarcely investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 294 patients who underwent ICI therapy for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between January 2016 and July 2019.ResultsOf these 294 patients, 284 (96.6%) had at least one measurable lesion. Of these, 263 patients treated with ICI monotherapy were included in the analysis. The median total and maximum target lesion diameters were 96.5 mm and 49.1 mm, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) with massive lesions (max BTS > 50 mm, group A) and without massive lesions (max BTS ≤ 50 mm, group B) was 2.5 months (95% CI 1.8–3.7) and 6.7 months (95% CI 5.1–9.7), respectively. Median overall survival (OS) for groups A and B was 9.5 months (95% CI 5.5–12.3) and 20.0 months (95% CI 13.3–32.0), respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between the presence of massive lesions and both PFS and OS.ConclusionThe presence of massive lesions (max diameters > 50 mm) is an independent prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC treated with ICI monotherapy. Although overall response rates were similar between groups A and B, the disease control rate was significantly poorer for group A. Max BTS might be useful for predicting clinical outcomes for patients undergoing immunotherapy as a parameter reflecting their tumor burden.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03271-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
