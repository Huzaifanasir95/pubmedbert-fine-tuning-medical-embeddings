"Currently, there are two approved vaccine regimens designed to prevent Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD). Both are virus-vectored, and concerns about cold-chain storage and pre-existing immunity to the vectors warrant investigating additional vaccine strategies. Here, we have explored the utility of adjuvanted recombinant glycoproteins (GPs) from ebolaviruses Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and Bundibugyo (BDBV) for inducing antibody (Ab) and T cell cross-reactivity. Glycoproteins expressed in insect cells were administered to C57BL/6 mice as free protein or bound to the surface of liposomes, and formulated with toll-like receptor agonists CpG and MPLA (agonists for TLR 9 and 4, respectively), with or without the emulsions AddaVax or TiterMax. The magnitude of Ab cross-reactivity in binding and neutralization assays, and T cell cross-reactivity in antigen recall assays, correlated with phylogenetic relatedness. While most adjuvants screened induced IgG responses, a combination of CpG, MPLA and AddaVax emulsion (“IVAX-1”) was the most potent and polarized in an IgG2c (Th1) direction. Breadth was also achieved by combining GPs into a trivalent (Tri-GP) cocktail with IVAX-1, which did not compromise antibody responses to individual components in binding and neutralizing assays. Th1 signature cytokines in T cell recall assays were undetectable after Tri-GP/IVAX-1 administration, despite a robust IgG2c response, although administration of Tri-GP on lipid nanoparticles in IVAX-1 elevated Th1 cytokines to detectable levels. Overall, the data indicate an adjuvanted trivalent recombinant GP approach may represent a path toward a broadly reactive, deployable vaccine against EVD.","AbstractBackgroundGlioma, characterized by limited lymphocytic infiltration, constitutes an “immune-desert” tumor displaying insensitivity to various immunotherapies. This study aims to explore therapeutic strategies for inducing tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation within the glioma microenvironment (GME) to transition it from an immune resistant to an activated state.MethodsTLS formation in GME was successfully induced by intracranial administration of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (OK-432, TLR2/4/9 agonist) and glioma antigens (i.c. αTLR-mix). We employed staining analysis, antibody neutralization, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), and BCR/TCR sequencing to investigate the underlying mechanisms of TLS formation and its role in anti-glioma immunity. Additionally, a preliminary translational clinical study was conducted.ResultsTLS formation correlated with increased lymphocyte infiltration in GME and led to improved prognosis in glioma-bearing mice. In the study of TLS induction mechanisms, certain macrophages/microglia and Th17 displayed markers of “LTo” and “LTi” cells, respectively, interaction through LTα/β-LTβR promoted TLS induction. Post-TLS formation, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells but not CD19 + B cells contributed to anti-glioma immunity. Comparative analysis of B/T cells between brain and lymph node showed that brain B/T cells unveiled the switch from naïve to mature, some B cells highlighted an enrichment of class switch recombination (CSR)-associated genes, V gene usage, and clonotype bias were observed. In related clinical studies, i.c. αTLR-mix treatment exhibited tolerability, and chemokines/cytokines assay provided preliminary evidence supporting TLS formation in GME.ConclusionsTLS induction in GME enhanced anti-glioma immunity, improved the immune microenvironment, and controlled glioma growth, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for treating glioma in the future.",1
"Aim: This study investigated the role of lncRNA LINC01232 in ferroptosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials & methods: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or western blot experiments were performed to examine relevant mRNAs and proteins expression. The kit assays evaluated malondialdehyde, iron, Fe2+ and glutathione levels. ROS levels were verified by flow cytometry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation analysis monitored the correlation among LINC01232, H3K27ac, p300 and ARNTL2.Results: LINC01232 or ARNTL2 knockdown facilitated erastin-induced ferroptosis. The interaction between LINC01232 and p300 resulted in the enhancement of H3K27ac levels at ARNTL2 promoter to promote ARNTL2 transcriptional activity. ARNTL2 overexpression reversed the promoting effect of LINC01232 knockdown on ferroptosis.Conclusion: LINC01232 inhibited the ferroptosis in CRC by epigenetically upregulating the transcriptional activity of ARNTL2.","Aim: This cohort study evaluated the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and mortality as well as ICI discontinuation among older adults with NSCLC.Methods: 2007–2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database was used and survival analysis with time-varying exposure of irAEs was applied to estimate the associations.Results & conclusion: A total of 8,175 individuals were included, with 46.8% of whom developed an irAE. Cox regression models showed the occurrence of any irAEs was associated with increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.63–1.82) and treatment discontinuation (HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.78–1.97). Some variability was observed in the effect on the two outcomes depending on the type of irAE.",0
"Genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells have become an effective treatment option for several advanced B-cell malignancies. Hematologic side effects, recently classified as immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), are very common and can predispose for clinically relevant infections. As hematopoietic reconstitution after CAR-T differs from chemotherapy-associated myelosuppression, a novel classification system for early and late ICAHT has been introduced. Furthermore, a risk-stratification score named CAR-HEMATOTOX has been developed to identify high-risk candidates, thereby enabling risk-based interventional strategies. Therapeutically, growth factor support with G-CSF represents the mainstay of treatment, with hematopoietic stem cell boosts available in G-CSF refractory cases. While the underlying pathophysiology remains enigmatic, recent translational studies suggest that CAR-T induced inflammation and baseline hematopoietic function are key contributors to prolonged cytopenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the spectrum of hematologic toxicities after CAR T-cell therapy and offer perspectives on future translational and clinical developments.","Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine whether MRI radiomic features of key cerebral structures differ between women and men, and whether detection of such differences depends on the image resolution.Materials and Methods:Ultrahigh resolution (UHR) 3D MP2RAGE (magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo) T1-weighted MR images (voxel size, 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm3) of the brain of 30 subjects (18 women and 12 men; mean age, 39.0 ± 14.8 years) without abnormal findings on MRI were retrospectively included. MRI was performed on a whole-body 7 T MR system. A convolutional neural network was used to segment the following structures: frontal cortex, frontal white matter, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and corpus callosum. Eighty-seven radiomic features were extracted respectively: gray-level histogram (n = 18), co-occurrence matrix (n = 24), run-length matrix (n = 16), size-zone matrix (n = 16), and dependence matrix (n = 13). Feature extraction was performed at UHR and, additionally, also after resampling to 1.4 × 1.4 × 1.4 mm3 voxel size (standard clinical resolution). Principal components (PCs) of radiomic features were calculated, and independent samples t tests with Cohen d as effect size measure were used to assess differences in PCs between women and men for the different cerebral structures.Results:At UHR, at least a single PC differed significantly between women and men in 6/7 cerebral structures: frontal cortex (d = −0.79, P = 0.042 and d = −1.01, P = 0.010), frontal white matter (d = −0.81, P = 0.039), thalamus (d = 1.43, P < 0.001), globus pallidus (d = 0.92, P = 0.020), caudate nucleus (d = −0.83, P = 0.039), and corpus callosum (d = −0.97, P = 0.039). At standard clinical resolution, only a single PC extracted from the corpus callosum differed between sexes (d = 1.05, P = 0.009).Conclusions:Nonnegligible differences in radiomic features of several key structures of the brain exist between women and men, and need to be accounted for. Very high spatial resolution may be required to uncover and further investigate the sexual dimorphism of brain structures on MRI.",0
"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) plays a key role in tumor immune escape. Besides being a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the first step of tryptophan catabolism, it also acts as a signal-transducing protein, whose partnering with tyrosine phosphatase Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase substrate (SHPs) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) regulatory subunit p85 promotes the establishment of a sustained immunosuppressive phenotype. While IDO1 inhibitors typically interfere with its enzymatic activity, we aimed to discover a more effective modulator capable of blocking not only the enzymatic but also the signaling-mediated functions of IDO1. By virtual screening, we identified the compound VS-15, which selectively binds the heme-free form of IDO1, inhibits its enzymatic activity, and reduces the IDO1-mediated signaling pathway by negatively interfering with its partnership with SHPs and PI3K regulatory subunit p85 as well as with the IDO1 anchoring to the early endosomes in tumor cells. Moreover, VS-15 counteracts the TGF-β—mediated immunosuppressive phenotype in dendritic cells and reduces the level of inhibition of T cell proliferation by suppressive monocytes isolated from patients affected by pancreatic cancer. Herein, we describe the discovery and characterization of a small molecule with an unprecedented mechanism of action, capable of inhibiting both the enzymatic and nonenzymatic activities of IDO1 by binding to its apo-form. These results pave the way for the development of next-generation IDO1 inhibitors with a unique competitive advantage over the currently available modulators, thereby opening therapeutic opportunities in cancer immunotherapy.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy may give rise to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), or gas within the bowel wall, has very rarely been observed following ICI therapy, and its clinical significance is unclear. We described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of PI as a possible irAE in cancer patients.MethodsWe retrospectively identified 12 adult cancer patients with radiologic evidence of PI within 1 year after ICI exposure during January 2010–January 2023. Clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were evaluated.ResultsThe median age of our sample was 64 years. The most common cancer types were thoracic/head & neck and gastrointestinal. Eleven patients (92%) received anti-PD-1/L1 monotherapy, while 1 patient (8%) received a combination of anti-PD-1/L1 and anti-CTLA-4. PI occurred a median of 7 months after the first ICI dose. Half the patients (50%) were asymptomatic on diagnosis, and the most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (42%). Six patients experienced complications, namely pneumoperitoneum (n = 6, 50%) and microperforation (n = 1, 8%), identified on imaging. Nine patients were treated with antibiotics and 3 patients were monitored conservatively. Nine patients (75%) resumed cancer treatment after PI.ConclusionPI may develop as an irAE. While half of cases were incidental radiologic findings, management with antibiotics as well as hospitalization for observation may still be appropriate. The decision to restart cancer therapy and possibly resume ICI therapy remains to be elucidated. Further large-scale studies may be warranted to clarify the association between PI and ICI therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05461-z.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that is capturing popular imagination and can revolutionize biomedicine. AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to break through existing barriers in oncology research and practice such as automating workflow processes, personalizing care, and reducing healthcare disparities. Emerging applications of AI/ML in the literature include screening and early detection of cancer, disease diagnosis, response prediction, prognosis, and accelerated drug discovery. Despite this excitement, only few AI/ML models have been properly validated and fewer have become regulated products for routine clinical use. In this review, we highlight the main challenges impeding AI/ML clinical translation. We present different clinical use cases from the domains of radiology, radiation oncology, immunotherapy, and drug discovery in oncology. We dissect the unique challenges and opportunities associated with each of these cases. Finally, we summarize the general requirements for successful AI/ML implementation in the clinic, highlighting specific examples and points of emphasis including the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration of stakeholders, role of domain experts in AI augmentation, transparency of AI/ML models, and the establishment of a comprehensive quality assurance program to mitigate risks of training bias and data drifts, all culminating toward safer and more beneficial AI/ML applications in oncology labs and clinics.","A larger percentage of our population is aging healthily and living on to a ripe old age. 60 years of age is taken as cut-off for identifying geriatric population for the purpose of specialized healthcare. The incidence of cancer is increasing and its expected more so in the geriatric population. At present , there are a limited cancer centres where specialized geriatric clinic is being conducted.Some of the the key unmet needs are — lack of resources and time for dedicated geriatric screening, lack of validated interventions and lack of awareness about the field of geriatric oncology. Some of the proposed solutions are increasing orientation and exposure of trainees and early career oncologists as well as carrying out country specific research to find useful interventions in this field.",1
"The study investigated the efficacy of Campomanesia xanthocarpa infusions on human melanoma cells (SK-MEL-28). The phytochemical profile revealed 18 phenolic compounds in the leaf infusion and 9 in the fruit infusion. After 24 h of treatment, the infusions demonstrated antineoplastic effects, reducing cell viability at all tested concentrations for the leaf infusion. For the fruit infusion, a significant reduction in cell viability was observed specifically at the 800 μg/mL concentration. Fluorescence microscopy and mitochondrial membrane potential results indicated that the leaf infusion was more effective in reducing cell viability and mitochondrial function in SK-MEL-28 cells, possibly due to its greater variety of phenolic compounds compared to the fruit infusion. The leaf infusion also induced higher production of intracellular reactive oxygen species compared to the fruit infusion. Protein sulfhydryl levels were reduced for the leaf infusion. Epigallocatechin gallate, Isoquercitrin, Rutin, Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, Chlorogenic acid, and Ellagic acid were identified as the main compounds with activity against SK-MEL-28 cells. Molecular docking analysis underscored factors such as affinity, cavity size, binding mode, and contact residues with specific compounds chosen for their favorable properties in targeting BRAF, CDK4, CDK6, MEK1, and MEK2. The variability in binding affinities may directly influence the compounds' ability to inhibit different signaling pathways related to cancer cell growth and proliferation. The results suggest that phenolic compounds from C. xanthocarpa extracts have therapeutic potential and could contribute to melanoma therapies.Supplementary informationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40203-024-00286-1.","BackgroundIn CLEAR, lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (L+P) significantly improved efficacy versus sunitinib in first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We report results from CLEAR biomarker analyses.MethodsPD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing assays (whole exome sequencing/RNA-sequencing) were performed on archival tumor specimens.For IHC-derived/RNA-sequencing analyses, a continuous analysis was performed adjusting by Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score for: PD-L1 CPS versus best overall response (BOR)/PFS; and each gene-signature score (T-cell inflamed gene-expression profile [TcellinfGEP]/non-TcellinfGEP signatures including proliferation and angiogenesis) versus BOR/PFS.Association between mutation status of RCC driver genes and PFS were analyzed for genes for which ≥20 patients per arm had oncogenic alterations. Association of molecular subtypes with outcome was evaluated with baseline KPS adjustments. The set of biomarkers evaluated and statistical significance criteria for PD-L1 CPS, gene signature scores, and molecular subtypes were pre-specified.ResultsWithin-arm analyses using continuous values showed no association between PD-L1 levels and BOR/PFS for either treatment.PFS hazard ratios between arms were similar regardless of mutant or wildtype subgroups of RCC driver genes (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, KDM5C).No associations between PFS and gene-signature scores were observed for L+P. With sunitinib, high proliferation and MYC signature scores showed shorter PFS; high angiogenesis and microvessel density signature scores showed longer PFS.Six new molecular subtypes were defined. Tumors of patients with favorable/intermediate risk were enriched in angiogenesis and angiogenesis/stromal clusters; those with poor risk were enriched in proliferative and unclassified (low-TcellinfGEP/low-angiogenesis/low-proliferation) clusters. No association between molecular subtypes and PFS for L+P/sunitinib was observed (after adjustment for KPS and gene signatures that were individually associated with PFS).ConclusionsImprovements in ORR and PFS for L+P versus sunitinib in aRCC were observed consistently across a range of biomarker subgroups defined using RCC driver mutations, PD-L1, gene expression signatures, and molecular subtypes.",0
"Background:Axitinib plus pembrolizumab showed superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) versus sunitinib in a randomised phase III trial in patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). We report long-term efficacy and safety of the axitinib/pembrolizumab from the phase I trial (NCT02133742), after 46–55 months from study initiation (data cut-off date, 23rd July 2019).Methods:Fifty-two treatment-naïve patients with advanced RCC were treated with oral axitinib 5 mg twice daily and intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. PFS, duration of response (DoR) and OS were summarised using the Kaplan–Meier method.Results:At a median follow-up of 42.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.1–44.1), median OS was not reached; 38 (73.1%) patients were alive. The probability of being alive at 4 years was 66.8% (95% CI: 49.1–79.5). Median PFS in the overall population was 23.5 months (95% CI: 15.4–30.4). ORR was 73.1%; five patients had complete response. Median DoR was 22.1 months (95% CI: 15.1–34.5). Grade III/IV adverse events (AEs) were reported in 38 (73.1%) patients and 20 (38.5%) discontinued treatment because of AEs: 17 (32.7%) discontinued axitinib, 13 (25.0%) discontinued pembrolizumab, and 10 (19.2%) discontinued both drugs. Common AEs included diarrhoea (84.6%), fatigue (80.8%), hypertension (53.8%), cough (48.1%) and dysphonia (48.1%). There were no new AE terms reported and no treatment-related deaths.Conclusions:In patients with advanced RCC with ~4 years of follow-up, combination axitinib/pembrolizumab continued to demonstrate clinical benefit, with no new safety signals.","PurposeAn increasing number of patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are benefiting from immunotherapy. However, the individual immune profile of patients who respond to treatment is unclear. Multiple programmed cell death (PCD) patterns play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells, predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy using a risk model for programmed cell death gene combinations LUSC risk model.MethodsGenes associated with 12 types of PCD were analyzed to establish a prognostic model. Risk scores were calculated using PCDG-based expression profiles, and LUSC patients were classified into two groups. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) characteristics and immunotherapy responses were compared between the two groups. Finally, staging was predicted using the extreme gradient boosting tree algorithm (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), and an algorithmic model was constructed to predict the prognosis of LUSC patients based on the PCDG risk score.ResultsA stepwise downscaling of 1256 PCDGs was performed to screen out 16 genes associated with LUSC prognosis to construct a risk model. Immune cell infiltration levels, the immunotherapy response, and prognostic differences were different between these two groups of patients. The classification prediction model based on the XGBoost algorithm and the prognostic model based on the risk score were able to distinguish the risk subtypes and individual prognosis of LUSC patients, respectively.ConclusionsPCD patterns exert a crucial effect on the development of LUSC. An evaluation of different PCD patterns in LUSC improves the understanding of the characteristics of infiltrating immune cells and mutational features of the TIME, distinguishes LUSC patients who might benefit from immunotherapy, and predicts their future survival.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04789-w.",0
"ABSTRACTAimsTo investigate mechanism of lncRNA SNHG12 induced macrophage-myofibroblast transition (MMT) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodCAFs EVs were isolated from human NSCLC tissue and adjacent cancerous tissue (n = 3), and their morphology and particle size were evaluated. Macrophages and MMT cells with different phenotypes were detected, and the binding relationship of lncRNA SNHG12, miR-181a-5p, and Smad3 was verified.ResultLncRNA SNHG12 derived from CAFs-EVs promoted the transformation of M2 macrophages into MMT.

Studies identify roles for P2 purinergic receptors in tumor cells that drive disease aggressiveness. There is also sufficient evidence that P2 purinergic receptor expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for disease initiation and progression. Immune cells constitute a significant component of the TME and display both tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic potential. Studies pre-dating the investigation of P2 purinergic receptors in cancer identify P2 receptor expression on multiple immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, T-cells, and dendritic cells; all of which are implicated in tumor initiation, tumor promotion, or response to treatment. Herein, we discuss P2 purinergic receptor expression and function in tumor-related immune cells. We provide a rationale for further investigations of P2 purinergic receptors within the TME to better define the mechanistic pathways of inflammation-mediate tumorigenesis and explore P2 purinergic receptors as potential targets for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.",1
"ABSTRACTCheckpoint inhibitor myocarditis is a rare but life-threatening toxicity of immunotherapy, occasionally manifesting as persistent troponin elevation. Dual checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab and nivolumab has been found to induce immune-related myocarditis in patients with metastatic melanoma. We herein report a case of smoldering immune-related myocarditis in a 54-year-old male after a single infusion of nivolumab plus ipilimumab as adjuvant treatment for completely resected stage IV melanoma. High-dose steroid treatment resulted in decrease in the levels of cardiac enzymes, without any major complications.","AbstractBackgroundThis investigator-initiated phase II trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (CaboNivoIpi) in previously treated patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.MethodsEligible patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who progressed on 1 prior line of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapy received a 2-week run-in of cabozantinib monotherapy followed by CaboNivoIpi for 4 cycles (cycle length = 6 weeks), followed by cabozantinib plus nivolumab (cycle length = 4 weeks) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) within the first 6 months of treatment. A Simon optimal 2-stage design allowed for an interim analysis after accrual of 10 evaluable patients. At least 5 responses were needed to proceed to stage 2.ResultsAmong 11 patients enrolled, the median age was 69 years. Prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted therapies included lenvatinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib plus everolimus. Median follow-up was 13.4 months. Among 10 evaluable patients, ORR within the first 6 months of treatment was 10% (1 partial response). Median progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI, 3.0–not reached) and median overall survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 4.6–not reached). Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were noted in 55% (6/11) and grade 5 AEs in 18% (2/11) of patients. The most common treatment-related AE was hypertension. The study did not reach its prespecified efficacy threshold.ConclusionCaboNivoIpi had low ORRs and a high rate of grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs.Clinical Trial RegistrationNCT03914300",1
"PurposeColorectal cancer, as a common malignant tumor, poses a serious threat to human life. Cordycepin, derived from Cordyceps militaris extract, which was established as a capable inhibitor of tumor growth. Nevertheless, the precise antitumor mechanism of cordycepin in colorectal cancer cells remains elusive.MethodsHerein, our initial focus was to explore the tumor-suppressive impact of cordycepin through its influence on various biological functions in murine colorectal cancer cells, conducted by an in vitro setting. First, we investigated the tumor-suppressive effect of cordycepin on the regulation of biological functions in murine colorectal cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, we evaluated the in vivo antitumor potential of cordycepin using a mouse preclinical tumor model, and further explored the antitumor mechanism.ResultsOur findings revealed that cordycepin effectively inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of murine colon cancer cells. Moreover, there is a substantial reduction in the expression of PD-L1 observed in tumor cells, in response to cordycepin treatment. Collectively, these results demonstrate the significant tumor-suppressive attributes of cordycepin against colorectal cancer. Consequently, our study lays a solid foundation for the potential clinical utilization of cordycepin in cancer therapy.ConclusionCordycepin inhibits the biological functions of colorectal cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth by reducing the expression of PD-L1.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05460-0.","PurposeIn the complex tumor scenario, understanding the function of proteins with protumor or antitumor roles is essential to support advances in the cancer clinical area. Among them, the salvador family WW domain-containing protein 1 (SAV1) is highlighted. This protein plays a fundamental role in the tumor suppressor face of the Hippo pathway, which are responsible for controlling cell proliferation, organ size, development and tissue homeostasis. However, the functional dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. As SAV1 is a tumor suppressor scaffold protein, we explored the functions performed by SAV1 with its partners, the regulation of its expression, and its antitumor role in various types of cancer.MethodsWe selected and analyzed 80 original articles and reviews from Pubmed that focuses on the study of SAV1 in cancer.ResultsSAV1 interacts with several proteins, has different functions and acts as tumor suppressor by other mechanisms besides Hippo pathway. SAV1 expression regulation seems to occur by microRNAs and rarely by mutation or promoter methylation. It is downregulated in different types of cancer, which leads to cancer promotion and progression and is associated with poor prognosis. In vivo models have shown that the loss of SAV1 contributes to tumorigenesis.ConclusionSAV1 plays a relevant role as tumor suppressor in several types of cancer, highlighting SAV1 and the Hippo pathway's importance to cancer. Thus, encouraging further studies to include the SAV1 as a molecular key piece in cancer biology and in clinical approaches to cancer.",0
"PurposeCell death plays an important role in tumourigenesis and progression; nevertheless, the clinical significance of cell death-related genes in neuroblastoma remains incompletely understood.MethodsWe separately constructed the corresponding risk scores for each of the eight cell death pathways separately and assessed their predictive performance. Through Cox regression analysis, these eight risk scores were integrated to obtain final cell death risk scores (CDRS). We evaluated the predictive performance of CDRS in multiple datasets and compared its accuracy with the clinical characteristics of patients and some existing prognostic models for neuroblastoma. We then explored the differences in immune infiltration between the high and low CDRS groups, and the significance of CDRS on EFS and disease progression.ResultsAll eight risk scores have high predictive accuracy, with the Immunogenic-RS being the most accurate and the cuproptosis-RS the least accurate. Model genes are mainly enriched in a variety of cancer-related pathways and are closely related to the clinical characteristics. CDRS showed superior and robust predictive performance in multiple datasets and was more accurate than the clinical characteristics of patients and some existing prognostic models for neuroblastoma. High CDRS group featured distinct immune cold tumor profiles and may have poorer immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy. CDRS had significance in predicting EFS and disease progression.ConclusionWe integrated risk scores associated with multiple cell death pathways to develop a high-performing and robust neuroblastoma signature. CDRS was a promising tool that may help with risk assessment and prediction of overall prognosis, and thus improve clinical outcomes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04605-5.","PurposeTo develop and validate a nomogram for predicting survival in intermediate- and high-risk neuroblastoma patients and to compare the accuracy of the nomogram in predicting survival with Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk stratification.MethodsA total of 885 intermediate- and high-risk neuroblastoma patients were enrolled in this study, including 243 patients from our hospital (the training set) and 642 patients from the TARGET database (the validation set). The factors related to event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in neuroblastoma were determined to construct the nomogram by Cox regression analysis. The C-index, calibration curves, and area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were used to assess the predictive performance of the nomogram.ResultsInternational Neuroblastoma Staging System stage and Mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI) were significant unfavorable factors for EFS, while MKI and MYCN status were significant unfavorable factors for OS. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.621 and 0.586 for predicting EFS, 0.650 and 0.570 for predicting OS in the training and validation sets, respectively. The calibration curves revealed good agreement in the EFS and OS predicted by the nomogram. The AUCs of the nomogram for 1-, 2-, 3-year EFS and OS were 0.633, 0.669, 0.604 and 0.672, 0.670, 0.702 in the training set, respectively. Moreover, the nomogram was able to classify patients into two groups according to risk scores, with the “high-risk” group having a lower survival rate than the “intermediate-risk” group. And the nomogram performed better than the COG risk stratification, which had a C-index of 0.537, 0.502 and 0.565, 0.572 for predicting EFS, OS in the training and validation sets, respectively.ConclusionWe developed and validated a prognostic nomogram for intermediate- and high-risk neuroblastoma patients that clinicians can use to make more informed decisions for individual patients.",1
"BackgroundThe incidence of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), one of the most aggressive and lethal skin tumors, is increasing worldwide. However, for advanced SKCM, we still lack an accurate and valid way to predict its prognosis, as well as novel theories to guide the planning of treatment options for SKCM patients. Lactylation (LAC), a novel post-translational modification of histones, has been shown to promote tumor growth and inhibit the antitumor response of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a variety of ways. We hope that this study will provide new ideas for treatment options for SKCM patients, as well as research on the molecular mechanisms of SKCM pathogenesis and development.MethodsAt the level of the RNA sequencing set (TCGA, GTEx), we used differential expression analysis, LASSO regression analysis, and multifactor Cox regression analysis to screen for prognosis-related genes and calculate the corresponding LAC scores. The content of TME cells in the tumor tissue was calculated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and the TME score was calculated based on its results. Finally, the LAC–TME classifier was established and further analyzed based on the two scores, including the construction of a prognostic model, analysis of clinicopathological characteristics, and correlation analysis of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immunotherapy. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, this study analyzed the cellular composition in SKCM tissues and explored the role of LAC scores in intercellular communication. To validate the functionality of the pivotal gene CLPB in the model, cellular experiments were ultimately executed.ResultsWe screened a total of six prognosis-related genes (NDUFA10, NDUFA13, CLPB, RRM2B, HPDL, NARS2) and 7 TME cells with good prognosis. According to Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, we found that the LAClow/TMEhigh group had the highest overall survival (OS) and the LAChigh/TMElow group had the lowest OS (p value < 0.05). In further analysis of immune infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME), functional enrichment, tumor mutational load and immunotherapy, we found that immunotherapy was more appropriate in the LAClow/TMEhigh group. Moreover, the cellular assays exhibited substantial reductions in proliferation, migration, and invasive potentials of melanoma cells in both A375 and A2058 cell lines upon CLPB knockdown.ConclusionsThe prognostic model using the combined LAC score and TME score was able to predict the prognosis of SKCM patients more consistently, and the LAC–TME classifier was able to significantly differentiate the prognosis of SKCM patients across multiple clinicopathological features. The LAC–TME classifier has an important role in the development of immunotherapy regimens for SKCM patients.","BackgroundColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, which imposes a significant societal burden. Regular screening and emerging molecular tumor markers have important implications for detecting the progression and development of colorectal cancer. Disulfidptosis is a newly defined type of programmed cell death triggered by abnormal accumulation of disulfide compounds in cells that stimulate disulfide stress. Currently, there is no relevant discussion on this mechanism and colorectal cancer.MethodsWe classified the disulfidptosis-related subtypes of colorectal cancer using bioinformatics methods. Through secondary clustering of differentially expressed genes between subtypes, we identified characteristic genes of the disulfidptosis subtype, constructed a prognostic model, and searched for potential biomarkers through clinical validation.ResultsUsing disulfidptosis-related genes collected from the literature, we classified colorectal cancer patients from public databases into three subtypes. The differentially expressed genes between subtypes were clustered into three gene subtypes, and eight characteristic genes were screened to construct a prognostic model.ConclusionThe disulfidptosis mechanism has important value in the classification of colorectal cancer patients, and characteristic genes selected based on this mechanism can serve as a new potential biological marker for colorectal cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05211-1.",1
"AbstractBackground:B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy yield remarkable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/RMM). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) reportedly exhibits distinct advantages in addressing the challenges posed by tumor heterogeneity in the distribution and genetic variations in R/RMM.Methods:Herein, the ctDNA of 108 peripheral blood plasma samples from patients with R/RMM at the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University was thoroughly investigated before administration of anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy to establish its predictive potential. Flow cytometry is used primarily to detect subgroups of T cells or CAR-T cells.Results:In this study, several tumor and T cell effector-mediated factors were considered to be related to treatment failure by an integrat analysis, including higher percentages of multiple myeloma (MM) cells in the bone marrow (P = 0.0125), lower percentages of CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood at peak (P = 0.0375), and higher percentages of CD8+ T cells (P = 0.0340). Furthermore, there is a substantial correlation between high ctDNA level (>143 ng/mL) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.007). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high levels of ctDNA (>143 ng/mL), MM-driven high-risk mutations (including IGLL5 [P = 0.004], IRF4 [P = 0.024], and CREBBP [P = 0.041]), number of multisite mutations, and resistance-related mutation (ERBB4, P = 0.040) were independent risk factors for PFS.Conclusion:Finally, a ctDNA-based risk model was built based on the above independent risk factors, which serves as an adjunct non-invasive measure of substantial tumor burden and a prognostic genetic feature that can assist in predicting the response to anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy.Registeration:Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100046474) and National Clinical Trial (NCT04670055, NCT05430945).","Purpose Daratumumab is a novel, first-in-class monoclonal antibody approved for use as monotherapy and in combination with other treatments for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of daratumumab in real-world clinical practice.Materials and Methods This observational multicenter study collected data from patients with MM treated in Korea between June 1, 2018, and February 28, 2022.Results A total of 125 patients with a diagnosis of MM were included and followed until discontinuation or completion of 52 weeks’ follow-up. The median age was 67 years, and 97.6% of patients received more than three prior lines of therapy. The overall response rate was 52.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.2 to 61.8), and a very good partial response was observed in 19.5% of patients (95% CI, 12.8 to 27.8). Of the patients who achieved a partial or higher response (52.5%), the median time to first response was 2.4 months (95% CI, 1.8 to 3.4), and the median time from start of daratumumab treatment until progressive disease was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.1). Fever (24.0%) was the most frequently recorded adverse event (AE), while anemia (8.8%) and neutropenia (8.0%) were the most frequently observed grade 3-4 AEs. Overall, no unexpected safety signals were observed.Conclusion In a rapidly evolving treatment landscape, this analysis provides insight into the real-world outcomes for patients with MM receiving daratumumab in Korea and reveals that real-world outcomes were improved over results demonstrated in a clinical trial setting.",1
"IntroductionMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, treatment-resistant tumor. Anoikis is a particular type of programmed apoptosis brought on by the separation of cell–cell or extracellular matrix (ECM). Anoikis has been recognized as a crucial element in the development of tumors. However, few studies have comprehensively examined the role of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in malignant mesothelioma.MethodsARGs were gathered from the GeneCard database and the Harmonizome portals. We obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the GEO database. Univariate Cox regression analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were utilized to select ARGs associated with the prognosis of MPM. We then developed a risk model, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves were employed to confirm the ability of the model. The patients were divided into various subgroups using consensus clustering analysis. Based on the median risk score, patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups. Functional analysis and immune cell infiltration analysis were conducted to estimate molecular mechanisms and the immune infiltration landscape of patients. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis and tumor microenvironment landscape were further explored.ResultsA novel risk model was constructed based on the six ARGs. The patients were successfully divided into two subgroups by consensus clustering analysis, with a striking difference in the prognosis and landscape of immune infiltration. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that the OS rate of the low-risk group was significantly higher than the high-risk group. Functional analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis showed that high- and low-risk groups had different immune statuses and drug sensitivity.ConclusionsIn summary, we developed a novel risk model to predict MPM prognosis based on six selected ARGs, which could broaden comprehension of personalized and precise therapy approaches for MPM.","Introduction:In 2018, durvalumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as consolidation immunotherapy for patients with stage III NSCLC after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, whether durvalumab benefits patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC remains unknown.Methods:We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC who completed concurrent CRT. Kaplan-Meier analyses evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who completed CRT with or without durvalumab.Results:Among 37 patients, 13 initiated durvalumab a median of 20 days after CRT completion. Two patients completed 12 months of treatment, with five patients discontinuing durvalumab owing to progression and five owing to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Of 24 patients who completed CRT without durvalumab, 16 completed CRT alone and eight completed CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Median PFS was 10.3 months in patients who received CRT and durvalumab versus 6.9 months with CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.993). CRT and EGFR TKI was associated with a significantly longer median PFS (26.1 mo) compared with CRT and durvalumab or CRT alone (log-rank p = 0.023). Six patients treated with durvalumab initiated EGFR TKIs after recurrence, with one developing grade 4 pneumonitis on osimertinib.Conclusions:In this study, patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC did not benefit with consolidation durvalumab and experienced a high frequency of irAEs. Patients who initiate osimertinib after durvalumab may be susceptible to incident irAEs. Consolidation durvalumab should be approached with caution in this setting and concurrent CRT with induction or consolidation EGFR TKIs further investigated as definitive treatment.",0
"ObjectiveTreatment beyond progression (TBP) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is an evolving field due to the limitations of conventional imaging in response evaluation. However, real-life data on the benefit of TBP is scarce, especially from the limited resource settings and patients treated in the later lines. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the survival benefit of TBP with ICIs in patients with advanced tumors from a limited resource setting.MethodsFor this multi-center retrospective cohort study, we included 282 patients treated with ICIs and had radiological progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. We evaluated post-progression survival according to the use of TBP (TBP and non-TBP groups) with univariate and multivariate analyses.ResultsThe cohort’s median age was 61, and 84.4% were treated in the second or later lines. 82 (29.1%) of 282 patients continued on ICIs following the initial progression. In multivariate analyses, patients in the TBP group had improved post-progression survival compared to non-TBP (13.18 vs. 4.63 months, HR: 0.500, 95% CI: 0.349–0.717, p < 0.001). The benefit of the TBP was independent of the tumor type, treatment line, and age. Furthermore, TBP with ICIs remained associated with improved post-progression survival (HR: 0.600, 95% CI: 0.380–0.947, p = 0.028) after excluding the patients with no further treatment after progression in the non-TBP arm.ConclusionsIn this study, we observed that patients receiving ICIs beyond progression had considerably longer survival. Continuation of ICIs after progression should be considered a reasonable management option for patients with advanced cancer, specifically for patients with limited alternative options.","Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been associated with susceptibility and protection against a number of cancers. Here we used an immunogenetic epidemiological approach to evaluate the overall influence of 127 HLA Class I and II alleles on 30 types of cancer. We found a preponderance of protective alleles (negatively correlated with cancer prevalences), especially for HLA Class I. Of the 30 cancers investigated, 13 were associated with mostly protective HLA effects whereas only 2 were associated with mostly susceptibility HLA alleles. Taken together, these findings highlight the broad influence of HLA on cancer and the complexity of HLA-cancer associations.",0
"BackgroundIn the literature, men are often described as unwilling to use healthcare services, whereas women as frequent users. We conducted a systematic literature review to examine the gender differences in healthcare utilisation of lung cancer patients. Our aim was to synthesise evidence to assess whether men and women utilise cancer diagnosis and treatments differently.MethodsThe databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO Host, Ovid nursing, and Cochrane was systematically searched. We used pre-defined eligibility criteria to identify peer-reviewed published literature that reported healthcare use of lung cancer patients. Two reviewers independently screened the title, abstract, full texts and retrieved relevant data.ResultsA total of 42 studies met the eligibility criteria from 1356 potential studies. In these studies, the most commonly measured healthcare utilisation is surgery (n = 19), followed by chemotherapy (n = 13). All the studies were from developed countries and had a higher percentage of male participants. Substantial evidence of heterogeneity in the use of treatments by gender were found. In relation to diagnosis interval and stage of cancer diagnosis, it was found that women had longer diagnostic intervals. Nonetheless, women tend to get diagnosed at an earlier stage. Furthermore, women had a higher probability of using inpatient cancer-care services and surgical treatments. Conversely, men had greater risks of readmission after surgery and longer length of stay. Lastly, there were no significant gender differences in the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy.ConclusionThis study synthesised evidence of disparities in the use of lung cancer treatments based on gender in developed countries, with no evidence available from least-developed and developing countries. Further studies are required to understand this gender-specific inequality and to design interventions to improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03197-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","PurposeEwing sarcoma (ES) is one of the most common malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents. The immune microenvironment plays an important role in the development of ES. Here, we developed an optimal signature for determining ES patient prognosis based on immune-related genes (IRGs).MethodsWe analyzed the ES gene expression profile dataset, GSE17679, from the GEO database and extracted differential expressed IRGs (DEIRGs). Then, we conducted functional correlation and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses of the DEIRGs and used the machine learning algorithm-iterative Lasso Cox regression analysis to build an optimal DEIRG signature. In addition, we applied ES samples from the ICGC database to test the optimal gene signature. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regressions on clinicopathological characteristics and optimal gene signature to evaluate whether signature is an important prognostic factor. Finally, we calculated the infiltration of 24 immune cells in ES using the ssGSEA algorithm, and analyzed the correlation between the DEIRGs in the optimal gene signature and immune cells.ResultsA total of 249 DEIRGs were screened and an 11-gene signature with the strongest correlation with patient prognoses was analyzed using a machine learning algorithm. The 11-gene signature also had a high prognostic value in the ES external verification set. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that 11-gene signature is an independent prognostic factor. We found that macrophages and cytotoxic, CD8 T, NK, mast, B, NK CD56bright, TEM, TCM, and Th2 cells were significantly related to patient prognoses; the infiltration of cytotoxic and CD8 T cells in ES was significantly different. By correlating prognostic biomarkers with immune cell infiltration, we found that FABP4 and macrophages, and NDRG1 and Th2 cells had the strongest correlation.ConclusionOverall, the IRG-related 11-gene signature can be used as a reliable ES prognostic biomarker and can provide guidance for personalized ES therapy.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03396-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting in millions of infections and deaths worldwide. Although vaccines are available, they appear to be less efficacious against newly emerging variants of the virus. Thus, therapeutic modalities are urgently needed. The coronavirus genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and envelope (E) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete viral particle. N protein is one of the most abundant structural proteins, participates in the regulation of viral replication and virion assembly, and is a major immunogen in coronavirus infection-induced disease. Sialylation is the addition of sialic acids to the terminal glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which act as key components for biological functions of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Sialidases (or neuraminidases) are glycosidases that remove sialic acid residues (desialylation) from glycan portions of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Through desialylation, sialidases modulate the functionality of sialic acid-containing molecules and are involved in both physiological and pathological pathways. This review aims to explore the current understanding of NEU1’s involvement in coronavirus infection and pathogenesis, synthesizing available research and identifying areas for future investigation.","AbstractBackgroundAs an extended analysis of the COVID-DELAY study, we aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnosis, staging, and survival outcomes among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis performed from 2019 to 2022.MethodsAll consecutive newly diagnosed CRC patients referred to 11 Italian Oncology Departments between March and December 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 were enrolled. Access rate, demographics, diagnostic-therapeutic temporal intervals, and first-line progression-free survival (PFS) and OS among metastatic patients were assessed.ResultsCompared to 2019 (n = 690), an initial global reduction in new CRC cases in 2020 (n = 564, –18.3%) was observed, followed by a progressive increase in new CRC diagnoses in 2021 (n = 748, + 8.4%) and 2022 (n = 756, + 9.6%); a higher rate of TNM stage IV tumors was diagnosed in 2020 (35.4%) and 2021 (31.0%) compared to 2019 (29.6%), with normalization in 2022 (26.4%) (P < .001). Not clinically relevant differences between histological diagnosis and first oncological examination, cytohistological diagnosis and systemic treatment start, first oncological appointment and systemic treatment start, treatment start and first radiological assessment between 2020 and 2021-2022 years were found. After propensity score matching according to the year of diagnosis, median OS was significantly worse in 2020, 2021, and 2022 compared to 2019 (27.6 vs 24.8 vs not reached vs 38.9 months, respectively) (P < .001). Concordantly, the median PFS was significantly worse with each passing year: 13.0 vs 11.1 vs 9.2 vs 7.2 months in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively (P = .00027).ConclusionsA progressive normalization in the rate of new CRC diagnosis as well as TNM stages at diagnosis, in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2020 and 2019, was found. The increase in new CRC cases might have affected some diagnostic-therapeutic time intervals in 2021-2022 years compared to 2020. Significantly, compared to the pre-pandemic phase, pandemic years were independently associated with worse PFS and OS outcomes in patients affected by metastatic disease.",1
"BackgroundTrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells and many malignant tumor cells. However, data on TROP2 expression in advanced lung cancer are insufficient, and its changes have not been fully evaluated.MethodsWe assessed the prevalence and changes in TROP2 expression in patients with lung cancer who received anti-cancer treatments using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with an anti-TROP2 antibody (clone: SP295). IHC scores were graded from 0 to 3; grade ≥ 2 was considered positive for TROP2 expression. We defined a difference in IHC score, before and after anti-cancer treatments, as the change in TROP2 expression.ResultsBefore anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 89% (143/160) of the patients and was significantly more common in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma than in neuroendocrine carcinoma (P < 0.001). After anti-cancer treatment, TROP2 expression was observed in 87% (139/160) of the patients. The distribution of TROP2 expression in post-treatment samples was analogous to that in pre-treatment samples when compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P = 0.509). However, an increase in TROP2 expression was seen in 19 (12%), and a decrease in 20 (13%) patients. Patients treated with targeted therapy showed significantly higher changes in TROP2 expression (P = 0.019) and thoracic radiotherapy was more likely to increase TROP2 expression than chemotherapy alone.ConclusionAlthough some anti-cancer treatments might alter the TROP2 expression, TROP2 was expressed in most lung cancer specimens before and after anti-cancer treatments. These results support the development of TROP2-directed therapy against advanced lung cancer in various treatment lines.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03784-3.","Background:The literature regarding clinical olfaction, olfactory loss, and olfactory dysfunction has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, with an exponential rise in the past year. There is substantial variability in the quality of this literature and a need to consolidate and critically review the evidence. It is with that aim that we have gathered experts from around the world to produce this International Consensus on Allergy and Rhinology: Olfaction (ICAR:O).Methods:Using previously described methodology, specific topics were developed relating to olfaction. Each topic was assigned a literature review, evidence-based review, or evidence-based review with recommendations format as dictated by available evidence and scope within the ICAR:O document. Following iterative reviews of each topic, the ICAR:O document was integrated and reviewed by all authors for final consensus.Results:The ICAR:O document reviews nearly 100 separate topics within the realm of olfaction, including diagnosis, epidemiology, disease burden, diagnosis, testing, etiology, treatment, and associated pathologies.Conclusion:This critical review of the existing clinical olfaction literature provides much needed insight and clarity into the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with olfactory dysfunction, while also clearly delineating gaps in our knowledge and evidence base that we should investigate further.",0
"ObjectiveImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been validated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, there exists no evidence regarding NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, experiencing EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment failure. We collected clinical information from real world and conducted a time series-based meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations and experienced EGFR-TKIs resistance.MethodsTwenty-two NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations after TKI resistance were included from two hospitals. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literature published until December 31, 2021. Endpoint outcomes included mortality and progression-free survival (PFS) at different times of follow-up.ResultsIn total, 22 patients showed that the median PFS was 5.6 months (range 2.0–9.0 months). According to treatment strategies, the median PFS was 2.4 months (range 2.0–5.3 months) in the ICI monotherapy group and 5.9 months (range 2.8–9.0 months) in the ICI combined Chemotherapy group. Additionally, sixteen studies, including 5 trials, 10 controlled cohorts and 1 real-world study, were assessed, involving a total of ICI-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation after TKI failure. The 6-month survival and PFS rate were 0.82 (95% CI 0.36–0.97) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.34–0.74), respectively. ICI combined chemotherapy showed the best survival outcome among these groups, as demonstrated by the 12-month survival rate and PFS. No new safety signals were identified with the combination therapy. The frequency of treatment-related adverse events was similar to that in previously reported studies of chemotherapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors.ConclusionsThe addition of ICIs plus chemotherapy may significantly improve progression-free survival among patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who EGFR-TKIs resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04176-x.","AbstractBackgroundStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with brain metastases (BM) is associated with a risk of distant intracranial failure (DIF). This study evaluates the impact of integrating dedicated 3D fast/turbo spin echo (3D-TSE) sequences to MPRAGE in BM detection and DIF prolongation in a histology-agnostic patient cohort.MethodsThe study population included adults treated with SRS from February 2019 to January 2024 who underwent MPRAGE alone or dual sequence with the addition of 3D-TSE starting from February 2020. Median times to DIF were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method.ResultsThe 216 study patients who underwent 332 SRS courses for 1456 BM imaged with MPRAGE and 3D-TSE (primary cohort) were compared to a control cohort (92 patients, 135 SRS courses, 462 BM). In the session-wise analysis, the median time to DIF between the cohorts was significantly prolonged in the primary vs. control cohorts (11.4 vs. 6.8 months, P = .029), more pronounced in the subgroups with 1–4 metastases (14.7 vs. 8.1 months, P = .008) and with solitary BM (36.4 vs. 10.9 months, P = .001). While patients relapsing on immunotherapy or targeted therapy did not significantly benefit from 3D-TSE (7.2 vs. 5.7 months, P = .280), those who relapsed on chemotherapy or who were off systemic therapy (including synchronous metastases) exhibited a trend toward longer time to DIF with 3D-TSE integration (14.7 vs. 7.9 months, P = .057).ConclusionsImplementing 3D-TSE sequences into SRS practice increases BM detection across all patients and translates into clinical relevance by prolonging time to DIF, particularly in those with limited intracranial disease and those not receiving central nervous system-active agents.",0
"IntroductionCirculating tumor cells are a promising biomarker in many malignancies. CTC dissemination during the operative procedure can lead to disease recurrence. The effect of preoperative transarterial embolization on the release of CTCs and miRNA panels and oncological outcomes in large hepatocellular carcinomas has been evaluated.Materials and methodsThe study included non-metastatic HCC >5 cm in size, that were completely resected after TAE (n = 10). Blood was collected pre-TAE, post-TAE, postoperative (day 2,30 and 180) and analyzed for the presence of CTC and miRNA (miR-885-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-642b-5p). The samples were subjected to CTC enrichment, isolation and staining using the markers CD45, EpCAM, and cytokeratin (CK). The data was analyzed using Gene Expression Suite software.ResultsThe CTC enumeration resulted in three groups: Group 1- CTC present at both pre-TAE and postoperative day 30 (n = 4), Group 2- CTC present at pre-TAE and clearing at postoperative day 30 (n = 2), Group 3- No CTC detected at any stages (n = 3). Group 2 patients had better survival compared with the other groups. Downregulation of miRNA 22-3p also had favorable prognostic implications.ConclusionAlthough preoperative TAE does not seem to impact CTC shedding, CTC clearance may prove to be a valuable biomarker in prognosticating HCC. A larger study to evaluate the significance of CTCs as a prognostic marker is warranted to further evaluate these findings.","AbstractThe aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role of circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection in the surgical assessment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with thrombi.Nine patients diagnosed with renal mass and thrombi were enrolled from June 2018 to January 2019. Blood samples were collected for CTC detection using SE-iFISH assay. CD45, DAPI, programmed death ligand 1, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with the centromere of chromosome 8 (CEP8) were immune-stained for analysis. Patient demographics, clinical features, pathological characteristics, and CTC detection results were extracted for analysis.Seven of 9 patients (77.8%) had 12 detectable CTCs, 5 of which were with CEP8-positive signal ≥5 and the others were CEP8-positive signal = 3. All 3 patients (100%) with IVC invasion had detectable CTCs, whereas CTCs were detected in 4 of 6 patients (66.7%) without IVC invasion. CEP8 analysis revealed that CTCs in IVC invasion patients were all of CEP8-positive signal ≥5 status, whereas only half of the CTCs in patients without IVC invasion were of CEP8-positive signal ≥5 pattern.In conclusion, both CTC subtype and total CTC number may serve as a marker for predicting inferior vena cava invasion in RCC patients.",1
"AbstractBACKGROUNDRecent advances in neuro-oncology highlighted the meninges as an important immunological hub at the crossroads between systemic immunity and the central nervous system. Meningiomas are predominantly benign tumors arising from meningeal cells. However, about 20% are high-grade cases, commonly refractory to standard treatment, showing high recurrence rates. Methylation-based classification has crucially improved meningioma patient stratification. However, the biological processes that govern differences between these classes remain unknown. Here, we investigate the role of differential immune infiltration, cellular communities, and their spatial organization. In light of previously found differential immune infiltration across methylation classes, this study aims to spatially resolve the role of myeloid cells and study their influence on tumor progression and recurrence. MATERIAL AND METHODSWe deployed multiplexed ion beam imagining and spatial transcriptomics on a retrospective cohort with extensive clinical annotations. Analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data of a subset of patients (n=22), we delineated the expression of gene and protein markers that were used to design an antibody panel comprising 41 targets for cell-type identification, phenotypic and metabolic characterization at the protein level. Additionally, we curated a targeted gene panel for spatial transcriptomics to perform granular spatial analysis. An integration of histological, spatial transcriptomic, and protein layers provides a comprehensive multi-omics approach to studying spatial cellular interactions. RESULTSTranscriptional programs and cell populations observed in single-nuclei data were captured in the spatial context revealing differences in the myeloid compartment across meningioma methylation classes. In specific classes, myeloid cells constitute a significant part of the tumor bulk warranting further investigation into their phenotypic differences. Accordingly, our analyses revealed a distinct phenotypic macrophage landscape along disease progression. Furthermore, spatial profiling of the metabolic regulome displayed distinct niche formation within perivascular and tumor compartments. CONCLUSIONIn this study we confirm that macrophages undergo a phenotypic switch from more tolerogenic in low-grade to inflammatory in high-grade cases of meningioma. Correspondingly, specific phenotypic and metabolic features of myeloid and tumor cells contribute to tumor progressions. Considering the limited targeted therapy options and poor responses to immunotherapy in meningioma patients, we hope that our spatial multi-omics analysis may reveal recurrent infiltration patterns of phenotypically distinct cell types that could be informative of biological processes and predictive of disease outcome.","AbstractBreast cancer is the primary cause of cancer‐related death in women worldwide. Breast cancer subtypes are characterized by different gene expression patterns, which drive their prognostic factors and therapeutic options. Among them, triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the deadliest due to its aggressiveness, high rate of early recurrence and distant metastases, and limited therapeutic options. Despite the recent approval of monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) or its ligand (PD‐L1) for the treatment of TNBC patients with a locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic tumor expressing PD‐L1, their response rate is very modest. It is reported that polymeric nanoparticle (NP)‐based cancer vaccines, co‐entrapping tumor‐associated antigens, Toll‐like receptor ligands and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1 by dendritic cells, sensitized TNBC to the agonist immune checkpoint OX40, inhibiting tumor growth and increasing overall survival. This anti‐tumor immune‐mediated effect is also observed in a luminal type of mammary cancer similar to human disease. Therefore, these synergistic anticancer effects of αOX40 and the antigen‐specific adaptive immunity induced by nanovaccine‐mediated TGF‐β silencing may guide the development of novel combination regimens able to improve the response rate to this aggressive tumor.",0
"IntroductionThe best first-line treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child–Pugh (CP) class B remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to perform a real-world analysis on a large sample of patients with unresectable HCC with CP B treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Vs Lenvatinib.MethodsThe study population included patients affected by advanced (BCLC-C) or intermediate (BCLC-B) HCC patients not suitable for locoregional therapies from both the Western and Eastern world (Italy, Germany, Republic of Korea and Japan), who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or Lenvatinib as first-line treatment. All the study population presented a CP class of B. The primary endpoint of the study was the overall survival (OS) of CP B patients treated with Lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Survival curves were estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan–Meier. The role of stratification factors was analyzed with log-rank tests. Finally, an interaction test was performed for the main baseline clinical characteristics.Results217 CP B HCC patients were enrolled in the study: 65 (30%) received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, and 152 (70%) received lenvatinib. The mOS for patients receiving Lenvatinib was 13.8 months (95% CI: 11.6–16.0), compared to 8.2 months (95% CI 6.3–10.2) for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Vs Lenvatinib: HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.0, p = 0.0050). No statistically significant differences were highlighted in terms of mPFS. The multivariate analysis confirmed that patients receiving Lenvatinib as first-line treatment have a significantly longer OS compared to patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.29–3.25, p = 0.0023). By evaluating the cohort of patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, we found that Child B patients with ECOG PS 0, or BCLC B stage or ALBI grade 1 were those who had benefited from the treatment thus showing survival outcomes no significantly different compared to those receiving Lenvatinib.ConclusionThe present study suggests for the first time a major benefit from Lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in a large cohort of patients with CP B class HCC.","BackgroundThe efficacy of adding atezolizumab to the platinum doublet regimen for extensive disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) remains marginally limited.MethodsWe retrospectively assessed the real-world efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in addition to carboplatin and etoposide (EP + A), versus carboplatin and etoposide (EP) alone in previously untreated ED-SCLC patients.ResultsFrom a total of 99 patients, 46 were assigned to the EP + A group, and 53 to the EP group. No significant difference was observed in progression-free survival between the groups. However, the overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in the EP + A group (20.8 vs 12.1 months; HR: 0.52; p = 0.0127). Patients older than 70 years, male, with performance status 0–1, without liver metastasis, and low levels of C-reactive protein and neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, experienced longer OS in the EP + A group compared to the EP group.ConclusionThe addition of atezolizumab to the platinum doublet regimen significantly extended OS in ED-SCLC patients, particularly among certain subgroups, suggesting its potential value in personalized treatment strategies. Further investigation is warranted to validate these findings.",1
"PurposeLenvatinib is recommended as a first-line therapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination therapy with local therapy (LT) or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (PI) might improve the antitumor effect of lenvatinib. The objective of this study was to investigate the antitumor effect of lenvatinib-based combination therapies.MethodsThe study retrospectively analyzed 215 HCC patients who received lenvatinib therapy. The outcomes of patients treated with lenvatinib monotherapy as well as combination strategies were compared. Progression-free survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 was the primary endpoint, while PFS by mRECIST, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety were the secondary endpoints. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to overcome the bias of baseline characteristics.ResultsCompared with lenvatinib monotherapy, combination therapy prolonged PFS (by RECIST v1.1, 7.77 vs. 4.43 months, P = 0.045; by mRECIST, 6.97 vs. 5.27 months, P = 0.067). A higher ORR was also recorded in the combined-therapy group, according to both RECIST v1.1 (37 vs. 5%, P < 0.001) and mRECIST (53 vs. 11%, P < 0.001). Similar outcomes were obtained after PSM. Moreover, triple therapy (combined with both PI and LT) was significantly superior to dual therapy (combined with either PI or LT) in terms of better PFS according to RECIST v1.1 (8.90 vs. 6.43 months, P = 0.023). However, adverse events occurred in more patients receiving combined therapy and triple therapy. No difference was observed in OS between groups.ConclusionCombination therapies based on lenvatinib were associated with significantly better PFS and tumor response rates than lenvatinib monotherapy in HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04082-2.","PurposeImmunotherapy with programmed cell death 1/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the systemic treatment of solid tumors, including bladder cancer. Previous studies have shown that enhanced glycolysis, tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration, and TGF-β secretion in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are closely related to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor immunotherapy resistance. However, the potential mechanism of their interaction in bladder cancer has not been fully uncovered.MethodsBy coculturing bladder cancer cells and TAMs, we studied the relationship and interaction mechanism between tumor cell glycolysis, TAM functional remodeling, TGF-β positive feedback secretion, and PD-L1 mRNA m6A methylation in the bladder cancer microenvironment.ResultsBioinformatics analysis and IHC staining found a close correlation between tumor glycolysis, M2 TAM infiltration, and the prognosis of bladder cancer patients. In Vitro experiments demonstrated that bladder cancer cells could re-educate M2 TAMs through lactate and promote TGF-β secretion via the HIF-1α signaling pathway. Reciprocally, in vitro, and in vivo experiments validated that M2 TAMs could promote glycolysis in bladder cancer cells by TGF-β via the Smad2/3 signaling pathways. Furthermore, M2 TAMs could also promote CSCs and EMT of bladder cancer cells. More importantly, we found M2 TAMs enhance PD-L1 mRNA m6A methylation by promoting METLL3 expression in bladder cancer via the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway in the TME.ConclusionsOur study highlights a feed-forward loop based on aerobic glycolysis and TGF-β between M2 TAMs and bladder cancer cells, which may be a potential mechanism of malignant progression and immunotherapy resistance in bladder cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05164-5.",1
"Purpose:Myocardial infarction (MI) with subsequent inflammation is one of the most common heart conditions leading to progressive tissue damage. A reliable imaging marker to assess tissue viability after MI would help determine the risks and benefits of any intervention. In this study, we investigate whether a new mitochondria-targeted imaging agent, 18F-labeled 2’-deoxy-2’−18F-fluoro-9-β-d-arabinofuranosylguanine ([18F]F-AraG), a positron emission tomography (PET) agent developed for imaging activated T cells, is suitable for cardiac imaging and to test the myocardial viability after MI.Procedure:To test whether the myocardial [18F]-F-AraG signal is coming from cardiomyocytes or immune infiltrates, we compared cardiac signal in wild-type (WT) mice with that of T cell deficient Rag1 knockout (Rag1 KO) mice. We assessed the effect of dietary nucleotides on myocardial [18F]F-AraG uptake in normal heart by comparing [18F]F-AraG signals between mice fed with purified diet and those fed with purified diet supplemented with nucleotides. The myocardial viability was investigated in rodent model by imaging rat with [18F]F-AraG and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) before and after MI. All PET signals were quantified in terms of the percent injected dose per cc (%ID/cc). We also explored [18F]FDG signal variability and potential T cell infiltration into fibrotic area in the affected myocardium with H&E analysis.Results:The difference in %ID/cc for Rag1 KO and WT mice was not significant (p = ns) indicating that the [18F]F-AraG signal in the myocardium was primarily coming from cardiomyocytes. No difference in myocardial uptake was observed between [18F]F-AraG signals in mice fed with purified diet and with purified diet supplemented with nucleotides (p = ns). The [18F]FDG signals showed wider variability at different time points. Noticeable [18F]F-AraG signals were observed in the affected MI regions. There were T cells in the fibrotic area in the H&E analysis, but they did not constitute the predominant infiltrates.Conclusions:Our preliminary preclinical data show that [18F]F-AraG accumulates in cardiomyocytes indicating that it may be suitable for cardiac imaging and to evaluate the myocardial viability after MI.","Purpose:Myocardial infarction (MI) with subsequent inflammation is one of the most common heart conditions leading to progressive tissue damage.

"PurposeProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) are considered predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in cervical cancer. However, their expression in primary tumors and metastases does not always match affecting the course of treatment. We investigated the consistency of their expression in primary and matched recurrent/metastatic lesions from patients with cervical cancer.MethodsPrimary and matched recurrent/metastatic specimens from patients with recurrent cervical cancer (n = 194) were stained for PD-L1 and MMR (MLHI, MSH6, MSH2, and PMS2) using immunohistochemistry. The degree of consistency of PD-L1 and MMR expression in these lesions was analyzed.ResultsThe inconsistency rate of PD-L1 expression in primary and recurrent/metastatic lesions was 33.0%, and it varied between the recurrence sites. Positive PD-L1 rate in primary lesions was lower (15.4%) than that in recurrent/metastatic lesions (30.4%). The discordance rate of MMR expression between primary and recurrent/metastatic lesions was 4.1%.ConclusionWe conclude that to use PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy, analysis of both metastatic and primary lesions may be required. High consistency rate of MMR expression between primary and metastatic lesions suggests that testing primary lesions alone can be sufficient for guiding the course of therapy, thereby solving the difficulty of obtaining recurrent/metastatic specimens in clinic.","PurposeCervical cancer (CC) patients are more likely to develop second primary malignancies (SPMs) than general population. With the advancement in cancer therapy, CC patients are achieving long-term survival, leading SPMs to our attention. Our study aims to establish diagnostic and prognostic nomograms for CC patients with second primary malignancies (CCSPMs) to help make personalized follow-up plans and treatments.MethodsData of CCSPMs between 2000 and 2019 was extracted from SEER. The proportions and the median interval time of CCSPM onset were calculated. 11 related clinical characteristics, including age, race, marital status, grade, FIGO stage, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, were further explore. Logistic and Cox regressions were employed to predict risk factors for CCSPMs diagnosis. Finally, two nomograms were developed to predict the probability occurrence and prognosis of CCSPMs, respectively.ResultsFor diagnostic nomogram construction, 59,178 CC patients were randomly divided into training (n = 41,426) and validation cohorts (n = 17,752). For prognostic nomogram construction, 3527 CCSPMs patients were randomly divided into training (n = 2469) and validation cohorts (n = 1058). The diagnostic nomogram consisting of above 11 independent risk factors (all P < 0.05), had high accuracy (AUCtraining = 0.851 and AUCvalidating = 0.845). The prognostic nomogram integrated with eight independent prognostic factors such as treatments, FIGO stage and TNM stage performed well in predicting 5-year OS (AUCtraining = 0.835 and AUCvalidating = 0.837).ConclusionOur diagnostic and prognostic nomograms could facilitate clinicians to quantify individual SPMs risk and survival probabilities and optimize the surveillance recommendations and personalized clinical decision-making.",1
AbstractWe present the case of a 59-year-old Chinese man diagnosed with stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma who developed 2 suspicious lung lesions 5 years after follow-up. Pathological evaluation revealed 2 distinct types of cancer: lung adenocarcinoma in situ and clear cell renal carcinoma with lung metastasis. Lung tissue samples were sequenced using a panel of 1267 cancer-related genes. The analysis revealed completely different molecular profiles between the 2 lung lesions and similar clonal mutations in the superior lingular lobe and kidney. This indicates multiple metachronous primary tumors.,"PurposeThis study was designed to evaluate the role and expression of MEK5 signalling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and to determine the relevance of MEK5 and mTOR signalling in ccRCC.MethodsThe expression of MEK5 was compared between ccRCC and normal tissues using the ONCOMINE and TCGA databases. MEK5 expression was evaluated in 14 human ccRCC samples. CCK8, wound-healing, and clone formation assays were performed to examine the cell proliferation, migration, and clone formation abilities of ccRCC cells treated with MEK5 and the inhibitor BIX02189. Furthermore, Western blotting was performed to verify the regulation and influence of MEK5 on the mTOR signalling pathway. Finally, a murine subcutaneous tumour model was constructed, and the effect and safety of BIX02189 were evaluated in vivo.ResultsThe ONCOMINE and TCGA databases indicated that MEK5 expression in ccRCC was significantly higher than that in normal tissues, which was further confirmed in clinical specimens. MEK5 knockdown markedly inhibited ccRCC cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, whereas MEK5 overexpression resulted in the opposite results. Western blotting revealed that overexpression of MEK5 could further activate the mTOR signalling pathway. Moreover, the MEK5 inhibitor BIX02189 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, induced apoptosis, and effectively inhibited cell migration and clone formation. BIX02189 also showed an excellent antitumor effect and a favourable safety profile in murine models.ConclusionsMEK5 expression was aberrantly increased in ccRCC, which activated the mTOR signalling pathway and regulated cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and clone formation in ccRCC. Targeted inhibition of MEK5 represents a promising new strategy in patients with ccRCC.",1
"PurposeThe low objective response of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains a great challenge in advanced melanoma therapy. Interferon-alpha has been proven to be a promising combination regimen with ICI in a phase Ib/II trial. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of interferon-alpha 1b plus PD-1 monoantibody in a real-world Chinese metastatic melanoma cohort.MethodsProfiles of patients diagnosed with unresectable stage IV (AJCC 8th Edition) between December 1st, 2018 and February 28th, 2022 from the Department of Dermatology, Xijing Hospital were reviewed. All of them received the combination treatment of interferon-alpha 1b (600 μg every other day) plus PD-1 monoantibody (Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or Toripalimab 240 mg or Sintilimab 200 mg, every 3 weeks) for at least 12 weeks. The efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V1.1). The safety data were identified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) V.5.0.ResultsIn total, 70 patients were included. 50% were females. 52.9% were with ECOG performance status ≥ 1. The fraction of patients receiving Pembrolizumab, Toripalimab, and Sintilimab was 28.6%, 67.1%, and 4.3%, respectively. Acral and mucosal subtypes accounted for 48.6% and 20%. The median follow-up period is 15.1 months. The objective response rate was 32.8%. The median time of overall survival was 18 months (95% CI 14.2–21.8 months), and the median time of PFS was 5.2 months (95% CI 4.2–6.2 months). The incidence of adverse events (any grade) was 98.6%, but only 8.6% of cases experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions.ConclusionThe combination of interferon-alpha 1b and PD-1 monoantibody demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects and acceptable toxicity in Chinese metastatic melanoma patients with cutaneous, acral, and mucosal subtypes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04596-3.","PurposePediatric solid tumors are significantly different from adult tumors. Studies have revealed genomic aberrations in pediatric solid tumors, but these analyses were based on Western populations. Currently, it is not known to what extent the existing genomic findings represent differences in ethnic backgrounds. ExperimentalDesignWe retrospectively analyzed the basic clinical characteristics of the patients, including age, cancer type, and sex distribution, and further analyzed the somatic and germline mutations of cancer-related genes in a Chinese pediatric cohort. In addition, we investigated the clinical significance of genomic mutations on therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic, and preventive actions. ResultsOur study enrolled 318 pediatric patients, including 234 patients with CNS tumors and 84 patients with non-CNS tumors. Somatic mutation analysis showed that there were significant differences in mutation types between CNS tumors and non-CNS tumors. P/LP germline variants were identified in 8.49% of patients. In total, 42.8% patients prompted diagnostic, 37.7% patients prompted prognostic, 58.2% patients prompted therapeutic, and 8.5% patients prompted tumor-predisposing and preventive, and we found that genomic findings might improve clinical management.ConclusionsOur study is the first large-scale study to analyze the landscape of genetic mutations in pediatric patients with solid tumors in China. Genomic findings in CNS and non-CNS solid pediatric tumors provide evidence for the clinical classification and individualized treatment of pediatric tumors, and they will facilitate improvement of clinical management. Data presented in this study should serve as a reference to guide the future design of clinical trials.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04756-5.",0
"The present study reports the development of a novel nanoconjugate, NG-FACD, comprising a positively charged self-assembled nanogel (NG) derived from a peptide amphiphilic hydrogelator and a negatively charged folic acid-functionalized blue-emitting carbon dot (FACD), bound via electrostatic interactions. NG-FACD was developed to combine the advantages of the individual nanocarriers and overcome their drawbacks. The presence of folic acid enables NG-FACD to be successfully used in selective bioimaging and targeted combination therapy against folate receptor-positive (FR+) B16F10 over FR– cells. NG-FACD demonstrated improved riboflavin (RbF) and paclitaxel (PTX) loading compared to individual nanocarriers that made it ∼1.8- and 1.5-fold more cytotoxic toward FR+ B16F10 cells over RbF- and PTX-loaded individual nanocarriers. The concurrent presence of RbF and PTX on NG-FACD displayed ∼1.9–2.8-fold higher cytotoxicity than single drug-loaded individual nanocarriers and ∼3–4.5-fold higher cytotoxicity through RbF-mediated photodynamic therapy and PTX-induced chemotherapy in synergy compared to free drugs against FR+ B16F10 cells.","We employ a combination of accelerated molecular dynamics and machine learning to unravel how the dynamic characteristics of CBL-B and C–CBL confer their binding affinity and selectivity for ligands from subtle structural disparities within their binding pockets and dissociation pathways. Our predictive model of dissociation rate constants (koff) demonstrates a moderate correlation between predicted koff and experimental IC50 values, which is consistent with experimental koff and τ-random accelerated molecular dynamics (τRAMD) results. By employing a linear regression of dissociation trajectories, we identified key amino acids in binding pockets and along the dissociation paths responsible for activity and selectivity. These amino acids are statistically significant in achieving activity and selectivity and contribute to the primary structural discrepancies between CBL-B and C-CBL. Moreover, the binding free energies calculated from molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) highlight the ΔG difference between CBL-B and C-CBL. The koff prediction, together with the key amino acids, provides important guides for designing drugs with high selectivity.",1
"BackgroundCancer metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, underscoring the importance of understanding its underlying mechanisms. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly malignant type of cancer, was selected as our research model.Material and methodsWe aimed to develop high-metastatic cell lines using in vitro and in vivo selection strategies and identify critical metastasis-related genes through microarray analyses by comparing them with parental cells.ResultsOur results showed that the high-metastatic cell lines exhibited significantly stronger invasion abilities than parental cells. Microarray analyses identified cytidine deaminase (CDA), a gene associated with systemic chemotherapy resistance, as one of the overexpressed genes in the high-metastatic cells. Data analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program revealed that while CDA is downregulated in HCC, patients with high CDA expression tend to have poorer prognoses. Cell models confirmed that CDA overexpression enhances cell migration and invasion, whereas CDA knockdown inhibits these abilities. Investigating the key molecules involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we found that CDA overexpression increases the expression of fascin, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and snail while decreasing E-cadherin expression. Conversely, CDA knockdown produced opposite results. Additionally, we discovered that CDA regulates NF-κB signaling, which controls the expression of N-cadherin, thereby promoting the invasion capability of HCC cells.ConclusionsWe isolated highly metastatic cells and identified potential HCC metastasis-related genes. CDA promotes cell invasion by regulating EMT through the NF-κB pathway. Future studies are warranted to explore the potential of CDA as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic decision-making.","PurposeUveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular malignant tumor in adults. Due to the lack of effective treatments for metastatic UM, the survival of UM has not changed over the past 3 decades. Therefore, it is important to identify essential genes regulating the metastasis of UM.MethodsIn this study, a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in an orthotopic mouse model of UM was performed to identify the regulatory genes conferring the metastatic phenotype. Loss-of-function analyses were performed to explore the function of G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) in UM metastasis in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the function of GPS2 as a tumor suppressor in UM.ResultsAmong the highest-ranking genes, we found several validated tumor suppressors, such as SHPRH, GPS2, PRPH2, and hsa-mir-1229; GPS2 was chosen as the candidate gene for further studies. GPS2 was lower expressed in the tumor tissues of UM patients. Furthermore, knocking-down GPS2 promoted the proliferation and metastatic abilities of UM cells both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, analysis of the transcriptome data revealed that silencing GPS2 upregulates oncogenic signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K-Akt, and in the meantime downregulates tumor suppressor signaling pathway Slit/Robo in UM cells.ConclusionAltogether, our study proved that the GPS2 gene functions as a tumor suppressor and might be a novel potential therapeutic target for UM treatment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04160-5.",1
"Chronic systemic inflammation significantly increases myocardial infarction risk in people living with HIV (PLWH). Endothelial cell dysfunction disrupts vascular homeostasis regulation, increasing the risk of vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis, contributing to cardiovascular disease. We aimed to characterize endothelial cell (EC) chemokines, cytokine and chemokine receptors of PLWH, hypothesizing that in our cohort, glucose intolerance contributes to their differential expression implicated in endothelial dysfunction. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we phenotyped chemokine, chemokine, and cytokine receptor expression on arterial ECs, capillary ECs, venous ECs, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 59 PLWH with and without glucose intolerance. Our results show that arterial and capillary ECs express significantly higher interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors than venous ECs and VSMCs. Venous ECs exhibited more interleukin (IL)1R1 and ACKR1 receptors, and VSMCs showed significant IL6R expression than arterial and capillary ECs. When stratified by group, arterial ECs from PLWH with glucose intolerance expressed significantly higher IL1R1, IL6R, CXCL12, CCL14, and ICAM2 transcripts than arterial ECs from PLWH without diabetes. Of the different vascular cell types studied, arterial ECs as a proportion of all ECs in adipose tissue were positively correlated with plasma fasting blood glucose. In contrast, venous ECs and VSMCs were positively correlated with plasma IL6. To directly assess the effect of plasma from PLWH on endothelial function, we cultured human arterial ECs (HAECs) in plasma-conditioned media from PLWH and performed bulk RNA sequencing. Plasma from PLWH stimulated ECs with the upregulation of genes that enrich for the oxidative phosphorylation and the TNF-α via NFK-β pathways. In conclusion, ECs in PLWH show heterogeneous cytokine and chemokine receptor expression, and arterial ECs were the most influenced by glucose intolerance. Further research must explicate cytokine and chemokine roles in EC dysfunction and identify biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response.","ABSTRACTBackgroundBirch pollen (BP) interacts with airway epithelial cells to cause allergic sensitization and allergy in predisposed individuals. However, the basic mechanisms underlying the clinical effects are poorly understood. Changes in gene expression and cytokine secretion in nasal mucosal cells upon BP exposure were determined in BP‐allergic and non‐allergic individuals.MethodsBP‐allergic (n = 11) and non‐allergic individuals (n = 12) participated in nasal provocations with saline and aqueous BP solution. Nasal scrapings and secretions were obtained at baseline and after BP provocation. Bulk RNA sequencing of the nasal scrapings was performed, and cytokines in nasal secretions were quantified.ResultsAfter BP challenge, we identified 160 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the nasal scrapings of allergic individuals and 44 in non‐allergic individuals. DEGs encoding S100 proteins, keratins, small proline‐rich repeat proteins, and cytokines were predominantly identified, with proinflammatory cytokine transcripts being upregulated only in the allergic cohort. The top canonical pathways in allergic individuals included granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, wound healing, IL‐8 signaling, and IL‐17‐related pathways. Enriched pathways in allergic participants were associated with granulocyte chemotaxis, humoral cell responses, and IL‐10, IL‐4, and IL‐13 signaling and were absent in non‐allergic individuals. At baseline and after BP challenge, higher amounts of CCL17, CCL20, CCL26, IL‐7, IL‐16, and IL‐33 were detected in nasal secretions of allergic compared to non‐allergic individuals.ConclusionOur results highlight the activation of important cellular signaling pathways specific to BP‐allergic individuals after BP exposure offering new perspectives for studying key players in BP allergy.",1
"BackgroundThere are limited studies on the association between angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) and the predictive risk of melanoma, even though angiogenic factors, which are essential for tumor growth and metastasis, might be secreted by angiogenesis-related protein in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). To forecast patient outcomes, this study attempts to develop a predictive risk signature linked to angiogenesis in cutaneous melanoma.MethodsIn 650 patients with SKCM, the expression and mutation of ARGs were examined, and this information was related to the clinical prognosis. SKCM patients were split into two groups based on how well they performed on the ARG. The link between ARGs, risk genes, and immunological microenvironment was examined using a range of algorithmic analysis techniques. Based on these five risk genes, an angiogenesis risk signature was created. We developed a nomogram and examined the sensitivity of antineoplastic medications to help the proposed risk model's clinical applicability.ResultsThe risk model developed by ARGs revealed that the prognosis for the two groups was significantly different. The predictive risk score was negatively connected with memory B cells, activated memory CD4 + T cells, M1 macrophages, and CD8 + T cells, and favorably correlated with dendritic cells, mast cells, and neutrophils.ConclusionsOur findings offer fresh perspectives on prognostic evaluation and imply that ARG modulation is implicated in SKCM. Potential medications for the treatment of individuals with various SKCM subtypes were predicted by drug sensitivity analysis.

One example is that white blood cells can sense and move to the site of pathogen attack within minutes. The robustness and precision of cellular functions have been perfected through billions of years of evolution. In this context, we ask the question whether cells follow a set of physical principles to sense, adapt, and migrate. Microfluidics has emerged as an enabling technology for recreating well-defined cellular environment for cell migration studies, and its ability to follow single cell dynamics allows for the results to be amenable for theoretical modeling. In this review, we focus on the development of microfluidic platforms for recreating cellular biophysical (for example, mechanical stress) and biochemical (for example, nutrients and cytokines) environments for cell migration studies in 3D. We summarize the basic principles that cells (including bacteria, algal, and mammalian cells) use to respond to chemical gradients learned from microfluidic systems. We also discuss about novel biological insights gained from studies of cell migration under biophysical cues and the need for further quantitative studies of cell function under well-controlled biophysical environments in the future.",0
"There is evidence from numerous studies that dysbiosis of the microbiome provokes various immune-mediated diseases, obesity, diabetes, and cancers by regulating metabolites, host genetics, environmental elements, and stress. Such reports are yet to define an accurate regulatory network for host-gut microbiome communication. miRNAs have recently emerged as crucial mediators of this communication, as portrayed by their interaction with the host microbiome. This mini-review summarizes the bi-direction effects between miRNA and microbiome and elucidates their role in carcinogenesis. An in-depth understanding of the association of miRNA with host-microbiome could be valuable to improve cancer remission, diagnosis, and treatment, and may help to potential tumor markers.","Pancreatic cancer is a significant public health concern, with increasing incidence rates and limited treatment options. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, in the development and progression of this disease. Microbial dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota, has been implicated in pancreatic carcinogenesis through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances. Researchers have identified specific microbial signatures associated with pancreatic cancer, offering potential biomarkers for early detection and prognostication. By leveraging advanced sequencing and bioinformatics tools, scientists have delineated differences in the gut microbiota between pancreatic cancer patients and healthy individuals, providing insights into disease pathogenesis and potential diagnostic strategies. Moreover, the microbiome holds promise as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer treatment. Interventions aimed at modulating the microbiome, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have demonstrated potential in enhancing the efficacy of existing cancer therapies, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These approaches can influence immune responses, alter tumor microenvironments, and sensitize tumors to treatment, offering new avenues for improving patient outcomes and overcoming therapeutic resistance. Overall, understanding the complex interplay between the microbiome and pancreatic cancer is crucial for advancing our knowledge of disease mechanisms and identifying innovative therapeutic strategies. Here we report phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA microbial sequences of the pancreatic cancer mice microbiome and corresponding age matched healthy mice microbiome. We successfully identified differentially abundant microbiota in pancreatic cancer.",1

We assessed the spatial accessibility of vaccination sites and analyzed predictors of vaccine uptake.METHODS:In this cross-sectional study of pediatric COVID-19 vaccinations from the US Vaccine Tracking System as of July 29, 2022, we described spatial accessibility by geocoding vaccination sites, measuring travel times from each Census tract population center to the nearest site, and weighting tracts by their population demographics to obtain nationally representative estimates. We used quasi-Poisson regressions to calculate incidence rate ratios, comparing vaccine uptake between counties with highest and lowest quartile Social Vulnerability Index scores: socioeconomic status (SES), household composition and disability (HCD), minority status and language (MSL), and housing type and transportation.RESULTS:We analyzed 15 233 956 doses administered across 27 526 sites. Rural, uninsured, white, and Native American populations experienced longer travel times to the nearest site than urban, insured, Hispanic, Black, and Asian American populations. Overall Social Vulnerability Index, SES, and HCD were associated with decreased vaccine uptake among children aged 6 months to 4 years (overall: incidence rate ratio 0.70 [95% confidence interval 0.60–0.81]; SES: 0.66 [0.58–0.75]; HCD: 0.38 [0.33–0.44]) and 5 years to 11 years (overall: 0.85 [0.77–0.95]; SES: 0.71 [0.65–0.78]; HCD: 0.67 [0.61–0.74]), whereas social vulnerability by MSL was associated with increased uptake (6 months–4 years: 5.16 [3.59–7.42]; 5 years–11 years: 1.73 [1.44–2.08]).CONCLUSIONS:Pediatric COVID-19 vaccine uptake and accessibility differed by race, rurality, and social vulnerability. National supply data, spatial accessibility measurement, and place-based vulnerability indices can be applied throughout public health resource allocation, surveillance, and research.",0
"ABSTRACTD2 surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy has been established as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer in Asian countries. However, its efficacy is still unsatisfactory, especially for pathological N3 disease. The RACING trial is a randomized, multicenter, Phase III trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy in combination with PD-1 inhibitor and radiotherapy in patients with pN3 gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. A total of 433 patients will be assigned at a 1:1 ratio to the two arms. The primary end point is the 3-year disease-free survival rate. The secondary end points include the 3-year overall survival rate, 3-year local recurrence-free survival rate, treatment-related adverse events and quality of life.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT04997837 (ClinicalTrials.gov)","AbstractLarge type 3 and type 4 gastric cancers (GC) have a significantly poor prognosis, primarily due to their high predisposition for peritoneal dissemination. The application of intraperitoneal chemotherapy has emerged as a viable therapeutic strategy for managing GC patients with peritoneal metastasis. This study is planned to enroll 37 resectable large type 3 or type 4 GC patients. These patients are scheduled to undergo a treatment comprising preoperative chemotherapy with paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and S-1, followed by D2 gastrectomy, and concluding with postoperative treatments that include prophylactic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The study’s primary objective is to evaluate the 3-year peritoneal recurrence rate. Secondary objectives are to assess the 3-year disease-free survival, 3-year overall survival and to monitor the adverse events.Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR2400083253 (",1
"AbstractBackgroundPancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review synthesises all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making. It updates the previous version of the review, published in 2018.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both on overall survival, severe or life‐threatening adverse events, and quality of life in people undergoing first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.Search methodsWe searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CANCERLIT, and handsearched various sources for additional studies. The latest search dates were in March and July 2023.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both with another intervention or best supportive care. Participants were required to have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer not amenable to curative intent treatment. Histological confirmation was required. Trials were required to report overall survival.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.Main resultsWe included 75 studies in the review and 51 in the meta‐analysis (11,333 participants). We divided the studies into seven categories: any anti‐cancer treatment versus best supportive care; various chemotherapy types versus gemcitabine; gemcitabine‐based combinations versus gemcitabine alone; various chemotherapy combinations versus gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel; fluoropyrimidine‐based studies; miscellaneous studies; and radiotherapy studies. In general, the included studies were at low risk for random sequence generation, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias, at unclear risk for allocation concealment, and high risk for performance bias.Compared to best supportive care, chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.33; absolute risk of death at 12 months of 971 per 1000 versus 962 per 1000; 4 studies, 298 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The adverse effects of chemotherapy and impacts on quality of life (QoL) were uncertain. Many of the chemotherapy regimens were outdated.Eight studies compared non‐gemcitabine‐based chemotherapy regimens to gemcitabine. These showed that 5‐fluorouracil (5FU) likely reduces OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27; risk of death at 12 months of 914 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 1 study, 126 participants; moderate certainty), and grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). Fixed dose rate gemcitabine likely improves OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; risk of death at 12 months of 683 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 644 participants; moderate certainty), and likely increase grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). FOLFIRINOX improves OS (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60; risk of death at 12 months of 524 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 652 participants; high certainty), and delays deterioration in QoL, but increases grade 3/4 adverse events.Twenty‐eight studies compared gemcitabine‐based combinations to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine plus platinum may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; risk of death at 12 months of 745 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 6 studies, 1140 participants; low certainty), may increase grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely worsens QoL. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improves OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; risk of death at 12 months of 722 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 10 studies, 2718 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely improves QoL. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitors result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; risk of death at 12 months of 770 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 3 studies, 839 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely does not alter QoL. Gemcitabine plus taxane result in a large improvement in OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; risk of death at 12 months of 644 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 986 participants; high certainty), and likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events and improves QoL.Nine studies compared chemotherapy combinations to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combination regimens improve OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; risk of death at 12 months of 542 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 6 studies, 1285 participants; high certainty). The treatment arms had distinct toxicity profiles, and there was little to no difference in QoL. Alternative schedules of gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel likely result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.47; risk of death at 12 months of 663 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 2 studies, 367 participants; moderate certainty) or QoL, but may increase grade 3/4 adverse events.Four studies compared fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations to fluoropyrimidines alone, with poor quality evidence. Fluoropyrimidine‐based combinations are likely to result in little to no impact on OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.15; risk of death at 12 months of 765 per 1000 versus 704 per 1000; P = 0.27; 4 studies, 491 participants; moderate certainty) versus fluoropyrimidines alone. The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in grade 3/4 adverse events or QoL between the two groups.We included only one radiotherapy (iodine‐125 brachytherapy) study with 165 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of radiotherapy on outcomes.Authors' conclusionsCombination chemotherapy remains standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus a taxane improve OS compared to gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that fluoropyrimidine‐based combination chemotherapy regimens improve OS compared to gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel. The effects of radiotherapy were uncertain as only one low‐quality trial was included. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individuals still remains unpersonalised, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to assist in rationalising treatment selection for patients.","The present study reports the development of a novel nanoconjugate, NG-FACD, comprising a positively charged self-assembled nanogel (NG) derived from a peptide amphiphilic hydrogelator and a negatively charged folic acid-functionalized blue-emitting carbon dot (FACD), bound via electrostatic interactions. NG-FACD was developed to combine the advantages of the individual nanocarriers and overcome their drawbacks. The presence of folic acid enables NG-FACD to be successfully used in selective bioimaging and targeted combination therapy against folate receptor-positive (FR+) B16F10 over FR– cells. NG-FACD demonstrated improved riboflavin (RbF) and paclitaxel (PTX) loading compared to individual nanocarriers that made it ∼1.8- and 1.5-fold more cytotoxic toward FR+ B16F10 cells over RbF- and PTX-loaded individual nanocarriers. The concurrent presence of RbF and PTX on NG-FACD displayed ∼1.9–2.8-fold higher cytotoxicity than single drug-loaded individual nanocarriers and ∼3–4.5-fold higher cytotoxicity through RbF-mediated photodynamic therapy and PTX-induced chemotherapy in synergy compared to free drugs against FR+ B16F10 cells.",1
"ABSTRACTCholesterol serves as a vital lipid that regulates numerous physiological processes. Nonetheless, its role in regulating cell death processes remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of cholesterol trafficking in immunogenic cell death. Through cell-based drug screening, we identified two antidepressants, sertraline and indatraline, as potent inducers of the nuclear translocation of TFEB (transcription factor EB). Activation of TFEB was mediated through the autophagy-independent lipidation of MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3). Both compounds promoted cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes, resulting in lysosomal membrane permeabilization, disruption of autophagy and cell death that could be reversed by cholesterol depletion. Molecular docking analysis indicated that sertraline and indatraline have the potential to inhibit cholesterol binding to the lysosomal cholesterol transporters, NPC1 (NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1) and NPC2. This inhibitory effect might be further enhanced by the upregulation of NPC1 and NPC2 expression by TFEB. Both antidepressants also upregulated PLA2G15 (phospholipase A2 group XV), an enzyme that elevates lysosomal cholesterol. In cancer cells, sertraline and indatraline elicited immunogenic cell death, converting dying cells into prophylactic vaccines that were able to confer protection against tumor growth in mice. In a therapeutic setting, a single dose of each compound was sufficient to significantly reduce the outgrowth of established tumors in a T-cell-dependent manner. These results identify sertraline and indatraline as immunostimulatory agents for cancer treatment. More generally, this research shed light on novel therapeutic avenues harnessing lysosomal cholesterol transport to regulate immunogenic cell death.Abbreviation: ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG13: autophagy related 13; DKO: double knockout; ICD: immunogenic cell death; KO: knockout; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; LGALS3: galectin 3; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; LMP: lysosomal membrane permeabilization; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MTX: mitoxantrone; NPC1: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1; NPC2: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2; TFE3: transcription factor E3; TFEB: transcription factor EB; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.","BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological cancer driven on by aberrant myeloid precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. A prognostic model was created in this study to direct therapeutic care.MethodsDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were investigated using the RNA-seq data from the TCGA-LAML and GTEx. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) examines the genes involved in cancer. Find the intersection genes and construct the PPI network to discover hub genes and remove prognosis-related genes. A nomogram was produced for predicting the prognosis of AML patients using the risk prognosis model that was constructed using COX and Lasso regression analysis. GO, KEGG, and ssGSEA analysis were used to look into its biological function. TIDE score predicts immunotherapy response.ResultsDifferentially expressed gene analysis revealed 1004 genes, WGCNA analysis revealed 19,575 tumor-related genes, and 941 intersection genes in total. Twelve prognostic genes were found using the PPI network and prognostic analysis. To build a risk rating model, RPS3A and PSMA2 were examined using COX and Lasso regression analysis. The risk score was used to divide the patients into two groups, and Kaplan–Meier analysis indicated that the two groups had different overall survival rates. Univariate and multivariate COX studies demonstrated that risk score is an independent prognostic factor. According to the TIDE study, the immunotherapy response was better in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group.ConclusionsWe eventually selected out two molecules to construct prediction models that might be used as biomarkers for predicting AML immunotherapy and prognosis.",0
"Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3) is a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein family expressed in the extracellular matrix closely associated with the development and occurrence of various malignant tumors; yet, its function in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is still poorly understood. The following study investigated the progress and mechanism of HAPLN3 on ccRCC using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments. In order to determine whether HAPLN3 is differentially expressed in ccRCC, we analyzed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE40435 and further validated them in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Simultaneously, the TCGA dataset was utilized to study the relationship between HAPLN3 expression and the progression of ccRCC and its prognostic value in ccRCC. Gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore HAPLN3-related signaling pathways in ccRCC. The TIMER database investigates the link for both HAPLN3 and immune cell infiltration. Different ccRCC cell lines the role of HAPLN3 on cell biological behavior in vitro. HAPLN3 was increased in ccRCC, and its high expression was related to the patients' survival rates and clinical characteristics. GSEA showed that HAPLN3 is mainly enriched in proliferative and metastatic pathways. In addition, HAPLN3 was an independently associated significant predictor in patients with ccRCC. Functional experiments demonstrated that HAPLN3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. To sum up, our data suggest that HAPLN3 may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.","ABSTRACTAkkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is a ‘star strain’ that has attracted much attention in recent years. A. muciniphila can effectively regulate host metabolism, significantly affect host immune function, and play an important role in balancing host health and disease. As one of the organs most closely related to the gut (the two can communicate through the hepatic portal vein and bile duct system), liver is widely affected by intestinal microorganisms. A growing body of evidence suggests that A. muciniphila may alleviate liver-related diseases by improving the intestinal barrier, energy metabolism and regulating inflammation through its protein components and metabolites. This paper systematically reviews the key roles of A. muciniphila and its derivatives in maintaining liver health and improving liver disease.",0
"AbstractType-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complicated long-term disorder associated with metabolism that is identified by insulin resistance, imbalance in glucose regulation and reduced secretion of insulin. GLP-1(Glucagon-like peptide-1) is an incretin mimetic that has excellent effects on the regulation of blood glucose levels and also the management of disorders associated with vital organs. GLP-1 agonist is an effective class of drug for the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus and associated complications. Liraglutide is one of the potent drugs of this class having similar effects as biological GLP-1. This review includes clinical trials and patents related to the pharmaceutical formulation, synthesis and biological action of liraglutide.","AbstractPathogens can be involved in tumor initiation, promotion, and progression through different mechanisms, and their treatment can prevent new cancer cases, improve outcomes, and revert poor‐prognostic phenotypes. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) successfully treats different types of cancers and infections and, therefore, has a unique potential to address their combination. However, we believe this potential has been underutilized, and few researchers have investigated the impacts of PDT of both infection‐related and cancer‐related outcomes at once. This review presents the main agents behind cancer‐associated infections (CAIs), the PDT protocols that have been tested on them, and their key findings. Additionally, we discuss the key aspects of PDT that make it ideal for CAI treatment, and what knowledge gaps need to be filled in order to make it successful.",0
"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to compare response rates of lenvatinib and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, in first-line real-world setting.MethodsOverall cohort included Western and Eastern hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient populations from 46 centres in 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Japan, and Republic of Korea).Results1312 patients were treated with lenvatinib, and 823 patients were treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Objective response rate (ORR) was 38.6% for patients receiving lenvatinib, and 27.3% for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p < 0.01; odds ratio 0.60). For patients who achieved complete response (CR), overall survival (OS) was not reached in both arms, but the result from univariate Cox regression model showed 62% reduction of death risk for patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (p = 0.05). In all multivariate analyses, treatment arm was not found to be an independent factor conditioning OS. Comparing ORR achieved in the two arms, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of lenvatinib compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in all subgroups except for Eastern patients, Child–Pugh B patients, presence of portal vein thrombosis, α-feto-protein ≥ 400 ng/mL, presence of extrahepatic disease, albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2, and no previous locoregional procedures.ConclusionLenvatinib achieves higher ORR in all patient subgroups. Patients who achieve CR with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab can achieve OS so far never recorded in HCC patients. This study did not highlight any factors that could identify patient subgroups capable of obtaining CR.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04512-1.","PurposeLenvatinib is recommended as a first-line therapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination therapy with local therapy (LT) or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (PI) might improve the antitumor effect of lenvatinib. The objective of this study was to investigate the antitumor effect of lenvatinib-based combination therapies.MethodsThe study retrospectively analyzed 215 HCC patients who received lenvatinib therapy. The outcomes of patients treated with lenvatinib monotherapy as well as combination strategies were compared. Progression-free survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 was the primary endpoint, while PFS by mRECIST, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety were the secondary endpoints. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to overcome the bias of baseline characteristics.ResultsCompared with lenvatinib monotherapy, combination therapy prolonged PFS (by RECIST v1.1, 7.77 vs. 4.43 months, P = 0.045; by mRECIST, 6.97 vs. 5.27 months, P = 0.067). A higher ORR was also recorded in the combined-therapy group, according to both RECIST v1.1 (37 vs. 5%, P < 0.001) and mRECIST (53 vs. 11%, P < 0.001). Similar outcomes were obtained after PSM. Moreover, triple therapy (combined with both PI and LT) was significantly superior to dual therapy (combined with either PI or LT) in terms of better PFS according to RECIST v1.1 (8.90 vs. 6.43 months, P = 0.023). However, adverse events occurred in more patients receiving combined therapy and triple therapy. No difference was observed in OS between groups.ConclusionCombination therapies based on lenvatinib were associated with significantly better PFS and tumor response rates than lenvatinib monotherapy in HCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04082-2.",1
"AbstractBackgroundAlterations in forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), a pioneer transcription factor, are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and prostate cancer. We characterized FOXA1 genomic alterations and their clinical impacts in a large pan-cancer cohort from the American Association for Cancer Research Genomics, Evidence, Neoplasia, Information, Exchange database.Methods FOXA1 alterations were characterized across more than 87 000 samples from more than 30 cancer types for primary and metastatic tumors alongside patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. FOXA1 alterations were queried in the Memorial Sloan Kettering - Metastatic Events and Tropisms (MSK-MET) cohort (a GENIE subset), allowing definition of hazard ratios (HRs) and survival estimates based on Cox proportional hazard models.Results FOXA1 was altered in 1869 (2.1%) samples, with distinct patterns across different cancers: prostate cancer enriched with indel-inframe alterations, breast cancer with missense mutations, and lung cancers with copy number amplifications. Of 74 715 samples with FOXA1 copy number profiles, amplification was detected in 834 (1.1%). Amplification was most common in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 3% in primary; 6% in metastatic) and small cell lung cancer (4.1% primary; 3.5% metastatic), followed by breast cancer (2% primary; 1.6% metastatic) and prostate cancer (2.2% primary; 1.6% metastatic). Copy number amplifications were associated with decreased overall survival in NSCLC (HR = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 1.99; P = .02), breast cancer (HR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.89 to 4.89; P = 4e−6), and prostate cancer (HR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.03 to 3.68; P = .04). Amplifications were associated with widespread metastases in NSCLC, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.Conclusions FOXA1 demonstrates distinct alteration profiles across cancer sites. Our findings suggest an association between FOXA1 amplification and enhanced metastatic potential and decreased survival, highlighting prognostic and therapeutic potential in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and NSCLC.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) significantly burdens global healthcare systems given limited treatment options to delay or stop disease progression. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, an immunotherapeutic approach that has produced remarkably effective responses in cancer, offers a potential avenue for the treatment of AD. Here, we discuss three significant challenges of adapting CAR-T cell therapy for AD: (i) identifying a suitable antigen target; (ii) limited permeability of the blood–brain barrier; and (iii) long-term persistence and durability of manufactured CAR-T cell products. Potential strategies to overcome these hurdles provide an attractive opportunity to revolutionize the treatment for AD and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders.",0
"Purpose: T cell-based immunotherapy, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, has emerged as an appropriate approach for treating hematologic malignancies and is currently under investigation in clinical trials for solid tumors. Despite significant improvements in CAR-T cell production processes, the isolation and expansion of CAR-engineered T cells continue to pose significant challenges. The aim of this research is to provide a simple and cost-effective method for the isolation and expansion of human CAR-T cells. This novel concept applies coated fetal bovine serum (FBS) culture plates and focuses on enhancing viability and functionality to improve the adherence of suspended T cells. Methods: This study evaluated a two-dimensional (2D) culture technique for isolating the CAR-T cells that target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) utilizing matrices pre-coated with 0.2% glutaraldehyde and FBS. Jurkat cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the anti-PSMA CAR construct. FBS-coated and commercialized Matrigel-coated matrices were used for single-cell isolation and clonal expansion. Functional tests were conducted to assess the activation and proliferation of CAR-T cells and the IFN-γ release assay subsequent to cloning and expansion. Results: Transfection efficiency markedly improved, with 88.4% of Lenti-X 293T cells demonstrating green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Among the Jurkat cells, 57.1% showed GFP expression post-transduction, of which 34.1% showed surface expression of anti-PSMA CAR. Clonal expansion on the FBS-coated matrix proved effective, yielding 92.1% GFP-positive isolated cells. Functional assays demonstrated that CAR-T cells co-cultured with LNCaP cells exhibited significantly enhanced proliferation, activation (as indicated by CD69 and CD25 expression), and cytokine release assay (IFN-γ) compared with those co-cultured with DU 145 and mock cells.Conclusion: This new approach is efficient, economical, and scalable for isolating specific homogenous T cells and promoting their clonal proliferation and expansion. Furthermore, this method improves T cell adherence, proliferation, and functional effectiveness, offering a potential foundation for advancing CAR-T cell therapies aimed at solid tumors. Future research should concentrate on optimizing culture conditions and testing this method in preclinical animal models to ensure its clinical applicability and efficacy.","PurposeColon cancer is highly heterogeneous in terms of the immune and stromal microenvironment, genomic integrity, and oncogenic properties; therefore, molecular subtypes of the four characteristic dimensions are expected to provide novel clues for immunotherapy of colon cancer.MethodsAccording to the enrichment of four dimensions, we performed consensus cluster analysis and identified three robust molecular subtypes for colon cancer, namely immune enriched, immune deficiency, and stroma enriched. We characterized and validated the immune infiltration, gene mutations, copy number variants, methylation, protein expression, and clinical features in different datasets. Finally, we developed an 8-gene risk prognostic model and proposed the innovative RiskScore. In addition, a nomogram model was constructed combining clinical characteristics and RiskScore to validate its excellent clinical predictive power.ResultsCombining clinical patient tissue samples and histochemical microarray data, we found that high FMOD expression in tumor epithelial cells was associated with poorer patient prognosis, but FMOD expression in the mesenchyme was not associated with prognosis. In pan-cancer, RiskScore, a prognostic model constructed based on characteristic pathway scores, was a poor prognostic factor for malignancy and was negatively associated with immunotherapy response.ConclusionThe identification of molecular subtypes could provide innovative ideas for immunotherapy of colon cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05163-6.",1
"Collagen contributes to extracellular matrix formation and stiffness, providing a three-dimensional framework that supports the development and growth of solid tumors. By interacting with specific tumor cell receptors, collagen influences tumor cell signaling pathways, promoting cancer progression and drug resistance. Recent advancements in understanding the tumor extracellular matrix have underscored collagen's role in fostering an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and acting as a barrier to immunotherapy. Understanding the immunosuppressive mechanisms of collagen in the TME has revealed novel therapeutic targets and opportunities. This review highlights the immunoregulatory functions of collagen in the TME and provides a comprehensive overview of integrating collagen scores with traditional immunoscore-based immunotyping methods to enhance response prediction. Additionally, we discuss recent therapeutic developments in collagen targeting and their clinical potential for enhancing anti-cancer immunity.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical health concern in Korea, ranking as the second leading cause of cancer mortality and imposing substantial economic burdens, particularly among the working-age population. This review examines recent advancements in treating advanced HCC, referencing the updated 2022 HCC guidelines and the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer system. Historically, first-line systemic therapies included sorafenib and lenvatinib, with regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab serving as second-line options. Since 2020, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown superior overall survival than sorafenib, leading to the adoption of combination therapies such as atezolizumab with bevacizumab and durvalumab with tremelimumab as first-line treatments. The IMbrave150 study demonstrated that atezolizumab–bevacizumab significantly extended median overall survival and progression-free survival, with the longest survival reported in any phase 3 trial for advanced HCC. Similarly, the HIMALAYA study indicated that durvalumab combined with tremelimumab significantly improved survival rates. Second-line therapies now include regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, nivolumab with ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab, each offering benefits for specific patient populations. Nonetheless, these therapies are associated with side effects that require careful management. Traditional targeted therapies can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular events, and hand-foot skin reactions, whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors may cause immune-related adverse events affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system. Clinicians must be well-versed in these treatments and their potential side effects to provide optimal patient care. The emergence of combination therapies targeting complex biological pathways signifies a new paradigm in HCC treatment, emphasizing the importance of continuous education and vigilant monitoring to optimize patient outcomes.",1
"The growing use of adjuvants in the fast-paced formulation of new vaccines has created an unprecedented need for meaningful analytical assays that deliver reliable quantitative data from complex adjuvant and adjuvant–antigen mixtures. Due to their complex chemical and physical properties, method development for the separation of vaccine adjuvants is considered a highly challenging and laborious task. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is among the most important tests in the (bio)pharmaceutical industry for release and stability indicating measurements including adjuvant content, identity, and purity profile. However, the time constraints of developing “on-demand” robust quantitative methods prior to each change in formulation can easily lead to sample analysis becoming a bottleneck in vaccine development. Herein, a simple and efficient generic analytical framework capable of chromatographically resolving the most commonly used non-aluminum-based adjuvants across academic and industrial sectors is introduced. This was designed to seek a more proactive approach for fast-paced assay development endeavors that evolved from extensive stationary phase screening in conjunction with multifactorial in silico simulations of adjuvant retention time (RT) as a function of gradient time, temperature, organic modifier blending, and buffer concentration. The multifactorial retention models yield 3D resolution maps with excellent baseline separation of all adjuvants in a single run, which was found to be very accurate, with differences between experimental and simulated retention times of less than 1%. The analytical framework described here also includes the introduction of a more versatile approach to method development by introducing a dynamic RT database for adjuvants covering the entire library of adjuvants with broad mechanisms of action across numerous vaccine formulations with excellent linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity. The power of this framework was also demonstrated with numerous analytical assays that can be generated rapidly from simulations guiding vaccine processes in the development of new adjuvant formulations. Analytical assay in this work covers content, purity profile by LC with diode array detector (DAD) and charged aerosol detector (CAD), and component identification by LC with mass spectrometry (MS) across complex vaccine formulations, including the use of surfactants (for example, polysorbates) as well as their separation from adjuvant targets.","Despite advances in neuroscience, limited progress has been made in developing new and better medications for psychiatric disorders. Available treatments in psychiatry rely on a few classes of drugs that have a broad spectrum of activity across disorders with limited understanding of mechanism of action. While the added value of more targeted therapies is apparent, a dearth of pathophysiologic mechanisms exists to support targeted treatments, and where mechanisms have been identified and drugs developed, results have been disappointing. Based on serendipity and early successes that led to the current drug armamentarium, a haunting legacy endures that new drugs should align with outdated and overinclusive diagnostic categories, consistent with the idea that “one size fits all”. This legacy has fostered clinical trial designs focused on heterogenous populations of patients with a single diagnosis and non-specific outcome variables. Disturbingly, this approach likely contributed to missed opportunities for drugs targeting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and now inflammation. Indeed, cause-and-effect data support the role of inflammatory processes in neurotransmitter alterations that disrupt specific neurocircuits and related behaviors. This pathway to pathology occurs across disorders and warrants clinical trial designs that enrich for patients with increased inflammation and use primary outcome variables associated with specific effects of inflammation on brain and behavior. Nevertheless, such trial designs have not been routinely employed, and results of anti-inflammatory treatments have been underwhelming. Thus, to accelerate development of targeted therapeutics including in the area of inflammation, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry must embrace treatments and trials focused on pathophysiologic pathways that impact specific symptom domains in subsets of patients, agnostic to diagnosis. Moreover, closer collaboration among basic and clinical investigators is needed to apply neuroscience knowledge to reveal disease mechanisms that drive psychiatric symptoms. Together, these efforts will support targeted treatments, ultimately leading to new and better therapeutics in psychiatry.",0
"ABSTRACTLung cancer is a leading cause of global cancer mortality, often treated with chemotherapeutic agents. However, conventional approaches such as oral or intravenous administration of drugs yield low bioavailability and adverse effects. Nanotechnology has unlocked new gateways for delivering medicine to their target sites. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) are one of the nano-scaled delivery platforms that have been studied to exploit advantages of liposomes and polymers, enhancing stability, drug loading, biocompatibility and controlled release. Pulmonary administration of drug-loaded LPHNPs enables direct lung deposition, rapid onset of action and heightened efficacy at low doses of drugs. In this manuscript, we will review the potential of LPHNPs in management of lung cancer through pulmonary administration.","Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is a novel chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer. Although rashes are reported as a common adverse event from this therapy, a paucity of literature is available on dermatologic toxicities to EV, especially with respect to bullous dermatoses. This case report will review a unique bullous dermatosis in the setting of EV therapy, including the diagnostic workup and management. Because cutaneous adverse events to chemotherapy and immunotherapy are common and can often result in dose reduction and treatment withdrawal for cancer patients, awareness of these manifestations and understanding how to manage them is crucial to providing quality care to this patient population.",0
"Pathological hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of microtubule-associated Tau protein contribute to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other related tauopathies. Currently, no cure exists for Alzheimer’s Disease. Aptamers offer significant potential as next-generation therapeutics in biotechnology and the treatment of neurological disorders. Traditional aptamer selection methods for Tau protein focus on binding affinity rather than interference with pathological Tau. In this study, we developed a new selection strategy to enrich DNA aptamers that bind to surviving monomeric Tau protein under conditions that would typically promote Tau aggregation. Employing this approach, we identified a set of aptamer candidates. Notably, BW1c demonstrates a high binding affinity (Kd = 6.6 nM) to Tau protein and effectively inhibits arachidonic acid (AA)-induced Tau protein oligomerization and aggregation. Additionally, it inhibits GSK3β-mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation in cell-free systems and okadaic acid-mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation in cellular milieu. Lastly, retro-orbital injection of BW1c tau aptamer shows the ability to cross the blood brain barrier and gain access to neuronal cell body. Through further refinement and development, these Tau aptamers may pave the way for a first-in-class neurotherapeutic to mitigate tauopathy-associated neurodegenerative disorders.","IntroductionImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and has generated remarkable clinical results against multiple malignancies. Exploration of new technical approaches to further boost the therapeutic efficacy of ICB is of potential medical importance. In this study, we designed a novel nanotherapeutics for ICB immunotherapy.MethodsCTLA-4 aptamers were conjugated to the surface of albumin nanoparticle to construct an aptamer-modified nanostructure (Apt-NP). To improve ICB efficacy, fexofenadine (FEXO), an antihistamine, was encapsulated into Apt-NP to make a drug-loaded nanoparticle (Apt-NP-FEXO). The antitumor efficacies of Apt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsApt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO had average diameters of 149 nm and 159 nm, respectively. Similar to free CTLA-4 aptamers, Apt-modified NPs could selectively bind with CTLA-4 positive cells and improve lymphocyte-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity in vitro. In animal studies, compared with free CTLA-4 aptamer, Apt-NP significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Moreover, Apt-NP-FEXO further improved antitumor efficacy vs. Apt-NP in vivo.ConclusionThe results suggest that Apt-NP-FEXO represents a novel strategy to improve ICB outcome and may have application potential in cancer immunotherapy.",1
"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to investigate and analyze the level of actual participation and perceived importance of shared decision-making on treatment and care of lung cancer patients, to compare their differences and to explore their influencing factors.MethodsA total of 290 lung cancer patients were collected from oncology and thoracic surgery departments of a comprehensive medical center in Qingdao from October 2018 to December 2019. Participants completed a cross-sectional questionnaire to assess their actual participation and perceived importance in shared decision-making on treatment and care. Descriptive analysis and non-parametric tests were carried out to assess the status quo of patients' shared decision-making on treatment and care. Binary logistic regression analysis with a stepwise back-wards was applied to predict factors that affected patients' participation in shared decision-making.ResultsThe results showed that patients with lung cancer had a low degree of participation in shared decision-making. There were significant differences between actual participation and perceived importance of shared decision-making on treatment and care. Education level, age, gender, income, marital status, personality, the course of the disease (> 6 months), and the pathological TNM staging (III) affected patient's level of participation in shared decision-making.ConclusionActual participation in shared decision-making on the treatment and care of lung cancer patients was low and considered unimportant. We could train oncology nurses to use patient decision aids to help patients and families participate in shared decision-making on patients’ value, preferences and needs.","AbstractBACKGROUNDImmunotherapy (IT) has gained increased significance as a systemic therapy option in the management of various types of metastatic cancer, including cases involving brain metastases (BMs). The differential diagnosis of progressive/relapsed BMs and treatment-related changes (TRC) is often based on imaging with amino acid (AA) PET, in addition to standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as this has been established to provide higher diagnostic accuracy. However, diagnostic value of the AA-PET in the context of IT has not been studied so far. In this pilot study we quantified diagnostic accuracy of AA PET in patients with suspected progressive BMs under IT. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis retrospective study included patients with suspected progressive/relapsed BMs on MRI after radiotherapy (RT) between 04/2007 - 01/2023. Only patients with AA PET ≤ 4 weeks prior to surgery/biopsy of BMs were selected. AA PET results were compared with histopathological findings and distinctive features were highlighted. RESULTSOut of 29 patients, 7 were treated with IT (IT+ group). Remaining patients (IT- group) were treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, a combination of both, or obtained no systemic therapy before PET. The groups did not differ regarding age, gender, initial number of BMs or time interval between PET and last RT. In the IT+ group, 6 patients had malignant melanoma and 1 patient urothelial carcinoma as primary tumor. The IT+ patients obtained ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab, sequentially, or in combination. In the IT+ and IT- group, 7 and 21 PET scans were read as suspicious for progressive/relapsed BMs, respectively. The rate of false-positive findings was 5/7 (71.4%) and 3/21 (14.3%), respectively (chi square test, p=0.008). Histopathological analyses revealed an inflammatory reaction with lymphocytic infiltrates in the examined tissue in the IT+ group. CONCLUSIONThere is a significantly higher rate of false-positive AA PET findings in patients with BMs who have been treated with IT. This observation may be explained by an immunologically mediated inflammatory reaction. Further immunological analyses of lymphocytic infiltrates could provide more information.In conclusion, until more data are available, caution should be exercised when diagnosing tumor recurrence using AA PET in patients who have previously received IT.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDReplication-repair deficiency (RRD) stemming from mismatch repair and polymerase proofreading gene defects (MMRD/PPD) lead to hypermutant childhood cancers, most frequently brain tumors. While medulloblastoma is reported, the clinical, genomic and immune landscape remains unknown. METHODSWe analysed the genome, methylome, transcriptome (bulk, single-nuclei) and immune-microenvironment of the largest cohort of RRD-medulloblastoma patients enrolled by the International RRD Consortium and correlated these to clinical outcomes. RRD mice-models were used to preclinically assess response to immunotherapy. Results: RESULTSRRD-medulloblastoma (n=43) were enriched for anaplasia (61%) and localised disease (77%). Methylation/nano-string-based subgrouping failed to classify 40%, while the remaining clustered with the SHH-subgroup. Copy-number changes were notably infrequent (<20%). All tumors harboured hypermutation and microsatellite instability in contrast to non-RRD controls (p<0.0001). Pathogenic variants were frequent in POLE/POLD1 (80%), TP53 (48%) and SHH-pathway genes (PTCH1, SUFU, SMO: 56%). Interestingly, some tumors additionally had glioma-driver alterations (ATRX, NF1: ~50%), similar to RRD cerebellar glioblastoma, but distinct from both non-RRD medulloblastoma (n=791) and hemispheric glioblastoma (n=733) controls. Moreover, although bulk-transcriptome matched non-RRD SHH medulloblastoma, single-nuclei analyses suggested an earlier cell-of-origin potentially explaining the heterogenous phenotypes resulting from the driver mutations. Uniquely, immune analyses (gene expression and immunohistochemistry) demonstrated high intra-tumoral CD8 T-cell infiltration. Three-year progression-free survival was 60%. Outcome was worse for RRD-medulloblastoma harbouring TP53-mutation (p=0.04) and failing subgroup-classification (p=0.004). Nestin/Cre MSH2-/- POLE;p.S459F mice developing medulloblastoma recapitulated human disease and demonstrated response to anti-PD1 monotherapy. Recurrent/progressive human tumors including those harbouring TP53-mutations exhibited radiological responses to anti-PD1 monotherapy, which was associated with prolonged ongoing survival in comparison to those not treated with checkpoint-inhibitors (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONSHypermutant RRD-medulloblastoma reveal heterogenous phenotypes due to unique spectrum of driver mutations and an early cell of origin. Their immune-hot microenvironment allows successful salvage treatment with checkpoint-inhibitors for those failing chemo-radiation, including the high-risk SHH/TP53-mutant and unclassified subgroups.","Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer (BC) depends on the recognition of bacteria by extracellular toll-like receptors (TLRs) or the detection of mycobacterial DNA by endosomal TLRs or the cGAS-STING pathway. Agonists related to these innate immune pathways have been developed as adjuvants to potentiate the effects of immunotherapy. As innate immune pathways are important for the action of BCG and other agonists proposed for BC therapy, we decided to investigate the presence of mutations in the main receptors of these pathways. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was screened to identify BC-related mutations (apart from oncogenes), targeting, in particular, TLRs, the adaptor molecule MyD88, and the cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes) immune pathway. Among 1,724 BC entries, 103 mutations were identified in 80 affected cases in the cohort. TLR9 and TLR10 ranked among the most frequent mutated genes observed in the affected cases in our search (13 mutations each). Through all analyzed data, the search for MYD88 gene recovered only 1 mutation input in the database. Mutations in the STING and cGAS genes were found in one and four cases, respectively. We also evaluated clinical data, including the pathologic stage of BC, and gene expression from 103 mutations entries. This article attempts to highlight the relevance of mutations in genes coding for innate immune molecules in BC samples as potential biomarkers to predict individual disease outcome, and specifically to help find the appropriate treatment for each person in the future.",0
"Pancreatic cancer is a significant public health concern, with increasing incidence rates and limited treatment options. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, in the development and progression of this disease. Microbial dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota, has been implicated in pancreatic carcinogenesis through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances. Researchers have identified specific microbial signatures associated with pancreatic cancer, offering potential biomarkers for early detection and prognostication. By leveraging advanced sequencing and bioinformatics tools, scientists have delineated differences in the gut microbiota between pancreatic cancer patients and healthy individuals, providing insights into disease pathogenesis and potential diagnostic strategies. Moreover, the microbiome holds promise as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer treatment. Interventions aimed at modulating the microbiome, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have demonstrated potential in enhancing the efficacy of existing cancer therapies, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. These approaches can influence immune responses, alter tumor microenvironments, and sensitize tumors to treatment, offering new avenues for improving patient outcomes and overcoming therapeutic resistance. Overall, understanding the complex interplay between the microbiome and pancreatic cancer is crucial for advancing our knowledge of disease mechanisms and identifying innovative therapeutic strategies. Here we report phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA microbial sequences of the pancreatic cancer mice microbiome and corresponding age matched healthy mice microbiome. We successfully identified differentially abundant microbiota in pancreatic cancer.","AbstractThe interaction between Tim‐3 on T cell and its ligand, Galectin‐9, negatively regulates cellular immune responses. However, the role of Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 pathway in the immune evasion of cervical cancer remains unknown. This study is to investigate the expression, function, and regulation of Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 signaling pathway in human papilloma virus (HPV) positive cervical cancer. Flow cytometry showed that Tim‐3 expression on T cell and Galectin‐9 expression on monocytes in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly higher compared to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and benign uterine fibroids Tim‐3 + CD4+ Th1 cells and Tim‐3 + CD8+ T cells in HPV positive cervical cancer patients were significantly reduced after surgery. Serum TGF‐β and IL‐10 levels were positively correlated with Tim‐3 + Treg cells, while IFN‐γ and IL‐2 were negatively correlated with Tim‐3 + Th1 cells. Additionally, Tim‐3 + CD4+ T cells were positively correlated with Galectin‐9 + monocytes. Survival curve analysis showed that Tim‐3 + CD4+ T cells were negatively correlated with patient survival, and closely related to FIGO stage, degree of differentiation, and lymph node metastasis of HPV positive cervical cancer. In vitro experiments showed that by blocking the Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 pathway, the proliferation of T cells and their ability to express IFN‐γ, IL‐2, perforin, and granzyme B was significantly restored. In conclusion, high levels of Tim‐3 and Galectin‐9 in HPV positive cervical cancer patients play roles in the progression of disease by promoting Treg cells to inhibit the cytotoxic function of Th1 and CD8+ T cells. Tim‐3/Galectin‐9 may serve as a new immunotherapy target for patients with HPV positive cervical cancer.",0
"SummaryThe mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) family of chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in regulating DNA accessibility and gene expression. The three final-form subcomplexes – cBAF, PBAF, and ncBAF— are distinct in biochemical componentry, chromatin targeting, and roles in disease, however the contributions of their constituent subunits to gene expression remain incompletely defined. Here, we performed Perturb-seq-based CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens targeting mSWI/SNF subunits individually and in select combinations, followed by single-cell RNA-seq and SHARE-Seq. We uncovered complex-, module-, and subunit-specific contributions to distinct regulatory networks, and defined paralog subunit relationships and shifted subcomplex functions upon perturbations. Synergistic, intra-complex genetic interactions between subunits reveal functional redundancy and modularity. Importantly, single-cell subunit perturbation signatures mapped across bulk primary human tumor expression profiles both mirror and predict cBAF loss-of-function status in cancer. Our findings highlight the utility of Perturb-Seq to dissect disease-relevant gene regulatory impacts of heterogeneous, multi-component master regulatory complexes.","AbstractIrreversible electroporation (IRE) is a minimally invasive ablation technique that compromises integrity of the cell membrane through the application of short duration, high voltage electric pulses to induce cell death. Adverse effects of IRE such as muscle contractions are reduced with higher frequency biphasic pulsing, commonly known as high-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE). IRE and H-FIRE treatments have shown to increase immune activation through the induction of both immediate and delayed cell death, indicated by the release of damage-associated molecular pathways, antigens, and proteins. In this study, we demonstrated that specific modes of cell death can be elicited by modifying the applied pulse width and electric field strength of various waveforms. Several assays were performed on a human glioblastoma cell line, seeded onto a 2D monolayer for electroporation treatments. Cleavage of Caspase 3/7 and Caspase 1, well-known indicators of apoptosis and pyroptosis, respectively, was quantified. Our results indicate that apoptotic activity was increased for shorter pulse widths and stronger electric fields, whereas pyroptotic activity displayed opposite trends being significantly dominant with longer pulse widths at lower applied electric fields. When clinically applied, the activation of specific cell death mechanisms can allow for controlling the extent of an electroporation-mediated immune response and subsequently improved overall patient survival. With this information, we could use an electrode array to spatially manipulate the elicited immune response for patient-specific treatments.",0
"ObjectivesThe aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with recurrent and metastatic sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and evaluate the current treatment strategies to help guide future management.DesignThis is a retrospective cohort study.SettingThe study was conducted at six international tertiary treatment centers.ParticipantsPatients with documented diagnoses of recurrent or metastatic SNUC since 1983 were included in the study.Main Outcome MeasuresPatient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected. Primary outcome measures included disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), and time to recurrence (TTR) following initial treatment. Further univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess for prognostic factors.Results A total of 97 patients with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 52.4 (15.6) were identified, 15 of whom presented with metastatic SNUC and 90 of whom developed recurrence. Management in both populations was widely variable. For patients with metastatic disease, the 1-year DSS probability was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8–100%). For patients with recurrent SNUC, the 1- and 5-year DSS probabilities were 45.7% (95% CI, 31.9–65.6%) and 8.6% (95% CI, 2.9–25.3%), respectively. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) TTR was 8 months (3–18.5 months). Multivariable analyses revealed a significant association between orbital involvement on initial presentation and TTR (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.28; 95% CI, 1.45–7.42; p = 0.004). ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study addressing metastatic and recurrent SNUC based on a large patient cohort. Orbital extension of the primary SNUC may predict a higher probability of recurrence following treatment, suggesting the possible utility of a more aggressive treatment in this subgroup of patients. A heterogenous patient population and wide variability in management emphasize the challenges in standardizing care; however, dismal survival rates demonstrate the necessity for further evaluation of current approaches to improve evidence-based recommendations.","AbstractInverted papillomas (IP) are rare sinonasal tumors (Schneiderian papillomas) characterized by local invasion, with high recurrence rates and potential for malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC ex‐IP). Traditionally, the mainstay of treatment has been surgical resection, often challenging due to invasion of the skull base or vital neurovascular structures. In advanced cases, prognosis is poorer and radiation therapy is the current standard of care with limited role of systemic therapy. We present a case of unresectable SCC ex‐IP treated with sequential chemoradiation and PD‐1 immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and achieving complete response at 1 year. This case suggests that immunotherapy can effectively treat SCC ex‐IP and we propose that programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) testing should be performed in all advanced cases. Prospective studies are needed to validate immunotherapy in adjuvant or frontline treatments for advanced SCC ex‐IP, and the role of PD‐L1 as a predictive biomarker.",1
"AbstractOvarian cancer (OC), with its high mortality rate among gynecological cancers, is often diagnosed late due to the lack of early diagnostic symptoms and biomarkers. The tumor immune microenvironment has become a focal point in cancer diagnostic and therapeutic research. Among these, B7-H4, a checkpoint protein, plays a crucial role in immune regulation and tumor suppression, contributing to immune evasion within the tumor microenvironment. This study aims to identify the concentration of soluble B7-H4(sB7-H4) in the plasma of patients with OC and to evaluate its clinical significance. Through a comprehensive analysis involving enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and multicolor immunofluorescence, we quantified sB7-H4 levels in patient plasma and ascites, correlating these findings with tissue expression and clinical outcomes. Results indicated a strong association between high sB7-H4 levels and advanced disease, surgical outcomes, lymphatic metastasis, and platinum resistance. When compared with traditional biomarkers CA125 and HE4, sB7-H4, especially in conjunction with these markers, enhances the diagnostic accuracy for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), offering insights into disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. This comprehensive analysis suggests that sB7-H4 is a promising biomarker for EOC, providing valuable insights into diagnosis, stage differentiation, treatment effectiveness, and prognosis.","Glioma is the primary malignant tumor with the highest incidence rate in the adult central nervous system. The application of bioinformatics methods to analyze the RNA sequences of multiple gliomas revealed that the CDT1 gene has a significant impact on the cell cycle of glioma cells. Subsequently, we comprehensively and systematically investigated the expression of CDT1 in gliomas through bioinformatics analysis, clinical tissue specimens, and in vitro functional experiments. Our study is the first to report the expression of CDT1 in glioma. Our findings demonstrate that CDT1 plays a crucial role in the proliferation and invasion of glioma. Additionally, our bioinformatics analysis identified several other genes and signaling pathways that are dysregulated in multifocal gliomas, providing potential targets for further research and drug development.",1

VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in mCRC in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in patients without liver metastases. The TKI zanzalintinib (XL092) targets VEGFR, MET and TAM kinases, proteins that are involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. Zanzalintinib has immunomodulatory properties that may enhance response to ICIs. Presented is the design of STELLAR-303, a global, phase III, open-label, randomized study evaluating zanzalintinib plus atezolizumab versus regorafenib in patients with non-MSI-H mCRC who progressed during/after or are refractory/intolerant to standard-of-care therapy. The primary end point is overall survival in patients without liver metastases.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05425940 (ClinicalTrials.gov)",0
"AbstractBackgroundSex differences in adult diffuse glioma (ADG) are well established clinically, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Here, we aim to reveal molecular features and cellular compositions unique to each sex in ADG to comprehend the role of sex in disease etiology.MethodsWe quantified sex differences in the transcriptome of ADG using multiple independent glioma patient datasets. Next, we delved into the single-cell landscape to examine sex differences in gene expression and cellular composition. To explore how sex influences disease progression, we analyzed paired samples from primary and recurrent ADG cases, aiming to identify sex-specific differences in molecular and cellular features.ResultsOur analysis revealed that mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes and the tumor microenvironment emerged as primary influencers of sex-differential molecular enrichments. In IDHwt tumors, genes in the neuronal signaling pathway are found to be enriched in male tumors, while genes in hypoxia and inflammatory response pathways are enriched in female tumors. This pattern was reversed in IDHmut gliomas. We hypothesized that these distinctions could be attributed to heterogeneous cellular composition between sexes. Using single-cell data, we observed distinctive patterns of sex differences in cell states, cell composition, and cell–cell interaction in IDHwt and IDHmut tumors separately. Further, by comparing molecular changes in paired primary and recurrent ADG samples, we identified sex-specific differences in molecular characteristics and cellular compositions of recurrent tumors.ConclusionsOur results provide a comprehensive multilevel characterization of sex differences in ADG; such findings provide novel insights into glioma disease progression in each sex.","AbstractBackgroundAcquired resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy due to DNA mismatch repair (MMR) enzyme deficiency is a barrier to improving outcomes for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) patients. KL-50 is a new imidazotetrazine-based therapeutic designed to induce DNA interstrand cross-links, and subsequent double-stranded breaks, in an MMR-independent manner in cells with O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) deficiency. Previous research showed its efficacy against LN229 glioma cells with MMR and MGMT knockdown. Its activity against patient-derived GBM that model post-TMZ recurrent tumors is unclear.MethodsWe created MMR-deficient GBM patient-derived xenografts through exposure to TMZ, followed by treatment with additional TMZ or KL-50. We also generated isogenic, MSH6 knockout (KO) patient-derived GBM and tested them for sensitivity to TMZ and KL-50.ResultsKL-50 extended the median survival of mice intracranially engrafted with either patient-derived TMZ-naïve GBM6 or TMZ-naïve GBM12 by 1.75-fold and 2.15-fold, respectively (P < 0.0001). A low dose (4 Gy) of fractionated RT further extended the survival of KL-50-treated GBM12 mice (median survival = 80 days for RT + KL-50 vs. 71 days KL-50 alone, P = 0.018). KL-50 also extended the median survival of mice engrafted with post-TMZ, MMR-deficient GBM6R-m185 (140 days for KL-50 vs. 37 days for vehicle, P < 0.0001). MSH6 KO increased TMZ IC50 for GBM6 and GBM12 cultures by >5-fold and >12-fold for cell death and live cell count outputs, respectively. In contrast, MSH6-KO actually decreased KL-50 IC50 by 10–80%.ConclusionKL-50-based compounds are a promising new strategy for the treatment of MGMT-deficient, MMR-deficient GBM that recurs after frontline TMZ.",1
"Introduction:The accurate assessment of nodal (N) status is crucial to the management and prognostication of non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We sought to determine whether the current N descriptors should be maintained or revised for the upcoming 9th edition of the international Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) lung cancer staging system.Methods:Data was assembled by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer on patients with non-small cell lung cancer, detailing both clinical and pathologic N status, with information about anatomic location and individual station-level identification. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic groups were assessed by a Cox regression analysis.Results:Data for clinical N and pathologic N status were available in 45,032 and 35,009 patients, respectively. The current N0 to N3 descriptors for both clinical N and pathologic N categories demonstrated prognostically distinct groups. Furthermore, single station N2 involvement (N2a) demonstrated better prognosis than multistation N2 involvement (N2b) in both clinical and pathologic classifications, and the differences between all neighboring nodal subcategories were highly significant. The prognostic differences between N2a and N2b were robust and consistent across resection status, histologic type, T category, and geographic region.Conclusions:The current N descriptors should be maintained, with the addition of new sub-descriptors to N2 for single station involvement (N2a) and multiple station involvement (N2b).","Purpose:Low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer is a chronic illness commonly treated by repetitive transurethral resection of bladder tumor. We compared the efficacy and safety of intravesical chemoablation with UGN-102 (a reverse thermal gel containing mitomycin), with or without subsequent transurethral resection of bladder tumor, to transurethral resection of bladder tumor alone in patients with low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.Materials and Methods:This prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial recruited patients with new or recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer to receive initial treatment with either UGN-102 once weekly for 6 weeks or transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Patients were followed quarterly by endoscopy, cytology, and for-cause biopsy. The primary end point was disease-free survival. All patients were followed for adverse events.Results:Trial enrollment was halted by the sponsor to pursue an alternative development strategy after 282 of a planned 632 patients were randomized to UGN-102 ± subsequent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (n=142) or transurethral resection of bladder tumor monotherapy (n=140), rendering the trial underpowered to perform hypothesis testing. Patients were predominantly male and ≥65 years of age. Tumor-free complete response 3 months after initial treatment was achieved by 92 patients (65%) who received UGN-102 and 89 patients (64%) treated by transurethral resection of bladder tumor. The estimated probability of disease-free survival 15 months after randomization was 72% for UGN-102 ± transurethral resection of bladder tumor and 50% for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (hazard ratio 0.45). The most common adverse events (incidence ≥10%) in the UGN-102 group were dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and pollakiuria.Conclusions:Primary, nonsurgical chemoablation with UGN-102 for the management of low-grade intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer offers a potential therapeutic alternative to immediate transurethral resection of bladder tumor monotherapy and warrants further investigation.",0
"PurposeEmerging evidence suggests that pyroptosis plays an essential role in the development and progression of multiple cancers. However, the role of pyroptosis remains elusive in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).MethodsThe expression profile data of DLBCL and normal samples of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) were analyzed, and the clinical characteristics of DLBCL patients were further investigated. A prognostic model was established using LASSO-Cox regression analysis. The expression of these PRGs was validated by qRT-PCR in DLBCL cell lines. Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry were utilized to explore the impact of pyroptosis inhibitor (disulfiram, DSF) combined with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor (BMS1166) on DLBCL cell proliferation.ResultsMost PRGs were dysregulated in DLBCL samples and associated with overall survival (OS). Six PRGs were selected to construct a prognostic risk score model. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that CASP8, CASP9, NLRP1, NLRP6, and TIRAP are downregulated, while SCAF11 was significantly upregulated in DLBCL cell lines. This prognostic model divided DLBCL patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited lower mortality and longer OS than those in the high-risk group. The ROC curve and nomogram demonstrated this model's excellent predictive performance. GO and KEGG enrichment indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between subgroups were associated with cellular protein modification processes and JAK-STAT signaling pathway regulation. Moreover, the risk score was correlated with the immune profile. Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry further validated the synergistic anti-tumor effects of DSF and BMS1166 on DLBCL cells.ConclusionIn summary, we developed a comprehensive prognostic model based on PRGs characteristics, which accurately predicted the prognosis of DLBCL patients. Pyroptosis-targeting coupled with immunotherapies would be a promising therapeutic strategy for DLBCL.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05018-0.","AbstractBackgroundSuper-enhancers (SEs) typically govern the expression of critical oncogenes and play a fundamental role in the initiation and progression of cancer. Focusing on genes that are abnormally regulated by SE in cancer may be a new strategy for understanding pathogenesis. In the context of this investigation, we have identified a previously unreported SE-driven gene IRF2BP2 in neuroblastoma (NB).MethodsThe expression and prognostic value of IRF2BP2 were detected in public databases and clinical samples. The effect of IRF2BP2 on NB cell growth and apoptosis was evaluated through in vivo and in vitro functional loss experiments. The molecular mechanism of IRF2BP2 was investigated by the study of chromatin regulatory regions and transcriptome sequencing.ResultsThe sustained high expression of IRF2BP2 results from the activation of a novel SE established by NB master transcription factors MYCN, MEIS2, and HAND2, and they form a new complex that regulates the gene network associated with the proliferation of NB cell populations. We also observed a significant enrichment of the AP-1 family at the binding sites of IRF2BP2. Remarkably, within NB cells, AP-1 plays a pivotal role in shaping the chromatin accessibility landscape, thereby exposing the binding site for IRF2BP2. This orchestrated action enables AP-1 and IRF2BP2 to collaboratively stimulate the expression of the NB susceptibility gene ALK, thereby upholding the highly proliferative phenotype characteristic of NB.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that SE-driven IRF2BP2 can bind to AP-1 to maintain the survival of tumor cells via regulating chromatin accessibility of the NB susceptibility gene ALK.",0
"PurposeTo compare the toxicity and clinical efficacy of TL (docetaxel + lobaplatin) induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy and TPF (docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy combined with cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Methods and patientsIn total, 128 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled between August 2016 and April 2021. They were randomly divided into trial group and control group, all using chronological dosage mode. The trial group used TL regimen induction chemotherapy combined with lobaplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy; the control group used TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The endpoints were adverse events and survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years.ResultsMedian follow-up was 42 months (20–71 months).  Adverse events: During induction chemotherapy, compared with TPF group, grade 3–4 leukocytes and neutrophils, diarrhea, 1–2 hyperbilirubinemia, nausea / vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, anorexia, hyponatremia were significantly lower in TL group (p<0. 05): 6% vs. 35%, 14% vs. 53%, 0% vs. 6%, 15% vs. 40%, 9% vs. 56%, 0% vs. 10%, 3% vs. 13%, 2% vs. 23%, 15% vs. 74%. During chemoradiotherapy, the incidence of hyponatremia, hypokalaemia and grade 1–2 nausea was significantly lower in the TL group (p<0. 05), with 24% vs. 69%, 20% vs. 65% and 24% vs. 44%, respectively. However, more grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia were observed in the TL group (15% vs. 3%, p<0. 05).  There was no significant difference in the recent objective response rate (ORR) between patients with TL group and TPF group (p=0.961).  There was no statistical difference in 1, 3 and 5 years OS between TL group and TPF group, respectively, (71.0% vs. 67.5%, p=0.573), (56.6% vs. 56.9%, p=0.814), (52.5% vs. 52.9%, p=0.841); 1, 3 and 5 years PFS are: (63.4% vs. 64.0%, p=0.883), (51.1% vs. 54.0%, p=0.705) and (47.3% vs. 45.9%, p=0.887), None of them were significantly different. Multivariate analysis of COX regression showed that T stage (p=0.01) and surgery (p=0.046) were independent factors affecting PFS and OS, respectively. OS subgroup analysis shows that people receiving the TL regimen in postoperative and nodal stage N1 and N2 patients tended to survive longer than those receiving the TPF regimen.ConclusionPatients with postoperative, N1 or N2 stage locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may have more significant clinical benefits when treated with TL regimen. TL regimen has advantages in reducing toxic side effects and can be used as one of the first-line treatment options.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03117257).","BackgroundWe evaluate outcomes of SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinomas in the largest single-institution study.MethodsRetrospective cross-sectional study of patients with SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma between 1998 and 2024. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free probability (RFP) at 1 and 5 years were measured by Kaplan-Meier method.ResultsThere were 47 patients with a median age of 53. Initial pathological diagnosis was altered in 33%. Twelve (34%) patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with one partial response. Curative surgical approach was undertaken in 73%. Definitive chemoradiation was administered in 20%. DSS at 1 and 5 years was 93% and 45%, respectively. RFP at 1 and 5 years was 73% and 33%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, cranial nerve involvement (p=0.01 for DSS) remained significantly worse for DSS and overall survival.ConclusionsSMARCB1-deficient tumors had limited response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cranial nerve involvement was associated with worse prognosis. Optimal treatment is unclear. Surgery should be offered to patients with resectable disease.",1
"AbstractRationaleHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.ObjectivesTo evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.Eligibility criteriaParallel‐group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross‐over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi‐randomised trials for analysis.OutcomesOur critical outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non‐serious.Risk of biasWe assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.Synthesis methodsWe used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta‐analysed the outcome data at the longest follow‐up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random‐effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.Included studiesWe included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single‐centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia‐Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co‐interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information.The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow‐up was three months to five years.Synthesis of resultsTen trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions.Eight trials evaluated all‐cause mortality at varied follow‐up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow‐up periods taken together.The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one‐year follow‐up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events.One trial measured health‐related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow‐up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health‐related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health‐related quality of life scores. No further data were provided.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Tamoxifen versus control interventions (that is no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non‐serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non‐serious.We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.We identified no ongoing trials.Authors' conclusionsBased on the low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all‐cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events considered non‐serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.FundingThis Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.RegistrationProtocol available via DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD014869.","AbstractBackgroundBisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor‐kappa B ligand (RANKL)‐inhibitors are amongst the bone‐modifying agents used as supportive treatment in women with breast cancer who do not have bone metastases. These agents aim to reduce bone loss and the risk of fractures. Bisphosphonates have demonstrated survival benefits, particularly in postmenopausal women.ObjectivesTo assess and compare the effects of different bone‐modifying agents as supportive treatment to reduce bone mineral density loss and osteoporotic fractures in women with breast cancer without bone metastases and generate a ranking of treatment options using network meta‐analyses (NMAs).Search methodsWe identified studies by electronically searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase until January 2023. We searched various trial registries and screened abstracts of conference proceedings and reference lists of identified trials.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials comparing different bisphosphonates and RANKL‐inihibitors with each other or against no further treatment or placebo for women with breast cancer without bone metastases.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Outcomes were bone mineral density, quality of life, overall fractures, overall survival and adverse events. We conducted NMAs and generated treatment rankings.Main resultsForty‐seven trials (35,163 participants) fulfilled our inclusion criteria; 34 trials (33,793 participants) could be considered in the NMA (8 different treatment options).Bone mineral densityWe estimated that the bone mineral density of participants with no treatment/placebo measured as total T‐score was ‐1.34. Evidence from the NMA (9 trials; 1166 participants) suggests that treatment with ibandronate (T‐score ‐0.77; MD 0.57, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 1.19) may slightly increase bone mineral density (low certainty) and treatment with zoledronic acid (T‐score ‐0.45; MD 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.16) probably slightly increases bone mineral density compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Risedronate (T‐score ‐1.08; MD 0.26, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.84) may result in little to no difference compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty). We are uncertain whether alendronate (T‐score 2.36; MD 3.70, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 9.41) increases bone mineral density compared to no treatment/placebo (very low certainty).Quality of lifeNo quantitative analyses could be performed for quality of life, as only three studies reported this outcome. All three studies showed only minimal differences between the respective interventions examined.Overall fracture rateWe estimated that 70 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo had fractures. Evidence from the NMA (16 trials; 19,492 participants) indicates that treatment with clodronate or ibandronate (42 of 1000; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.92; 40 of 1000; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.86, respectively) decreases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (high certainty). Denosumab or zoledronic acid (51 of 1000; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.01; 55 of 1000; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11, respectively) probably slightly decreases the number of fractures; and risedronate (39 of 1000; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.16) probably decreases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Pamidronate (106 of 1000; RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.06) probably increases the number of fractures compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty).Overall survivalWe estimated that 920 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo survived overall. Evidence from the NMA (17 trials; 30,991 participants) suggests that clodronate (924 of 1000; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17), denosumab (927 of 1000; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.21), ibandronate (915 of 1000; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.34) and zoledronic acid (925 of 1000; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.14) may result in little to no difference regarding overall survival compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty). Additionally, we are uncertain whether pamidronate (905 of 1000; HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.78) decreases overall survival compared to no treatment/placebo (very low certainty).Osteonecrosis of the jawWe estimated that 1 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo developed osteonecrosis of the jaw. Evidence from the NMA (12 trials; 23,527 participants) suggests that denosumab (25 of 1000; RR 24.70, 95% CI 9.56 to 63.83), ibandronate (6 of 1000; RR 5.77, 95% CI 2.04 to 16.35) and zoledronic acid (9 of 1000; RR 9.41, 95% CI 3.54 to 24.99) probably increases the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Additionally, clodronate (3 of 1000; RR 2.65, 95% CI 0.83 to 8.50) may increase the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to no treatment/placebo (low certainty).Renal impairmentWe estimated that 14 of 1000 participants with no treatment/placebo developed renal impairment. Evidence from the NMA (12 trials; 22,469 participants) suggests that ibandronate (28 of 1000; RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.88) probably increases the occurrence of renal impairment compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty). Zoledronic acid (21 of 1000; RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.58) probably increases the occurrence of renal impairment while clodronate (12 of 1000; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39) and denosumab (11 of 1000; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.19) probably results in little to no difference regarding the occurrence of renal impairment compared to no treatment/placebo (moderate certainty).Authors' conclusionsWhen considering bone‐modifying agents for managing bone loss in women with early or locally advanced breast cancer, one has to balance between efficacy and safety. Our findings suggest that bisphosphonates (excluding alendronate and pamidronate) or denosumab compared to no treatment or placebo likely results in increased bone mineral density and reduced fracture rates. Our survival analysis that included pre and postmenopausal women showed little to no difference regarding overall survival. These treatments may lead to more adverse events. Therefore, forming an overall judgement of the best ranked bone‐modifying agent is challenging. More head‐to‐head comparisons, especially comparing denosumab with any bisphosphonate, are needed to address gaps and validate the findings of this review.",1
"The immune system plays a crucial role in protecting the body from invading pathogens and maintaining tissue homoeostasis. Maintaining homoeostatic lipid metabolism is an important aspect of efficient immune cell function and when disrupted immune cell function is impaired. There are numerous metabolic diseases whereby systemic lipid metabolism and cellular function is impaired. In the context of metabolic disorders, chronic inflammation is suggested to be a major contributor to disease progression. A major contributor to tissue dysfunction in metabolic disease is ectopic lipid deposition, which is generally caused by diet and genetic factors. Thus, we propose the idea, that similar to tissue and organ damage in metabolic disorders, excessive accumulation of lipid in immune cells promotes a dysfunctional immune system (beyond the classical foam cell) and contributes to disease pathology. Herein, we review the evidence that lipid accumulation through diet can modulate the production and function of immune cells by altering cellular lipid content. This can impact immune cell signalling, activation, migration, and death, ultimately affecting key aspects of the immune system such as neutralising pathogens, antigen presentation, effector cell activation and resolving inflammation.","Cancer poses a significant global health challenge, contributing to substantial mortality rates and driving the urgent need for exploration into bioactive compounds with potent anticancer properties.

"SUMMARYA schematic of a biological system, that is, a representation of its pieces, how they are combined, and what they do, would facilitate understanding its essential organization and alteration in pathogenesis or evolution. We present a computational approach for constructing tissue schematics (TSs) from high-parameter imaging data and a biological model for interpreting them. TSs map the spatial assembly of cellular neighborhoods into tissue motifs, whose modular composition, we propose, enables the generation of complex outputs. We developed our approach in human lymphoid tissue (HLT), identifying the follicular outer zone as a potential relay between neighboring zones and a core lymphoid assembly with modifications characteristic of each HLT type. Applying the TS approach to the tumor microenvironment in human colorectal cancer identified a higher-order motif, whose mutated assembly was negatively associated with patient survival. TSs may therefore elucidate how immune architectures can be specialized and become vulnerable to reprogramming by tumors.","BackgroundDifferent from other malignant gynecologic tumors, gestational trophoblastic neoplasms (GTNs) exhibit an exceptionally high cure rate primarily through chemotherapeutic interventions. However, there exists a small subset of refractory GTNs that do not respond to conventional chemotherapies. In such cases, the emergence of immunotherapies has demonstrated significant benefits in managing various challenging GTNs.PurposeThis article aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the immune microenvironment and immunotherapeutic approaches for GTNs. The purpose is to identify potential biomarkers that could enhance disease management and summarize the available immunotherapies for ease of reference.MethodsWe reviewed the relevant literatures toward immunotherapies of GTNs from PubMed.ConclusionCurrent immunotherapeutic strategies for GTNs mainly revolve around immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Prominent examples include avelumab, pembrolizumab, and camrelizumab. However, existing researches into the underlying mechanisms are still limited.",0
"ABSTRACTEpithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a member of the small hydrophobic membrane protein subfamily. EMP1 is aberrantly expressed in various tumor tissues and governs multiple cellular behaviors (for example, proliferation, differentiation, and migration). The resultant regulation of the cancer pathway is responsible for the metastasis of cancer cells and determines the risk of malignant tumor progression. This review provides an updated overview of EMP1 as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor contingent on the cancer type and summarizes its upstream regulators and downstream target genes. This systematic review summarizes our current understanding of the role of EMP1 in malignant tumor development, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for its potential use as the biomarker and therapeutic target.","Phenotypic plasticity, the capacity of cells to transition between distinct phenotypic and lineage states over time, is a genetically and epigenetically encoded trait essential for normal development and adult tissue homeostasis. In cancer, phenotypic plasticity programs can be deployed aberrantly to enable disease progression and acquired therapeutic resistance. Cancer phenotypic plasticity is a current barrier to achieving cures for advanced cancers using available molecularly targeted therapies. This review summarizes the complex and interconnected molecular pathways implicated in phenotypic plasticity, both in the context of normal tissue homeostasis and cancer. Molecular pathways convergent between these contexts are highlighted while pathways enabling plasticity are distinguished from those that specify the phenotype of already plastic cells. Key unresolved questions in the field are discussed along with emerging technologies that may be used to help answer them.",1
"BackgroundDelivering stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with multiple oligometastases represents a challenge for clinical and technical reasons. We aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with SABR and the impact of tumor volume on survival.Materials and methodsWe included all the patients treated with single course SABR for 3 to 5 extracranial oligometastases. All patients were treated with the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique with ablative intent. End-points of the analysis were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), local control (LC) and toxicity.Results136 patients were treated from 2012 to 2020 on 451 oligometastases. Most common primary tumor was colorectal cancer (44.1%) followed by lung cancer (11.8%). A total of 3, 4 and 5 lesions were simultaneously treated in 102 (75.0%), 26 (19.1%), and 8 (5.9%) patients, respectively. Median total tumor volume (TTV) was 19.1 cc (range 0.6–245.1). With a median follow-up of 25.0 months, OS at 1 and 3 years was 88.4% and 50.2%, respectively. Increasing TTV was independent predictive factor of worse OS (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.18–4.78, p = 0.014) and PFS (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.05–2.54; p = 0.028). Median OS was 80.6 months if tumor volume was ≤ 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 93.6% and 77.5%, respectively), and 31.1 months if TTV was higher than 10 cc (1 and 3 years OS rate 86.7% and 42.3%, respectively). Rates of LC at 1 and 3 years were 89.3% and 76.5%. In terms of toxicity, no grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported both in the acute and late settings.ConclusionWe demonstrated the impact of tumor volume on survival and disease control of patients affected by multiple oligometastases treated with single course SABR.","BackgroundRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 80–90% of all kidney tumors and about 15–25% of patients will develop distant metastases. Systemic therapy represents the standard of care for metastatic patients, but stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) may play a relevant role in the oligoprogressive setting, defined as the progression of few metastases during an ongoing systemic therapy on a background of otherwise stable disease. Aim of the present study was to analyze the outcome of RCC patients treated with SABR on oligoprogressive metastases.Materials and methodsIn this monocenter study, we analyzed patients affected by RCC treated with SABR on a maximum of 5 cranial or extracranial oligoprogressive sites of disease. Endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity.ResultsWe included 74 oligoprogressions (26 intracranial and 48 extracranial) and 57 SABR treatments in 44 patients. Most common concomitant treatments were sunitinib (28, 49.1%), pazopanib (12, 21.0%) and nivolumab (11, 19.3%). Median follow-up was 19.0 months, and 1- and 2-year OS rates were 79.2% and 57.3%, respectively. Repeated SABR was a positive predictive factor for OS (p = 0.034). Median PFS was 9.8 months, with 1- and 2-year rates of 43.2% and 25.8%. At multivariable analysis, disease-free interval (p = 0.022) and number of treated metastases (p = 0.007) were significant for PFS. About 80% of patients continued the ongoing systemic therapy 1- and 2-years after SABR with no grade 3 or 4 toxicities.Conclusionswe confirmed the efficacy and safety of SABR for oligoprogression from RCC, with the potential to ablate resistant metastases and to prolong the ongoing systemic therapy.",1
"AbstractA key component that has limited the efficacy of immunotherapy in glioblastoma (GBM) is the significant infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Our previous work characterized myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) unique to GBM that drive tumor growth and immune suppression. Transcriptomic and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that the most induced programs in these MDSCs are dominated by metabolic and mTOR pathways. Therefore, we aimed to understand the role of metabolic reprogramming in MDSC differentiation and immunosuppressive function. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identified overexpression of enzymes and transporters involved in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, notably branched chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), the first enzyme in the metabolic pathway. Intriguingly, this was only found in specific populations of early and monocytic MDSCs (E-MDSCs, M-MDSCs), and not polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs). Using established MDSC modeling systems, we found that M-MDSC differentiation and T cell suppressive function are dependent on BCAAs and can be hindered by pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 activity or genetic knockout of BCAT1. We also establish that the influence of BCAA on M-MDSC function is specifically reliant on the BCAT1-mediated step of BCAA metabolism. To determine the underlying mechanism driving BCAT1’s impact on M-MDSC function, we evaluated the activity of signaling pathways known to be critical to M-MDSCs including the mTORC1 pathway. We found that the impact of BCAA and BCAT1 activity on M-MDSC function is abrogated by inhibition of mTORC1 pathway with reduction in M-MDSC differentiation and activity. Consistent with our single cell RNA sequencing analysis, modulation of BCAA levels and BCAT1 activity had no impact on PMN-MDSCs. Our results underscore the critical role of BCAT1 in preferentially modulating M-MDSC activity through mTORC1 signaling. Our finding paves the way for discovery of a targetable therapeutic approach to harness immunometabolism in myeloid cells to develop novel immune therapies.","Primary melanoma of the oral cavity is extremely rare, accounting for 0.2–8% of all melanomas. Lesions arising from mucosal melanocytes occur most frequently on the gingiva or palate. Mucosal melanomas carry a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanomas. Very few studies have been published due to rarity of disease. 46 year old lady presented with black colored lesion over left side of her tongue for 6 weeks. On examination there was 3 × 2.5 cm black colored patch over left lateral part of tongue in middle 1/3rd, not crossing midline. Tip and base of tongue were free. Biopsy was suggestive of malignant melanoma of tongue. Patient underwent surgery (wide local excision of left lateral border of tongue lesion + left selective neck dissection). Final Histopathological report revealed malignant melanoma of tongue with all margins free, Depth of invasion 3 mm, Lympho-vascular invasion present, and no perineural invasion, left level III cervical lymph node metastases. Patient thus received adjuvant RT. Immunotherapy was also advised in multidisciplinary clinic, but patient was non-compliant. Early diagnosis will be promoted by careful oral examination and early biopsy of pigmented and non-pigmented masses. Early diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis of patients with oral malignant melanoma.",0
"A century ago, Otto Warburg's work sparked the field of cancer metabolism, which has since taken a tortuous path. As evidence accumulated over the decades, consensus views of causes of cancer emerged, whereby genetic and epigenetic oncogenic drivers promoted immune evasion and induced new blood vessels and neoplastic metabolism to support tumor growth. Neoplastic cells abandon social cues of intercellular cooperation, escape tissue confinement, metastasize, and ultimately kill the host. Herein, key milestones in the study of cancer metabolism are chronicled with an emphasis on carbohydrate metabolism. The field began with a cancer cell–autonomous view that has been refined by a richer understanding of solid cancers as growing, immune-suppressive, complex organs comprising different cell types that are nourished by a variety of nutrients and variable amounts of oxygen through abnormal neovasculatures. Based on foundational historical studies, our current understanding of cancer metabolism offers a hopeful outlook for targeting metabolism to enhance cancer therapy.","Infusion of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that target B cells has proven to be a successful treatment for B cell malignancies. This success inspired the development of CAR T cells to selectively deplete or modulate the aberrant immune responses that underlie autoimmune disease. Promising results are emerging from clinical trials of CAR T cells targeting the B cell protein CD19 in patients with B cell-driven autoimmune diseases. Further approaches are being designed to extend the application and improve safety of CAR T cell therapy in the setting of autoimmunity, including the use of chimeric autoantibody receptors to selectively deplete autoantigen-specific B cells and the use of regulatory T cells engineered to express antigen-specific CARs for targeted immune modulation. Here we highlight important considerations, such as optimal target cell populations, CAR construct design, acceptable toxicities and potential for lasting immune reset, that will inform the eventual safe adoption of CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",0
"Hematological cancers, such as lymphomas and leukemias, pose significant challenges in oncology, necessitating a deeper understanding of their molecular landscape to enhance therapeutic strategies. This article critically examines and discusses recent research on the roles of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in myeloma, lymphomas, and leukemias with a particular focus on pediatric acute lymphoblastic (lymphocytic) leukemia (ALL). By utilizing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we analyzed GPCR expression patterns in pediatric ALL samples (aged 3–12 years old), with a further focus on Class A orphan GPCRs. Our analysis revealed distinct GPCR expression profiles in pediatric ALL, identifying several candidates with aberrant upregulated expression compared with healthy counterparts. Among these GPCRs, GPR85, GPR65, and GPR183 have varying numbers of studies in the field of hematological cancers and pediatric ALL. Furthermore, we explored missense mutations of pediatric ALL in relation to the RNA gene expression findings, providing insights into the genetic underpinnings of this disease. By integrating both RNA-seq and missense mutation data, this article aims to provide an insightful and broader perspective on the potential correlations between specific GPCR and their roles in pediatric ALL.","PurposeThe crucial role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy has been broadly depicted. However, the molecular phenotypic linkages between m6A modification pattern and immunological ecosystem are expected to be disentangled in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for immunotherapeutic unresponsiveness circumvention and combination with promising drug agents.MethodsModification patterns of m6A methylation were qualitatively dissected according to the large-scale HCC samples profiling. We then determined the immune phenotypic linkages by systematically evaluating their tumor microenvironment composition, immune/stromal-relevant signature, immune checkpoints correlation, and prognostic value. Individual quantification of m6A methylation pattern was achieved by m6Ascore construction, intensified by longitudinal single-cell analysis of immunotherapy cohort and validated by the transcriptomic profiles of our in-hospital GDPH-HCC cohort. Candidate therapeutic agents were also screened out.ResultsThree distinct m6A methylation patterns were determined in high accordance with inflamed-, excluded-, and desert-immunophenotype. To be precise, Immune-inflamed high-m6Ascore group was characterized by activated immunity with favorable prognosis. Stromal activation and absence of immune cell infiltration were observed in low-m6Ascore phenotype, linked to impaired outcome. Patients with low-m6Ascore demonstrated diminished responses and clinical benefits for cohorts receiving immunotherapy. The above credible linkage between m6A methylation pattern and tumor immune microenvironment was robustly validated in our GDPH-HCC cohort. Single-cell dynamic change of m6A methylation level in exhausted CD8 T cell and fibroblast was depicted in immunotherapy cohort fore and art. Derived from m6A methylation pattern, seven potential frontline drug agents were recognized as promising choice for high-m6Ascore patients.ConclusionOur work bridged the credible linkage between epigenetics and anti-tumor immunity in HCC, unraveling m6A modification pattern as immunological indicator and predictor for immunotherapy. Individualized m6Ascore facilitated strategic choices to maximize therapy-responsive possibility.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04589-2.",0
"AbstractBackgroundWe examined the relationship between neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cognition in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at baseline and longitudinally.MethodsPlasma and clinical data were available from virally suppressed people with HIV (PWH) aged ≥45 years in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group HAILO study. Four neuropsychological assessments standardized and averaged (NPZ-4) represented cognition. Plasma collection date marked baseline; slope summarized longitudinal NPZ-4 changes. Linear regressions examined biomarkers associations with baseline NPZ-4 and longitudinal change.ResultsThe study included 503 participants with a median age of 52 (interquartile range [IQR, 48–57]) years and observation of 6 (IQR, 5–7) years, and 26% had baseline cognitive impairment defined by HAILO. Cross-sectionally, higher NfL (β = −.76, P < .01) and GFAP (β = −.44, P = .02) were associated with worse NPZ-4. Longitudinally, the median NPZ-4 slope was 0.003 (IQR, −0.06 to 0.06) units/year with 48% demonstrating cognitive decline. Higher NfL (β = −.08, P < .01), but not GFAP (β = −.03, P = .08), was associated with cognitive decline.ConclusionsNfL and GFAP were associated with worse cognition cross-sectionally; only NfL was associated with cognitive decline. Their clinical utility remains uncertain given small effect sizes and should be studied in populations with more rapid decline.","BackgroundThis study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MethodsElectronic databases were scanned to identify relevant trials. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and their prognostic factors. Stratified analyses were accomplished on ICIs agent and evaluation criteria.ResultsTotally, 3697 individuals from 40 cohorts were recruited. For patients treated with ICIs, the pooled median time to progression (TTP) was 8.0 months, median PFS 4.9 months, and median OS 12.0 months; the pooled median PFS and OS of ICIs plus anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents (PFS: 6.3 months, OS: 16.4 months) were longer than those of ICIs alone. Furthermore, Child–Pugh stage (HR = 1.37, P = 0.0123) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (HR = 1.40, P = 0.0016) were prognostic factors for PFS. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0356), Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR = 1.17, P < 0.0001), Child–Pugh stage (HR = 1.58, P < 0.0001), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (HR = 1.23, P = 0.0005), ECOG (HR = 1.50, P = 0.0012), portal vein invasion (HR = 1.32, P = 0.0053), extrahepatic metastasis (HR = 0.84, P = 0.0047), best response (HR = 0.58, P < 0.0001), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (HR = 1.23, P = 0.0451) were the prognostic factors for OS. According to both RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) rate of ICIs plus anti-VEGF agents were better than those of ICIs alone. The overall rate of any grade adverse events (AEs) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.61–0.89), grade 3 or higher AEs was 0.28 (95% CI 0.15–0.42), and the rate of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 0.09 (95% CI 0.06–0.12).ConclusionsThe ICIs was promising in HCC with good efficacy and tolerated toxicity. Compared with ICIs monotherapy, the joint application of ICIs and anti-VEGF agents can contribute a lot more benefits to the survival of patients according to clinical practices.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03716-1.",0
"MEK inhibitors (MEKis) have shown limited success as a treatment for MAPK/ERK pathway–dependent cancers due to various resistance mechanisms tumor cells can employ. CH5126766 (CKI27) is an inhibitor that binds to MEK and prevents release of RAF, reducing the relief of negative feedback commonly observed with other MEKis. We observed that CKI27 increased MHC expression on tumor cells and improved T cell–mediated killing. Yet, CKI27 also decreased T-cell proliferation, activation, and cytolytic activity by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway that is activated downstream of T cell–receptor signaling. Therefore, we aimed to balance the positive and negative immunomodulatory effects of MEKis for optimal combination with immunotherapy. Intermittent administration of CKI27 allowed T cells to partially recover and co-stimulation via GITR and OX-40 agonist antibodies completely alleviated inhibition of function. In Kras mutant lung and colon tumor mouse models, intermittent CKI27 and anti-GITR significantly decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival when further combined with CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade. Moreover, this triple combination increased CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell proliferation, activation, and effector/memory subsets in the tumor draining lymph nodes and tumors and led to intratumoral regulatory T cell (Treg) destabilization. These data, collectively, will allow for more informed decisions when optimizing combination regimens by overcoming resistance, reducing toxicity, and generating long-term immune responses.","PurposeApproximately 5% of patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) may develop recurrent or metastatic disease. The management of such cases is challenging and requires multi-disciplinary care. Immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibition was approved to treat unresectable or metastatic CSCC in 2018. Given limited data regarding clinical outcomes outside of published trials, we describe our experience using this therapy.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with PD-1 inhibition as therapy for locally advanced, regionally metastatic or distant metastatic CSCC at the University of Southern California. Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment data using PD-1 inhibitors, and outcomes were assessed.ResultsAmong 26 patients treated with PD-1 inhibition, the objective response rate was 42.3%, with 19.2% of patients having partial response and 23.1% having complete response to therapy. The median progression-free survival was 5.4 months. Median tumor mutational burden (TMB) was higher among responders compared to non-responders (60 vs. 9 Mut/Mb, p = 0.04). Primary CSCC tumor location on the head/neck was also associated with response to PD-1 inhibition (p = 0.04). Two patients with mutations affecting mismatch repair deficiency were noted to have complete response to treatment. No other variables were associated with treatment outcomes.ConclusionPD-1 inhibition produces durable responses among patients with advanced or metastatic CSCC. PD-1 inhibition therapy is well tolerated, but patients should be monitored closely for immune-related adverse events, particularly frail or immune-suppressed patients. Further investigation of potential biomarkers to help identify patients who will derive the most benefit from this therapeutic option is needed.",1
"ABSTRACTBackgroundCancer is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Survivorship is increasing, bringing new challenges. Cancer treatment, including chemotherapeutic drugs, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, can have severe and impactful gastrointestinal side effects occurring shortly after treatment (acute toxicity) or persisting for years after treatment ends (late/chronic toxicity).PurposeThe aim of this article is to review the neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy on the enteric nervous system (ENS) and the gut extrinsic innervation. These effects could contribute to the development of long‐term gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Research, primarily conducted in animal models, indicates that antitumoral drugs can lead to chemotherapy‐induced enteric neuropathy (CIEN). Studies, mainly performed in the myenteric plexus, show that CIEN is characterized by a reduced density of nerve cells and fibers, as well as an imbalanced representation of neuronal subpopulations or their markers, with enteric glial cells also affected.These alterations underlie changes in neuronal activity and gastrointestinal motor function. Although research on the submucosal plexus remains limited, evidence suggests that CIEN affects the entire ENS. Furthermore, scarce studies show that CIEN also occurs in humans. Moreover, emerging experimental data on chemotherapy‐induced alterations in visceral sensitivity suggest that the extrinsic innervation of the gut is also affected, but this has received little attention thus far. Nevertheless, this could contribute to the development of chemotherapy‐induced brain–gut axis (BGA) disorders in the long term. Cancer chemotherapy (and probably also immunotherapy and radiotherapy) seems to cause neuropathic effects on the intrinsic and extrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract, with an important impact on gastrointestinal and BGA functions. This is a relatively neglected area deserving further investigation.","BackgroundSeveral translational animal models have been described assessing intra-arterial (IA) treatments for malignant gliomas. We describe the first endovascular animal model that allows testing of IA drug delivery as a first-line treatment, which is difficult to do in actual patients. We report a unique protocol for vascular access and IA delivery in the rat model that, unlike prior reports, does not require direct puncture and opening of proximal cerebrovasculature which carries risk of ischemia in the animal brain post-delivery.MethodsWistar rats underwent left femoral artery catherization with a Balt Magic 1.2F catheter or Marathon Flow directed 1.5F Microcatheter with an Asahi Chikai 0.008 micro-guidewire which was navigated to the left internal carotid artery under x-ray. 25% mannitol was administered to test blood brain barrier breakdown (BBBB). Additional rats were implanted with C6 glioma cells in the left frontal lobe. C6 Glioma-Implanted Rats (C6GRs) were monitored for overall survival and tumor growth. Tumor volumes from MRI images were calculated utilizing 3D slicer. Additional rats underwent femoral artery catheterization with Bevacizumab, carboplatin, or irinotecan injected into the left internal carotid artery to test feasibility and safety.ResultsA successful endovascular access and BBBB protocol was established. BBBB was confirmed with positive Evans blue staining. 10 rats were successfully implanted with C6 gliomas with confirmed growths on MRI. Overall survival was 19.75 ± 2.21 days. 5 rats were utilized for the development of our femoral catheterization protocol and BBBB testing. With regards to IA chemotherapy dosage testing, control rats tolerated targeted 10 mg/kg of bevascizumab, 2.4 mg/kg of carboplatin, and 15 mg/kg of irinotecan IA ICA injections without any complications.ConclusionsWe present the first endovascular IA rat glioma model that allows selective catheterization of the intracranial vasculature and assessment of IA therapies for gliomas without need for access and sacrifice of proximal cerebrovasculature.",1
"SummaryBackgroundMycobacterium tuberculosis is the main causative agent of tuberculosis. BCG, the only licensed vaccine, provides inadequate protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. Controlled human infection models are useful tools for vaccine development. We aimed to determine a safe dose of aerosol-inhaled live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG as a surrogate for M tuberculosis infection, then compare the safety and tolerability of infection models established using aerosol-inhaled and intradermally administered BCG.MethodsThis phase 1 controlled human infection trial was conducted at two clinical research facilities in the UK. Healthy, immunocompetent adults aged 18–50 years, who were both M tuberculosis-naive and BCG-naive and had no history of asthma or other respiratory diseases, were eligible for the trial. Participants were initially enrolled into group 1 (receiving the BCG Danish strain); the trial was subsequently paused because of a worldwide shortage of BCG Danish and, after protocol amendment, was restarted using the BCG Bulgaria strain (group 2). After a dose-escalation study, during which participants were sequentially allocated to receive either 1 × 103, 1 × 104, 1 × 105, 1 × 106, or 1 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) of aerosol BCG, the maximum tolerated dose was selected for the randomised controlled trial. Participants in this trial were randomly assigned (9:12), by variable block randomisation and using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes, to receive aerosol BCG (1 × 107 CFU) and intradermal saline or intradermal BCG (1 × 106 CFU) and aerosol saline. Participants were masked to treatment allocation until day 14. The primary outcome was to compare the safety of a controlled human infection model based on aerosol-inhaled BCG versus one based on intradermally administered BCG, and the secondary outcome was to evaluate BCG recovery in the airways of participants who received aerosol BCG or skin biopsies of participants who received intradermal BCG. BCG was detected by culture and by PCR. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02709278, and is complete.FindingsParticipants were assessed for eligibility between April 7, 2016, and Sept 29, 2018. For group 1, 15 participants were screened, of whom 13 were enrolled and ten completed the study; for group 2, 60 were screened and 33 enrolled, all of whom completed the study. Doses up to 1 × 107 CFU aerosol-inhaled BCG were sufficiently well tolerated. No significant difference was observed in the frequency of adverse events between aerosol and intradermal groups (median percentage of solicited adverse events per participant, post-aerosol vs post-intradermal BCG: systemic 7% [IQR 2–11] vs 4% [1–13], p=0·62; respiratory 7% [1–19] vs 4% [1–9], p=0·56). More severe systemic adverse events occurred in the 2 weeks after aerosol BCG (15 [12%] of 122 reported systemic adverse events) than after intradermal BCG (one [1%] of 94; difference 11% [95% CI 5–17]; p=0·0013), but no difference was observed in the severity of respiratory adverse events (two [1%] of 144 vs zero [0%] of 97; 1% [−1 to 3]; p=0·52). All adverse events after aerosol BCG resolved spontaneously. One serious adverse event was reported—a participant in group 2 was admitted to hospital to receive analgesia for a pre-existing ovarian cyst, which was deemed unrelated to BCG infection. On day 14, BCG was cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage samples after aerosol infection and from skin biopsy samples after intradermal infection.InterpretationThis first-in-human aerosol BCG controlled human infection model was sufficiently well tolerated. Further work will evaluate the utility of this model in assessing vaccine efficacy and identifying potential correlates of protection.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley Clinical Research Network, and TBVAC2020.","Background: Although the impact of tumor-immune infiltrate has been reported on differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) behavior, the expression of immune checkpoints [programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1)] alone has not been able to predict response to immunotherapies. We aimed to identify tumor-infiltrating immune cells and checkpoints associated with DTC.Methods: We performed multiplex immunofluorescence on deparaffinized thyroid tissue collected at thyroidectomy from 17 adults with DTC to characterize the tumor immune microenvironment for leukocytes (CD45+), T cells (CD3+), T regulatory cells (Tregs) (CD3+FOXP3+), CD4+ T cells (CD3+CD4+), CD8+ T cells (CD3+CD8+), macrophages (CD68+), M2 macrophages (CD68+CD163+), M1 Macrophages (CD68+ inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]+), and immune checkpoints PD-1 and PD-L1. We compared the mean percentage expression of immune markers between tumor and adjacent thyroid tissue from the same patient by paired t-test and performed spatial analysis along the tumor’s leading edge.Results: Immune checkpoints PD-1 and PD-L1 showed a significant increase in expression intratumorally as compared to adjacent thyroid tissue (p < 0.05). A higher trend for M2 macrophages was observed intratumorally compared to adjacent tissue. Along the leading edge, PD-L1 expression correlated negatively with CD45 and positively with CD163 intratumorally. On exploratory analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend for higher FOXP3 but less CD8 and iNOS expression in tumor from DTC with (n = 3) versus without distant metastases (n = 14). There was a nonsignificant trend for higher CD58 and iNOS expression in DTC with (n = 7) than without thyroiditis (n = 10).Conclusions: Higher tumoral PD-1 and PD-L1 expression indicate their role in DTC occurrence. A trend for more Tregs and M2 macrophages but less M1 macrophages intratumorally in patients with distant metastatic DTC, suggests their potential role as prognostic biomarkers. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to compare various clinicopathologic severities to harness tumor microenvironment for cancer prognostication and therapy.",0
"PurposeThe updated guidelines highlight gene expression-based multigene panel as a critical tool to assess overall survival (OS) and improve treatment for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Nevertheless, genome-wide expression signatures are still limited in real clinical utility because of insufficient data utilization, a lack of critical validation, and inapposite machine learning algorithms.Methods2330 primary LUAD samples were enrolled from 11 independent cohorts. Seventy-six algorithm combinations based on ten machine learning algorithms were applied. A total of 108 published gene expression signatures were collected. Multiple pharmacogenomics databases and resources were utilized to identify precision therapeutic drugs.ResultsWe comprehensively developed a robust machine learning-derived genome-wide expression signature (RGS) according to stably OS-associated RNAs (OSRs). RGS was an independent risk element and remained robust and reproducible power by comparing it with general clinical parameters, molecular characteristics, and 108 published signatures. RGS-based stratification possessed different biological behaviors, molecular mechanisms, and immune microenvironment patterns. Integrating multiple databases and previous studies, we identified that alisertib was sensitive to the high-risk group, and RITA was sensitive to the low-risk group.ConclusionOur study offers an appealing platform to screen dismal prognosis LUAD patients to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing precision therapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04814-y.","PurposeThe benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors’ (ICIs) combination therapy in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remained unclear. We performed a meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of ICIs’ combination therapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC.MethodsA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ICIs’ combination therapy as first-line treatment in advanced ESCC was conducted via searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database. The data for efficacy and safety of ICIs’ combination therapy were subject to meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with different PD-L1 expression status.ResultsA total of 5 RCTs and 3163 patients were included. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) benefit with ICIs’ combination therapy was 0.68 (95% CI 0.62–0.75) compared with chemotherapy alone. The HR for progression-free survival (PFS) benefit and the odds ratio (OR) for overall response rate (ORR) increase were 0.62 (95% CI 0.56–0.68) and 2.01 (95% CI 1.70–2.38), respectively. The OS and PFS benefits with ICIs’ combination therapy over chemotherapy alone were also observed in the subgroup of PD-L1 positive expression, but not in the subgroup of PD-L1 negative expression. The incidence of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events was 60.4% with ICIs’ combination therapy and 56.3% with chemotherapy alone (OR, 1.19; 95% CI 0.90–1.57).ConclusionICIs’ combination therapy showed superior OS, PFS, and ORR over chemotherapy alone with a manageable safety profile. These results suggested that ICIs’ combination therapy can be considered as a new first-line treatment for advanced ESCC.",0
"AbstractBackgroundThis study validates MRI-based tumor habitats in predicting time-to-progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and progression sites in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma patients.MethodsSeventy-nine patients were prospectively enrolled between January 2020 and June 2022. MRI, including diffusion-weighted and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, were obtained immediately postoperation and at three serial timepoints. Voxels from cerebral blood volume and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were grouped into three habitats (hypervascular cellular, hypovascular cellular, and nonviable tissue) using k-means clustering. Predefined cutoffs for increases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitat were applied to calculate the habitat risk score. Associations between spatiotemporal habitats, habitat risk score, TTP, and OS were investigated using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Habitat risk score was compared to tumor volume using time-dependent receiver operating characteristics analysis. Progression sites were matched with spatial habitats.ResultsIncreases in hypervascular and hypovascular cellular habitats and habitat risk scores were associated with shorter TTP and OS (all P < .05). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk scores 1 and 2 independently predicted TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 4.14; P = .03, HR, 4.51; P = .001 and HR, 10.02; P < .001, respectively). Hypovascular cellular habitat and habitat risk score 2 independently predicted OS (HR, 4.01, P = .003; and HR, 3.27, P < .001, respectively). Habitat risk score outperformed tumor volume in predicting TTP (12-month AUC, 0.762 vs. 0.646, P = .048). Hypovascular cellular habitat predicted progression sites (mean Dice index: 0.31).ConclusionsMultiparametric physiologic MRI-based spatiotemporal tumor habitats and habitat risk scores are useful biomarkers for early tumor progression and outcomes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients.","AbstractBackgroundHuman gliomas are classified using isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status as a prognosticator; however, the influence of genetic differences and treatment effects on ensuing immunity remains unclear.MethodsIn this study, we used sequential single-cell transcriptomics on 144 678 and spectral cytometry on over 2 million immune cells encompassing 48 human gliomas to decipher their immune landscape.ResultsWe identified 22 distinct immune cell types that contribute to glioma immunity. Specifically, brain-resident microglia (MG) were reduced with a concomitant increase in CD8+ T lymphocytes during glioma recurrence independent of IDH status. In contrast, IDH-wild type-associated patterns, such as an abundance of antigen-presenting cell-like MG and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, were observed. Beyond elucidating the differences in IDH, relapse, and treatment-associated immunity, we discovered novel inflammatory MG subpopulations expressing granulysin, a cytotoxic peptide that is otherwise expressed in lymphocytes only. Furthermore, we provide a robust genomic framework for defining macrophage polarization beyond M1/M2 paradigm and reference signatures of glioma-specific tumor immune microenvironment (termed GlioTIME-36) for deconvoluting transcriptomic datasets.ConclusionsThis study provides advanced optics of the human pan-glioma immune contexture as a valuable guide for translational and clinical applications.",1
"Background and ObjectivesTo assess mismatch repair (MMR) status and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix and their association with clinicopathologic parameters.Material and MethodsExpression of PD-L1 and MMR status (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2) was assessed on 50 cases of SCCs of the cervix by immunohistochemistry.Results80% of tumor cells and 84% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed PD-L1 expression. 80% of cases had a combined positive score (CPS) of > 1, whereas 20% had a CPS of < 1. 94% of cases showed pMMR proteins, while 6% showed dMMR. 94% of the SCCs were HPV associated, and 6% were HPV-independent. All HPV-independent SCCs of the cervix showed PD-L1 expression, and all HPV-associated SCCs showed MMR deficiency. Between PD-L1 expression in the tumor and the grade of the tumor, a statistically significant association was noted (p = 0.022). All MMR-deficient SCCs were HPV-independent.ConclusionThis research highlighted the HPV association in cervical SCCs in the Indian population. Most of the cervical SCCs were HPV-associated. Furthermore, most of the HPV-associated SCCs were MMR stable. This study found no significant association between MMR status and PD-L1 expression in cervical SCCs.","The rapid advances in cancer research have led to novel therapeutic approaches focusing on previously undruggable targets and immune evasion mechanisms. Recent innovations exemplify these cutting-edge strategies, particularly in KRAS-targeting therapies using PROTAC technology and immune modulation to address resistance in cancer cells. These developments present promising methods for degrading oncogenic proteins and enhancing immune system responses, potentially transforming the cancer treatment landscape.

"AbstractThe respiratory tract with its vast surface area and very thin air-blood tissue barrier presents an extremely large interface for potential interaction with xenobiotics such as inhaled pathogens or medicaments. To protect its large and vulnerable surface, the lung is populated with several different types of immune cells. Pulmonary epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells are key players in shaping the innate and adaptive immune response. Due to their localization, they represent a frontline of cell populations that are among the first to come in contact with inhaled xenobiotics. Furthermore, depending on the lung compartment they populate, these cells show a large variety in morphology, phenotype, and function. These unique characteristics make those cell populations ideal targets for specific immunomodulators that are designed for inhalation. Depending on cell population or lung compartment targeting, a specific immune response may be triggered or modulated. The purpose of a potent carrier for pulmonary immunomodulation is, first, to efficiently target a specific immunocompetent cell and, second, to affect its role in generating an immune response. Immunomodulation may occur at different levels of immune cell-antigen interaction, that is antigen uptake, trafficking, processing and presentation. Inhalation of nanosized carriers for drugs or vaccines shows great potential for both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches in order to modulate immune responses locally or systemically, due to the specific deposition and targeting properties of nanoparticles. Immune responses triggered by nanosized particles may be either immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive and depending on the specific purpose, stimulation or suppression may either be desired or unwanted. Meticulous analysis of immunomodulatory potential, pharmacologic and toxicologic testing of inhalable nanocarriers is required in order to find novel and optimal approaches for prophylaxis and therapy of pulmonary diseases. The design and characterization of such nanoparticles requires well-coordinated interdisciplinary research among engineers, biologists and clinicians.","AbstractHematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a serine-threonine kinase specific to hematopoiesis and a member of the MAP4K family of Ste20-related protein kinases. Targeting HPK1 to ameliorate T cell exhaustion and enhance T cell functions is a promising strategy for clinical immunotherapies. Numerous studies have reported the progress in developing effective HPK1 inhibitors and elucidating their mechanisms of action. However, most inhibitors affect multiple signaling pathways, resulting in unintended side effects that limit their clinical development and application. Herein, we reviewed HPK1-related signaling pathways, clinical candidates and recent advances in small-molecule inhibitors targeting HPK1. Additionally, we present our perspectives on current challenges and potential future research field, hoping to provide inspiration for the development of novel HPK1 inhibitors.",1
"Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies are emerging in the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as the dominant ablative approach as an alternative to surgery for primary breast cancer in patients who do not wish to have surgery or are poor surgical candidates. Cryoablation is well tolerated and provides excellent local control and cosmesis. Thermal ablation may also be used in the treatment of oligometastatic breast cancer, allowing patients to achieve long disease-free intervals. Transarterial therapies have been studied in the treatment of oligoprogressive hepatic metastasis, though further supportive data would be helpful to demonstrate its efficacy.","PurposeHGSOC is a kind of gynecological cancer with high mortality and strong heterogeneity. The study used multi-omics and multiple algorithms to identify novel molecular subtypes, which can help patients obtain more personalized treatments.MethodsFirstly, the consensus clustering result was obtained using a consensus ensemble of ten classical clustering algorithms, based on mRNA, lncRNA, DNA methylation, and mutation data. The difference in signaling pathways was evaluated using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Meanwhile, the relationship between genetic alteration, response to immunotherapy, drug sensitivity, prognosis, and subtypes was further analyzed. Finally, the reliability of the new subtype was verified in three external datasets.ResultsThree molecular subtypes were identified. Immune desert subtype (CS1) had little enrichment in the immune microenvironment and metabolic pathways. Immune/non-stromal subtype (CS2) was enriched in the immune microenvironment and metabolism of polyamines. Immune/stromal subtype (CS3) not only enriched anti-tumor immune microenvironment characteristics but also enriched pro-tumor stroma characteristics, glycosaminoglycan metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. The CS2 had the best overall survival and the highest response rate to immunotherapy. The CS3 had the worst prognosis and the lowest response rate to immunotherapy but was more sensitive to PARP and VEGFR molecular-targeted therapy. The similar differences among three subtypes were successfully validated in three external cohorts.ConclusionWe used ten clustering algorithms to comprehensively analyze four types of omics data, identified three biologically significant subtypes of HGSOC patients, and provided personalized treatment recommendations for each subtype. Our findings provided novel views into the HGSOC subtypes and could provide potential clinical treatment strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04831-x.",0
"ABSTRACTAutophagy, a lysosome-dependent protein degradation mechanism, is a highly conserved catabolic process seen in all eukaryotes. This cell protection system, which is present in all tissues and functions at a basic level, can be up- or downregulated in response to various stresses. A disruption in the natural route of the autophagy process is frequently followed by an interruption in the inherent operation of the body’s cells and organs. Probiotics are live bacteria that protect the host through various mechanisms. One of the processes through which probiotics exert their beneficial effects on various cells and tissues is autophagy. Autophagy can assist in maintaining host homeostasis by stimulating the immune system and affecting numerous physiological and pathological responses. In this review, we particularly focus on autophagy impairments occurring in several human illnesses and investigate how probiotics affect the autophagy process under various circumstances.Abbreviation: AD: Alzheimer disease; AKT: AKT serine/threonine kinase; AMPK: 5′AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy related; CCl4: carbon tetrachloride; CFS: cell-free supernatant; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CRC: colorectal cancer; EPS: L. plantarum H31 exopolysaccharide; HD: Huntington disease; HFD: high-fat diet; HPV: human papillomavirus; IFNG/IFN-γ: interferon gamma; IL6: interleukin 6; LGG: L. rhamnosus GG; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; PD: Parkinson disease; Pg3G: pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PolyQ: polyglutamine; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SCFAs: short-chain fatty acids; SLAB51: a novel formulation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria; Slp: surface layer protein (of acidophilus NCFM); SNCA: synuclein alpha; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase 1; YB: B. longum subsp. infantis YB0411; YFP: yeast fermentate prebiotic.","AbstractImmunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment paradigm for patients with brain metastases and has been found to prolong overall survival. We sought to determine whether rates of craniotomies for the treatment of brain metastases has decreased since the introduction of immunotherapy into routine treatment regimens. Pathology records were queried at our institution from 2011-2022 to include all patients surgically treated for brain metastases. A total of 885 samples from 789 unique patients were analyzed. National data was queried from the NSQIP database from 2011-2022 to include patients surgically treated for brain metastases with a total of 14,494 cases. A Craniotomy for Metastases Index (CMI) was generated to reflect the total number of craniotomies performed over time. The most common institutional primary cancers were lung (46.1%), breast (17.4%), and gastrointestinal (10.1%), with the most common lung cancers being adenocarcinoma (57.11%) and non-small cell carcinoma (11.52%). The institutional CMI demonstrated a non-significant decrease in the number of craniotomies (R2=0.0545, p=0.46) across all time ranges, as well as no significant change in CMI when comparing rates from 2011-2016 and 2017-2022 (p=0.37). The national CMI demonstrated a significantly positive slope of 0.03 (R2=0.544, p=0.006), as well as a significant increase (p=0.005) in craniotomies when comparing rates from 2011-2016 and 2017-2022. Despite the growing use and efficacy of immunotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases and increasing overall survival, the rates of craniotomies had no change institutionally and increased nationally. Several reasons for these findings may include: longer overall survival of patients with systemic cancer can lead to the development of metastatic brain tumors later in their disease course, improvement of surgical techniques making resection safer, and variable response of patients to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Further studies should be conducted to determine the effect of SRS on these findings. Surgical resection remains the mainstay in the treatment of brain metastases.",0
"ABSTRACTBackgroundThis study analyzed the application of dual bronchodilators in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) & chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during the perioperative period.Research design and methodsA total of 100 patients with moderate to severe COPD who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy were divided into two groups. The patients in the observation group (group O) were treated with umeclidinium/vilanterol and conventional treatment (oxygen therapy, assisted expectoration, respiratory rehabilitation training) during the perioperative period. The patients in the control group (group C) received conventional treatment. Lung function, arterial blood gas values, quality of life, postoperative adverse reactions, days of postoperative chest tube placement and hospitalization were assessed.ResultsBefore surgery, group O presented higher FEV1, FVC, PEF and MVV, elevated PO2 and reduced PCO2, lower CAT scores compared with the group C (p < 0.05). The group O demonstrated fewer perioperative adverse reactions, and shorter days of postoperative chest tube and hospitalization compared with the group C (p < 0.05).ConclusionsPerioperative inhalation of umeclidinium/vilanterol can effectively protect arterial blood gas and respiratory function in patients with LC complicated with COPD.","IntroductionPoliovirus receptor (PVR) is a tumor promoter and a regulatory checkpoint that enhances immunosuppression. We investigated PVR expression by applying immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. A positive association existed between PVR expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) expression in patients with surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PVR expression is a prognosis predictor of lung adenocarcinoma.PurposeTo investigate the prognostic significance of PVR expression and CTLA4 expression for surgically resected NSCLC.Patients and methodsThe medical records of 108 Chinese patients with primary NSCLC who underwent surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of PVR and CTLA4 were measured through IHC. Clinical characteristics, the association between PVR and CTLA4, and the prognostic significance of PVR were analyzed.ResultsA significant positive association was observed between PVR and CTLA4 expression in NSCLC (P = 0.016). PVR had a high positive rate among females, nonsmokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma and advanced lung cancer. The overall survival (OS) of patients with negative PVR expression was significantly longer than that of patients with positive PVR expression (P = 0.049), especially among females (P = 0.03) and nonsmokers (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis results showed that advanced tumor stage and PVR expression were independent prognosis predictors of poor OS.ConclusionPVR can potentially serve as a prognostic predictor and biomarker for NSCLC and cancer anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03189-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a tropical disease that can be fatal if acute and untreated. Diagnosis is difficult, the treatment is toxic and prophylactic vaccines do not exist. Leishmania parasites express hundreds of proteins and several of them are relevant for the host's immune system. In this context, in the present study, 10 specific T-cell epitopes from 5 parasite proteins, which were identified by antibodies in VL patients’ sera, were selected and used to construct a gene codifying the new chimeric protein called rCHI. The rCHI vaccine was developed and thoroughly evaluated for its potential effectiveness against Leishmania infantum infection. We used monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and polymeric micelles (Mic) as adjuvant and/or delivery system. The results demonstrated that both rCHI/MPLA and rCHI/Mic significantly stimulate an antileishmanial Th1-type cellular response, with higher production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12 and nitrite in vaccinated animals, and this response was sustained after challenge. In addition, these mice significantly reduced the parasitism in internal organs and increased the production of IgG2a isotype antibodies. In vivo and in vitro toxicity showed that rCHI is safe for the mammalians, and the recombinant protein also induced in vitro lymphoproliferative response and production of Th1-type cytokines by human cells, which were collected from healthy subjects and treated VL patients. These data suggest rCHI plus MPLA or micelles could be considered as a vaccine candidate against VL.","AbstractBackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a strong risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing hospitalization for COVID-19 with VTE.MethodsAdults hospitalized at 21 sites between March 2021 and October 2022 with symptoms of acute respiratory illness were assessed for COVID-19, completion of the original monovalent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination series, and VTE. Prevalence of VTE was compared between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients with COVID-19. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was calculated using a test-negative design. The VE was also stratified by predominant circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant.ResultsAmong 18 811 patients (median age [interquartile range], 63 [50–73] years; 49% women; 59% non-Hispanic white, 20% non-Hispanic black, and 14% Hispanic; and median of 2 comorbid conditions [interquartile range, 1–3]), 9792 were admitted with COVID-19 (44% vaccinated), and 9019 were test-negative controls (73% vaccinated). Among patients with COVID-19, 601 had VTE diagnosed by hospital day 28, of whom 170 were vaccinated. VTE was more common among unvaccinated than vaccinated patients with COVID-19 (7.8% vs 4.0%; P = .001). The VE against COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE was 84% overall (95% confidence interval, 80%–87%), and VE stratified by predominant circulating variant was 88% (73%–95%) for Alpha, 93% (90%–95%) for Delta, and 68% (58%–76%) for Omicron variants.ConclusionsVaccination with the original monovalent mRNA series was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 hospitalization with VTE, though data detailing prior history of VTE and use of anticoagulation were not available. These findings will inform risk-benefit considerations for those considering vaccination.",1
"Purpose:Transcriptional profiling of pancreatic cancers (PC) has defined two main transcriptional subtypes, classical and basal. Initial data suggest shorter survival for patients with basal tumors and differing treatment sensitivity to FOLFIRINOX (FFX) and gemcitabine nab-Paclitaxel (GnP) by transcriptional subtype.Experimental Design:We examined 8,743 patients with RNA sequencing from PCs performed at Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ). Classical and basal subtypes were identified using PurIST algorithm on RNA-sequencing and two cohorts were analyzed:  Biomarker cohort included patients with complete molecular profiling data (n = 7,250);  Outcomes cohort included patients with metastatic disease with available survival outcomes (n=5,335). 3,842 patients were shared between the two cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess patient survival.Results:In the biomarker cohort, 3,063 tumors (42.2%) were strongly classical (SC), and 2,015 tumors (27.8%) were strongly basal (SB). SC and SB tumors showed strong associations with histologic phenotypes and biopsy site. SB tumors had higher rates of KRAS, TP53, and ARID1A mutations, lower rates of SMAD4 mutation, and transcriptional evidence of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Sixty of 77 cases (78%) maintained their transcriptional subtype between temporally and/or spatially disparate lesions. In the outcomes cohort, SB subtype was associated with shorter overall survival time, regardless of whether they received FFX or GnP as first line chemotherapy. Mutant KRAS allele type was prognostic of outcomes, however this impact was restricted to SC tumors, whereas all mutant KRAS alleles had similarly poor outcomes in SB tumors.Conclusions:SB subtype is a strong independent predictor of worse outcomes, irrespective of upfront chemotherapy regimen. Clinical trials should further investigate PC transcriptional subtypes as a prognostic and predictive biomarker.","PurposeChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has demonstrated clinical success in treating haematologic malignancies but has not been effective against solid tumours thus far. Trop2 is a tumour-related antigen broadly overexpressed on a variety of tumours and has been reported as a promising target for pancreatic cancers. Our study aimed to determine whether CAR T cells designed with a fully human Trop2-specific single-chain fragment variable (scFv) can be used in the treatment of Trop2-positive pancreatic tumours.MethodsWe designed Trop2-targeted chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells with a novel human anti-Trop2 scFv (2F11) and then investigated the cytotoxicity, degranulation, and cytokine secretion profiles of the anti-Trop2 CAR T cells when they were exposed to Trop2 + cancer cells in vitro. We also studied the antitumour efficacy and toxicity of Trop2-specific CAR T cells in vivo using a BxPC-3 pancreatic xenograft model.ResultsTrop2-targeted CAR T cells designed with 2F11 effectively killed Trop2-positive pancreatic cancer cells and produced high levels of cytotoxic cytokines in vitro. In addition, Trop2-targeted CAR T cells, which persistently circulate in vivo and efficiently infiltrate into tumour tissues, significantly blocked and even eliminated BxPC-3 pancreatic xenograft tumour growth without obvious deleterious effects observed after intravenous injection into NSG mice. Moreover, disease-free survival was efficiently prolonged.ConclusionThese results show that Trop2-targeted CAR T cells equipped with a fully human anti-Trop2 scFv could be a potential treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer and could be useful for clinical evaluation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04017-x.",1
"The pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is an essential component of the activation of the necroptotic pathway. Emerging evidence suggests that MLKL plays a key role in liver disease. However, how MLKL contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we report that MLKL is upregulated in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced murine HCC model and is associated with human hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocyte-specific MLKL knockout suppresses the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis. Conversely, MLKL overexpression aggravates the initiation and progression of DEN-induced HCC. Mechanistic study reveals that deletion of MLKL significantly increases the activation of autophagy, thereby protecting against hepatocarcinogenesis. MLKL directly interacts with AMPKα1 and inhibits its activity independent of its necroptotic function. Mechanistically, MLKL serves as a bridging molecule between AMPKα1 and protein phosphatase 1B (PPM1B), thus enhancing the dephosphorylation of AMPKα1. Consistently, MLKL expression correlates negatively with AMPKα1 phosphorylation in HCC patients. Taken together, our findings highlight MLKL as a novel AMPK gatekeeper that plays key roles in inhibiting autophagy and driving hepatocarcinogenesis, suggesting that the MLKL-AMPKα1 axis is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.","The pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is an essential component of the activation of the necroptotic pathway.

"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that has no therapeutic targets, relies on chemotherapeutics for treatment, and is in dire need of novel therapeutic approaches for improved patient outcomes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as intercellular communicators and have been proposed as ideal drug delivery vehicles. Here, EVs were engineered with RNA nanotechnology to develop TNBC tumor inhibitors. Using super resolved-structured illumination microscopy, EVs were optimized for precise Survivin small interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugated to chemotherapeutics loading and CD44 aptamer ligand decoration, thereby enhancing specificity toward TNBC cells. Conventional treatments typically employ chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine (GEM) and paclitaxel (PTX) at dosages on the order of mg/kg respectively, per injection (intravenous) in mice. In contrast, engineered EVs encapsulating these drugs saw functional tumor growth inhibition at significantly reduced concentrations: 2.2 μg/kg for GEM or 5.6 μg/kg for PTX, in combination with 21.5 μg/kg survivin-siRNA in mice. The result is a substantial decrease in the chemotherapeutic dose required, by orders of magnitude, compared with standard regimens. In vivo and in vitro evaluations in a TNBC orthotopic xenograft mouse model demonstrated the efficacy of this decreased dosage strategy, indicating the potential for decreased chemotherapy-associated toxicity.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is incurable and prone to widespread metastasis. Therefore, identification of key targets for TNBC progression is urgently needed. Our previous study revealed that isotoosendanin (ITSN) reduced TNBC metastasis by targeting TGFβR1. ITSN is currently used as an effective chemical probe to further discover the key molecules involved in TNBC metastasis downstream of TGFβR1. The results showed that GOT2 was the gene downstream of Smad2/3 and that ITSN decreased GOT2 expression by abrogating the activation of the TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling pathway through directly binding to TGFβR1. GOT2 was highly expressed in TNBC, and its knockdown decreased TNBC metastasis. However, GOT2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of ITSN on TNBC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. GOT2 interacted with MYH9 and hindered its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1, thereby reducing MYH9 ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, GOT2 also enhanced the translocation of MYH9 to mitochondria and thus induced DRP1 phosphorylation, thereby promoting mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells. ITSN-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation was associated with reduced GOT2 expression. In conclusion, ITSN prevented MYH9-regulated mitochondrial fission and lamellipodia formation in TNBC cells by enhancing MYH9 protein degradation through a reduction in GOT2 expression, thus contributing to its inhibition of TNBC metastasis.",1
"The goal of precision oncology is to translate the molecular features of cancer into predictive and prognostic tests that can be used to individualize treatment leading to improved outcomes and decreased toxicity. Success for this strategy in breast cancer is exemplified by efficacy of trastuzumab in tumors overexpressing ERBB2 and endocrine therapy for tumors that are estrogen receptor positive. However, other effective treatments, including chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and CDK4/6 inhibitors are not associated with strong predictive biomarkers. Proteomics promises another tier of information that, when added to genomic and transcriptomic features (proteogenomics), may create new opportunities to improve both treatment precision and therapeutic hypotheses. Here, we review both mass spectrometry-based and antibody-dependent proteomics as complementary approaches. We highlight how these methods have contributed toward a more complete understanding of breast cancer and describe the potential to guide diagnosis and treatment more accurately.","AbstractMelanoma, a type of cancer, has the ability to metastasize and can be fatal. The lack of success in the treatment of melanoma with chemotherapeutic agents and the side effects have led to the search for new agents. Moreover, developing systems that will provide reduce side effects by using biocompatible carriers, may be beneficial. Naringin (NAR), from Citrus plants, has anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. NAR is useful in formulations where it is used with a carrier due to its low water solubility and bioavailability with few toxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of NAR-loaded peptide based Fmoc-FF nanogels on human melanoma (SK-MEL-30) cells. Characterization of NAR-loaded Fmoc-FF nanogels was carried out. The biocompatibility properties of Fmoc-FF and NAR-loaded nanogels were evaluated in mouse fibroblast (L929) cells, and their cytotoxic effects were evaluated in human melanoma (SK-MEL-30) cells by the MTT method. While the DCF-DA method was used to measure the effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, the changes in oxidative stress biomarkers were examined by spectrophotometric analysis, tyrosinase enzyme activity and inflammation biomarkers were investigated by ELISA method. Comet method was used to evaluate antigenotoxic effects. It has been observed that loading NAR into Fmoc peptide gels may be effective in causing cytotoxic, genotoxic, anti-inflammatory and anti-tyrosinase effects and an increase in ROS release in melanoma cells. These results indicate that NAR-loaded Fmoc-FF gels, which have the feature of easy application to the skin, may be effective in the treatment of melanoma without causing toxic effects.",0
"PurposeImmunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.MethodsRNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.ResultsConsensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters (ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high infiltration of immune-active cells.ConclusionThis study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04555-4.","BackgroundAlthough targeted therapies and immunotherapy have achieved significant clinical benefits in patients with certain pathological types of lung cancer. However, prognosis for patients with lung adenocarcinoma still remains unsatisfactory. It is of extremely importance to find ideal prognostic indicators to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients, especially for patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the significance of Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1) and Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.MethodsIn this study, IGFR1 and VEGF-A expression on 119 specimens of patients early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed by immunohistochemistry with an H-score system.ResultsBoth high IGFR1 expression and VEGF-A expression patients were resulted in 59 (49.6%) separately. The numbers and proportions of IGFR1−&VEGF-A− subgroup, IGFR1−&VEGF-A+ subgroup, IGFR1+&VEGF-A− subgroup and IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ subgroup are 23 (19.3%), 37 (31.1%), 37 (31.1%) and 22 (18.5%) respectively. High IGFR1 expression was significantly associated with both poor PFS and OS of all patients in a univariate analysis. Multivariable analysis showed that patients with IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ expression exhibited a worst PFS and OS in the subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutation.ConclusionsThese results suggest that IGFR1+&VEGF-A+ is expected to be a disadvantageous factor for prognosis in the subgroup of EGFR mutation in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. What’s more, this study may provide the theoretical possibility to screen optimal population for a combination therapy with anti-VEGF and anti-IGFR1 in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05371-0.",1
"AbstractIntroductionHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) holds high cancer mortality worldwide. Immunotherapy-based combination therapy, currently the first-line (1L) standard of care in advanced HCC, has shifted the treatment paradigm concerning both efficacy and safety outcomes. Data on immune-related adverse event surrogacy for efficacy outcomes are mixed.Case ReportWe report the case of a 58-year-old male with chronic hepatitis C virus infection who presented with a voluminous shoulder HCC metastasis. Albeit an initial significant biochemical response with 1L sorafenib, progressive disease after 3 months plus a bleeding complication led to treatment discontinuation. Second-line nivolumab, although yielding a rapid clinical and biochemical response, was permanently ceased after 12 weeks due to a grade 3 immune-related hepatitis. Notably, 5 years post-treatment, the patient sustains a major biochemical and radiographic response.DiscussionThis case highlights an unusual and sustained response to nivolumab treatment in HCC, following early treatment discontinuation due to severe hepatotoxicity.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the sixth most common malignancy but the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. Significant breakthroughs have been made in systemic treatment for HCC over the past two decades, which have improved treatment outcomes. In addition to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (mTKIs), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic drugs are increasingly being applied. The combination of ICI and antiangiogenic or dual ICIs has become the new standard of care due to remarkable response rates. However, currently available systemic regimens are primarily reserved for certain patients in the intermediate and advanced stages who will not benefit from locoregional treatments. Evidence supporting the use of systemic treatment as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies in patients with early-stage HCC, especially the high risk of recurrence after curative treatments, remains limited. This review identified recent developments in systemic therapy, including mTKIs and ICIs, considering results on first- and second-line treatment, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and combination with loco-regional therapy. Various ongoing clinical trials regarding the role of systemic therapies and potential novel targets in patients with early-, intermediate-, and advanced-stage HCC were also summarized and revealed that systemic therapy is no longer limited to advanced-stage HCC. Moreover, the introduction of T-cell redirecting strategies, including bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, has revolutionized the treatment landscape for HCC. Future research should focus on an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms governing the establishment of tumor barriers.",1
"AbstractThe incidence of tumors increases significantly in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly among those undergoing dialysis. This dialysis-associated condition not only impacts therapy but also influences the prognosis of oncological patients, contributing to heightened mortality rates related to both cancer and non-cancer causes. Importantly, it stands as a primary factor leading to suboptimal utilization of therapies. Dosage adjustment for many types of chemotherapy is a necessity in patients with kidney impairment. However, due to a lack of comprehensive knowledge about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs in dialysis, adjustments are often made empirically, and in many cases, chemotherapy is avoided altogether. In this review, we highlight the current challenges and gaps in knowledge, and emphasize the imperative need for dedicated research to establish evidence-based guidelines for chemotherapy management in this vulnerable patient population.Graphical abstract","Purpose:This study aimed to compare accuracy and efficiency of a convolutional neural network (CNN)–enhanced workflow for pancreas segmentation versus radiologists in the context of interreader reliability.Methods:Volumetric pancreas segmentations on a data set of 294 portal venous computed tomographies were performed by 3 radiologists (R1, R2, and R3) and by a CNN. Convolutional neural network segmentations were reviewed and, if needed, corrected (“corrected CNN [c-CNN]” segmentations) by radiologists. Ground truth was obtained from radiologists’ manual segmentations using simultaneous truth and performance level estimation algorithm. Interreader reliability and model’s accuracy were evaluated with Dice-Sorenson coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard coefficient (JC). Equivalence was determined using a two 1-sided test. Convolutional neural network segmentations below the 25th percentile DSC were reviewed to evaluate segmentation errors. Time for manual segmentation and c-CNN was compared.Results:Pancreas volumes from 3 sets of segmentations (manual, CNN, and c-CNN) were noninferior to simultaneous truth and performance level estimation–derived volumes [76.6 cm3 (20.2 cm3), P < 0.05]. Interreader reliability was high (mean [SD] DSC between R2-R1, 0.87 [0.04]; R3-R1, 0.90 [0.05]; R2-R3, 0.87 [0.04]). Convolutional neural network segmentations were highly accurate (DSC, 0.88 [0.05]; JC, 0.79 [0.07]) and required minimal-to-no corrections (c-CNN: DSC, 0.89 [0.04]; JC, 0.81 [0.06]; equivalence, P < 0.05). Undersegmentation (n = 47 [64%]) was common in the 73 CNN segmentations below 25th percentile DSC, but there were no major errors. Total inference time (minutes) for CNN was 1.2 (0.3). Average time (minutes) taken by radiologists for c-CNN (0.6 [0.97]) was substantially lower compared with manual segmentation (3.37 [1.47]; savings of 77.9%–87% [P < 0.0001]).Conclusions:Convolutional neural network–enhanced workflow provides high accuracy and efficiency for volumetric pancreas segmentation on computed tomography.",0
"Even though both targeted and immunotherapy-based therapies have been established as frontline standard-of-care for patients with advanced lung cancer, adverse events, resistance, and disease progression remain unavoidable in most instances. In this scenario, chemotherapy is a popular salvage option, but it has restricted therapeutic index. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a viable option. ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy to deliver cytotoxic payloads to cancer cells in a direct fashion. Among the promising ADCs used in advanced solid tumors, HER2 targeted ADCs of trastuzumab ematansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan are key drugs in this field.","Little is known about the mutational landscape of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and predictive biomarkers of response to systemic therapies are lacking. We aimed to describe the mutational landscape of advanced HCC and to identify predictors of primary resistance to systemic therapies using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). We prospectively enrolled 121 patients between October 2015 and January 2019. We performed targeted ultra-deep sequencing of 25 genes and Digital Droplet PCR of TERT promoter, including sequential samples throughout treatment. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) stratified by mutation profiles in ctDNA. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and objective response rate. The most frequent mutations in ctDNA of advanced HCC were TERT promoter (51%), TP53 (32%), CTNNB1 (17%), PTEN (8%), AXIN1, ARID2, KMT2D, and TSC2 (each 6%). TP53 and CTNNB1 mutations were mutually exclusive. Patients with mutations in the PI3K/MTOR pathway had significantly shorter PFS than those without these mutations after tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2.1 vs 3.7 months, p < 0.001), but not after immune checkpoint inhibition (CPI). WNT pathway mutations were not associated with PFS, overall survival, or objective response after CPI. Serial profiling of ctDNA in a subset correlated with treatment response. Mutation profiling of ctDNA in advanced HCC shows similar mutation frequencies for known HCC drivers compared to early stages and identifies predictive biomarkers of response to systemic therapies.",0
"Aptamers, synthetic single-strand oligonucleotides with a similar function to antibodies, are promising as therapeutics because of their minimal side effects. However, the stability and bioavailability of the aptamers pose a challenge. We developed aptamers converted from RNA aptamer to modified DNA aptamers targeting phospho-AXL with improved stability and bioavailability.Based on the comparative analysis of a library of 17 converted modified DNA aptamers, we selected aptamer candidates, GLB-G25 and GLB-A04 that exhibited highest bioavailability, stability and robust anti-tumor effect in vitro experiments.Backbone modifications such as thiophosphate or dithiophosphate and a covalent modification of the 5’-end of the aptamer with polyethylene glycol optimized the pharmacokinetic properties, improved the stability of the aptamers in vivo by reducing nuclease hydrolysis and renal clearance, and achieved high and sustained inhibition of AXL at a very low dose.Treatment with these modified aptamers in ovarian cancer orthotopic mouse models significantly reduced tumor growth and the number of metastases. This effective silencing of the phospho-AXL target thus demonstrated that aptamer specificity and bioavailability can be improved by chemical modification of existing aptamers for phospho-AXL. These results lay the foundation for translation of these aptamer candidates and companion biomarkers to the clinic.","Objective:This study aimed to assess reporting quality of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the head and neck oncology literature using the TRIPOD-AI criteria.Data Sources:A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, incorporating search terms related to “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “deep learning,” “neural network,” and various head and neck neoplasms.Review Methods:Two independent reviewers analyzed each published study for adherence to the 65-point TRIPOD-AI criteria. Items were classified as “Yes,” “No,” or “NA” for each publication. The proportion of studies satisfying each TRIPOD-AI criterion was calculated. Additionally, the evidence level for each study was evaluated independently by two reviewers using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) Levels of Evidence. Discrepancies were reconciled through discussion until consensus was reached.Results:The study highlights the need for improvements in ML algorithm reporting in head and neck oncology. This includes more comprehensive descriptions of datasets, standardization of model performance reporting, and increased sharing of ML models, data, and code with the research community. Adoption of TRIPOD-AI is necessary for achieving standardized ML research reporting in head and neck oncology.Conclusion:Current reporting of ML algorithms hinders clinical application, reproducibility, and understanding of the data used for model training. To overcome these limitations and improve patient and clinician trust, ML developers should provide open access to models, code, and source data, fostering iterative progress through community critique, thus enhancing model accuracy and mitigating biases.",0
"AbstractOver recent decades, in vitro and in vivo models have significantly advanced brain cancer research; however, each presents distinct challenges for accurately mimicking in situ conditions. In response, organotypic slice cultures have emerged as a promising model recapitulating precisely specific in vivo phenotypes through an ex vivo approach. Ex vivo organotypic brain slice models can integrate biological relevance and patient-specific variability early in drug discovery, thereby aiming for more precise treatment stratification. However, the challenges of obtaining representative fresh brain tissue, ensuring reproducibility, and maintaining essential central nervous system (CNS)-specific conditions reflecting the in situ situation over time have limited the direct application of ex vivo organotypic slice cultures in robust clinical trials. In this review, we explore the benefits and possible limitations of ex vivo organotypic brain slice cultures in neuro-oncological research. Additionally, we share insights from clinical experts in neuro-oncology on how to overcome these current limitations and improve the practical application of organotypic brain slice cultures beyond academic research.","AbstractBackgroundThe discovery of glioblastoma (GBM)-initiating cells (GICs) has impacted GBM research. These cells are not only tumorigenic but also exhibit resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize GICs thoroughly and identify new therapeutic targets. In a previous study, we successfully identified epithelial-V–like antigen 1 (EVA1) as a novel functional factor specific to GICs.MethodsHybridoma cells were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with EVA1-Fc fusion protein. The reactivity of the supernatant from these hybridoma cells was examined using EVA1-overexpressing cells and GICs. Candidate antibodies were further selected using Biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis and 2 cytotoxicity assays—antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Among the antibodies, the cytotoxicity of the B2E5-antibody drug conjugate (B2E5-ADC) was evaluated by both adding it to cultured GICs and injecting it into GIC tumor-bearing brains.ResultsB2E5 demonstrated a high affinity for human EVA1 and effectively killed both EVA1-expressing cell lines and GICs in culture through ADCC and CDC. B2E5-ADC also exhibited strong cytotoxicity to GICs in culture and prevented their tumorigenesis in the brain when administered intracranially to the tumor-bearing brain.ConclusionOur data indicate that B2E5-ADC is a new and promising therapeutic strategy for GBM.",1
"PurposeTo investigate whether attenuated Toxoplasma is efficacious against solid tumors of pancreatic cancer and whether attenuated Toxoplasma improves the antitumor activity of αPD-1 antibody on pancreatic cancer.MethodsThe therapeutic effects of attenuated Toxoplasma NRTUA strain monotherapy and combination therapy of NRTUA with anti-PD-1 antibody on PDAC tumor volume and tumor weight of Pan02 tumor-bearing mice were investigated. We characterized the effects of combination therapy of NRTUA with anti-PD-1 antibody on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-specific IFN-γ by using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and ELISA. The antitumor mechanisms of combination therapy of NRTUA with anti-PD-1 antibody were investigated via depletion of CD8+ T cells and IL-12.ResultsNRTUA strain treatment inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous mouse model of PDAC through activating dendritic cells and increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. More importantly, combination therapy of NRTUA with anti-PD-1 antibody elicited a significant antitumor immune response and synergistically controlled tumor growth in Pan02 tumor-bearing mice. Specifically, the combination treatment led to elevation of CD8+ T cell infiltration mediated by dendritic cell-secreted IL-12 and to tumor-specific IFN-γ production in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Also, the combination treatment markedly reduced the immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cell population in PDAC mice.ConclusionThese findings could provide a novel immunotherapy approach to treating solid tumors of PDAC and overcoming resistance to anti-PD-1 agents in PDAC tumors.","Chronic systemic inflammation significantly increases myocardial infarction risk in people living with HIV (PLWH). Endothelial cell dysfunction disrupts vascular homeostasis regulation, increasing the risk of vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis, contributing to cardiovascular disease. We aimed to characterize endothelial cell (EC) chemokines, cytokine and chemokine receptors of PLWH, hypothesizing that in our cohort, glucose intolerance contributes to their differential expression implicated in endothelial dysfunction. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we phenotyped chemokine, chemokine, and cytokine receptor expression on arterial ECs, capillary ECs, venous ECs, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 59 PLWH with and without glucose intolerance. Our results show that arterial and capillary ECs express significantly higher interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors than venous ECs and VSMCs. Venous ECs exhibited more interleukin (IL)1R1 and ACKR1 receptors, and VSMCs showed significant IL6R expression than arterial and capillary ECs. When stratified by group, arterial ECs from PLWH with glucose intolerance expressed significantly higher IL1R1, IL6R, CXCL12, CCL14, and ICAM2 transcripts than arterial ECs from PLWH without diabetes. Of the different vascular cell types studied, arterial ECs as a proportion of all ECs in adipose tissue were positively correlated with plasma fasting blood glucose. In contrast, venous ECs and VSMCs were positively correlated with plasma IL6. To directly assess the effect of plasma from PLWH on endothelial function, we cultured human arterial ECs (HAECs) in plasma-conditioned media from PLWH and performed bulk RNA sequencing. Plasma from PLWH stimulated ECs with the upregulation of genes that enrich for the oxidative phosphorylation and the TNF-α via NFK-β pathways. In conclusion, ECs in PLWH show heterogeneous cytokine and chemokine receptor expression, and arterial ECs were the most influenced by glucose intolerance. Further research must explicate cytokine and chemokine roles in EC dysfunction and identify biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response.",0
"Undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHPS) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma (STS) originated from mesenchyme. UHPS is mostly advanced, aggressive and has poor prognosis. Patients with UHPS tend to have a lower 5-year survival rate than patients with other types of STS. NTRK fusions are commonly found in rare histological tumor types. Among sarcomas, 90% of infantile fibrosarcomas have NTRK fusions. Many other types of sarcomas have also been studied for NTRK fusions. Targeted therapy with NTRK inhibitors, such as Larotrectinib and Entrectinib, leads to response in most patients with NTRK1/2/3 gene fusion-positive tumors. Herein, we present a 68-years old man with UHPS by pathological diagnosis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a novel TMTC2-NTRK3 fusion, which was also detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This report broadens the spectrum of NTRK fusions in UHPS and highlights a new target for treatment.","PurposeExisting biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.MethodsAn animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.ResultsWe identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes (RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and metastasis.ConclusionThe model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04495-z.",0
"AbstractBACKGROUNDImmunotherapy (IT) has gained increased significance as a systemic therapy option in the management of various types of metastatic cancer, including cases involving brain metastases (BMs). The differential diagnosis of progressive/relapsed BMs and treatment-related changes (TRC) is often based on imaging with amino acid (AA) PET, in addition to standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as this has been established to provide higher diagnostic accuracy. However, diagnostic value of the AA-PET in the context of IT has not been studied so far. In this pilot study we quantified diagnostic accuracy of AA PET in patients with suspected progressive BMs under IT. MATERIAL AND METHODSThis retrospective study included patients with suspected progressive/relapsed BMs on MRI after radiotherapy (RT) between 04/2007 - 01/2023. Only patients with AA PET ≤ 4 weeks prior to surgery/biopsy of BMs were selected. AA PET results were compared with histopathological findings and distinctive features were highlighted. RESULTSOut of 29 patients, 7 were treated with IT (IT+ group). Remaining patients (IT- group) were treated with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, a combination of both, or obtained no systemic therapy before PET. The groups did not differ regarding age, gender, initial number of BMs or time interval between PET and last RT. In the IT+ group, 6 patients had malignant melanoma and 1 patient urothelial carcinoma as primary tumor. The IT+ patients obtained ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab, sequentially, or in combination. In the IT+ and IT- group, 7 and 21 PET scans were read as suspicious for progressive/relapsed BMs, respectively. The rate of false-positive findings was 5/7 (71.4%) and 3/21 (14.3%), respectively (chi square test, p=0.008). Histopathological analyses revealed an inflammatory reaction with lymphocytic infiltrates in the examined tissue in the IT+ group. CONCLUSIONThere is a significantly higher rate of false-positive AA PET findings in patients with BMs who have been treated with IT. This observation may be explained by an immunologically mediated inflammatory reaction. Further immunological analyses of lymphocytic infiltrates could provide more information.In conclusion, until more data are available, caution should be exercised when diagnosing tumor recurrence using AA PET in patients who have previously received IT.","Gastric malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are extremely rare spindle cell sarcomas that arise within the peripheral nerves of the gastrointestinal tract. MPNST can present as a mass that may or may not be accompanied by obstruction or bleeding. Type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an incidence of 1 in 2,500-3,000. Plexiform neurofibromas in Type 1 NF can undergo a malignant transformation to MPNSTs. Approximately half of the incidence of MPNST is associated with the NF-1 gene. MPNST behaves aggressively, and radical excisional surgery is important for treatment. Recurrence and metastasis are significant, even after a radical excision. Despite multidisciplinary treatment, the five-year survival rate is only 30-50%. This paper reports the case of a 47-year-old man with Type 1 NF who presented with hemorrhage of a gastric subepithelial lesion. He underwent surgery under the suspicion of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, but it was diagnosed as MPNST after confirming the histopathological appearance and immunohistochemical profiles. In addition, the large mass invaded the spleen and diaphragm. Radical surgery was performed, and additional chemotherapy was administered. This paper reports the experience of a patient with NF 1 with advanced MPNST discovered due to a subepithelial lesion.",0
"AbstractBreast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. The difficulties with anticancer medications, such as ineffective targeting, larger doses, toxicity to healthy cells and side effects, have prompted attention to alternate approaches to address these difficulties. RNA interference by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is one such tactic. When compared with chemotherapy, siRNA has several advantages, including the ability to quickly modify and suppress the expression of the target gene and display superior efficacy and safety. However, there are known challenges and hurdles that limits their clinical translation. Decomposition by endonucleases, renal clearance, hydrophilicity, negative surface charge, short half-life and off-target effects of naked siRNA are obstacles that hinder the desired biological activity of naked siRNA. Nanoparticulate systems such as polymeric, lipid, lipid-polymeric, metallic, mesoporous silica nanoparticles and several other nanocarriers were used for effective delivery of siRNA and to knock down genes involved in breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. The focus of this review is to provide a comprehensive picture of various strategies utilized for delivering siRNA, such as combinatorial delivery, development of modified nanoparticles, smart nanocarriers and nanocarriers that target angiogenesis, cancer stem cells and metastasis of breast cancer.","ABSTRACTOvarian cancer remains one of the main causes of human mortality, accounting for millions of deaths every year. Despite of several clinical options such as chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), hormonal treatment, radiation therapy, and surgery to manage this disease, the mortality rate is still very high. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for innovative approaches to improve both diagnosis and treatment. Success stories of iron oxide nanoparticles, that is Ferucarbotran (Resovist®) and Ferrixan (Cliavist®) for liver imaging, CNS (Central nervous system) imaging, cell labeling, etc. have motivated researchers to explore these nanocarriers for treatment and diagnosis of different diseases. Iron oxide nanoparticles have improved the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs through targeted delivery, heat/ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation on application of external energy and have also shown great potential as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their unique magnetic properties enable sensitive imaging, and surface modification allows the attachment of specific biomolecules for targeted detection of ovarian cancer cells. Their unique properties, viz. magnetic responsiveness and surface functionalization, make them versatile tools for enhancing both imaging and therapeutic outcomes. Present article reviews the literature on the synthesis, functionalization, and applications of iron oxide nanoparticles in management of ovarian cancer.",0
"Currently, there are two approved vaccine regimens designed to prevent Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD). Both are virus-vectored, and concerns about cold-chain storage and pre-existing immunity to the vectors warrant investigating additional vaccine strategies. Here, we have explored the utility of adjuvanted recombinant glycoproteins (GPs) from ebolaviruses Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and Bundibugyo (BDBV) for inducing antibody (Ab) and T cell cross-reactivity. Glycoproteins expressed in insect cells were administered to C57BL/6 mice as free protein or bound to the surface of liposomes, and formulated with toll-like receptor agonists CpG and MPLA (agonists for TLR 9 and 4, respectively), with or without the emulsions AddaVax or TiterMax. The magnitude of Ab cross-reactivity in binding and neutralization assays, and T cell cross-reactivity in antigen recall assays, correlated with phylogenetic relatedness. While most adjuvants screened induced IgG responses, a combination of CpG, MPLA and AddaVax emulsion (“IVAX-1”) was the most potent and polarized in an IgG2c (Th1) direction. Breadth was also achieved by combining GPs into a trivalent (Tri-GP) cocktail with IVAX-1, which did not compromise antibody responses to individual components in binding and neutralizing assays. Th1 signature cytokines in T cell recall assays were undetectable after Tri-GP/IVAX-1 administration, despite a robust IgG2c response, although administration of Tri-GP on lipid nanoparticles in IVAX-1 elevated Th1 cytokines to detectable levels. Overall, the data indicate an adjuvanted trivalent recombinant GP approach may represent a path toward a broadly reactive, deployable vaccine against EVD.","BackgroundCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a prominent cancer-related complication occurring in Prostate cancer (PCa) patients, profoundly affecting prognosis. The lack of diagnostic criteria and biomarkers hampers the management of CRF.MethodsThe CRF-related data and PCa single-cell data were retrieved from the GEO database and clinical data was downloaded from the TCGA database. The univariate logistic/Cox regression analysis were used to construct the prediction models. The predictive value of models was analyzed using the ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier survival. The hub genes were screened by an intersection analysis of DEGs. The mice model of PCa and PCa-related fatigue were established, and fatigue-like behaviors of mice were detected. The expression of selected hub genes was validated by RT-PCR and IHC analysis.ResultsThe diagnosis and risk models showed great predictive value both in the training and validation dataset. Five genes (Baiap2l2, Cacng4, Sytl2, Sec31b and Ms4a1) that enriched the CXCL signaling were identified as hub genes. Among all hub genes, the MS4A1 expression is the most significant in PCa-related fatigue mice.ConclusionsWe identified MS4A1 as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of PCa-related fatigue. Our findings would lay a foundation for revealing the pathogenesis and developing therapies for PCa-related fatigue.",0
"Circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary strategy in cancer immunotherapy, facilitating novel approaches to induce robust and durable immune responses. Unlike traditional linear messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development. This review delved into the fundamental principles underlying circRNA biology, highlighting their unique structural advantages and translational potential. We examined recent advancements in circRNA vaccine design, focusing on their application in oncology. As the circRNA-based cancer vaccine is a relatively novel technology, findings from all the major studies describing its efficacy were discussed. We further investigated their combination with other immunotherapeutic modalities, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies, that ensure the maximal anticancer effects of circRNA vaccines. Large-scale manufacturing, immunogenicity optimization, delivery systems, and other challenges and future directions in this field were also discussed. This study aims to thoroughly analyze the state-of-the-art and potential future applications of circRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy, highlighting them as exciting possibilities for next-generation cancer therapies.","SUMMARYThe success of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 mRNA vaccines to lessen/prevent severe COVID-19 opened new opportunities to develop RNA vaccines to fight other infectious agents. HIV-1 is a lentivirus that integrates into the host cell genome and persists for the lifetime of infected cells. Multiple mechanisms of immune evasion have posed significant obstacles to the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine over the last four decades since the identification of HIV-1. Recently, attempts to address some of these challenges have led to multiple studies that manufactured, optimized, and tested, in different animal models, mRNA-based HIV-1 vaccines. Several clinical trials have also been initiated or are planned to start soon. Here, we review the current strategies applied to HIV-1 mRNA vaccines, discuss different targeting approaches, summarize the latest findings, and offer insights into the challenges and future of HIV-1 mRNA vaccines.",1
"AbstractBackgroundEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ and EBV- primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) carry distinct mutational landscapes, but their transcriptional and epigenetic profiles have not been integrated and compared. This precludes further insights into pathobiology and molecular differences, relevant for classification and targeted therapy.MethodsTwenty-three EBV- and 15 EBV+ PCNSL, histologically classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, were subjected to RNA-sequencing and EPIC methylation arrays. Unsupervised clustering analyses were performed. Differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes were identified and integrated.ResultsTwo distinct transcriptional clusters were found, which separated EBV- and EBV+ PCNSL (P < .0001). The EBV+ transcriptional signature contained genes (GPR15, FCER2/CD23, SLAMF1/CD150) closely regulated by EBV oncogenes in B cells. Pathway enrichment analysis uncovered enhanced B-cell receptor (BCR) and WNT/beta-catenin signaling in EBV- lymphomas, whereas Interleukin-10, NOTCH, and viral life cycle pathways were upregulated in EBV+ PCNSL. Correspondingly, BCR-associated SYK kinase activity was enriched in EBV- tumors while JAK2 was overrepresented in EBV+ PCNSL. Epigenetic profiling revealed reduced global promoter methylation in EBV+ PCNSL. Two methylation clusters were recognized, which separated EBV- and EBV+ PCNSL (P < .0001). Epigenetic profiles were distinct from 2,788 other brain tumor and nonmalignant reference samples. Promoter region hypermethylation of CD79B, a BCR subunit critical for sustained proliferation in EBV- disease, highly correlated (R = −0.7) with its transcriptional downregulation in EBV+ PCNSL.ConclusionsEBV+ and EBV- PCNSL harbor distinct transcriptional and epigenetic profiles, corroborating them as distinctive biological subtypes. Uncovered differences provide novel insights into their pathobiology, may guide molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies.","One of the main challenges in cancer treatment is the selection of treatment resistant clones which leads to the emergence of resistance to previously efficacious therapies. Identifying vulnerabilities in the form of cellular trade-offs constraining the phenotypic possibility space could allow to avoid the emergence of resistance by simultaneously targeting cellular processes that are involved in different alternative phenotypic strategies linked by trade-offs. The Pareto optimality theory has been proposed as a framework allowing to identify such trade-offs in biological data from its prediction that it would lead to the presence of specific geometrical patterns (polytopes) in, for example, gene expression space, with vertices representing specialized phenotypes. We tested this approach in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) transcriptomic data. As predicted, there was highly statistically significant evidence for the data forming a tetrahedron in gene expression space, defining four specialized phenotypes (archetypes). These archetypes were significantly enriched in certain biological functions, and contained genes that formed a pattern of shared and unique elements among archetypes, as expected if trade-offs between essential functions underlie the observed structure. The results can be interpreted as reflecting trade-offs between aerobic energy production and protein synthesis, and between immunotolerant and immune escape strategies. Targeting genes on both sides of these trade-offs simultaneously represent potential promising avenues for therapeutic applications.",1
"ABSTRACTThe release of active agents in tumors rather than normal tissues, limits systemic exposure and toxicities. Targeting over-expressed esterase enzyme in the tumor microenvironment can selectively release immune-active agents like Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand inhibitors from ester-sensitive lipid nanocarriers, offering a novel approach compared with conventional therapies. PD-1 and PD-L1 association cause T-cell inactivation, whereas blocking their association improves their cytotoxic mechanism. The patent application US2022/0080051-A1 discloses a novel immune-active agent conjugated with lipid to form a nanocarrier for esterase-sensitive release. These nanocarriers selectively enter leaky vasculature of tumors through enhanced permeability and retention effect, undergo ester cleavage to release agents, and are reported to increase bioavailability by 24 times. Further, with other agents or alone it achieves targeted synergistic cancer therapy. Also, the current patent spotlight delves into the crucial formulation considerations necessary for obtaining successful approval of lipidic nano products from relevant regulatory authorities.","BackgroundG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to have an important role in tumor development and metastasis, and abnormal expression of GPCRs is significantly associated with poor prognosis of tumor patients. In this study, we analyzed the GPCRs-related gene (GPRGs) and tumor microenvironment (TME) in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) to construct a prognostic model to help SKCM patients obtain accurate clinical treatment strategies.MethodsSKCM expression data and clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Differential expression analysis, LASSO algorithm, and univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were used to screen prognosis-related genes (GPR19, GPR146, S1PR2, PTH1R, ADGRE5, CXCR3, GPR143, and OR2I1P) and multiple prognosis-good immune cells; the data set was analyzed according to above results and build up a GPR-TME classifier. The model was further subjected to immune infiltration, functional enrichment, tumor mutational load, immunotherapy prediction, and scRNA-seq data analysis. Finally, cellular experiments were conducted to validate the functionality of the key gene GPR19 in the model.ResultsThe findings indicate that high expression of GPRGs is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with SKCM, highlighting the significant role of GPRGs and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in SKCM development. Notably, the group characterized by low GPR expression and a high TME exhibited the most favorable prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, cellular assays demonstrated that knockdown of GPR19 significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasive capabilities of melanoma cells in A375 and A2058 cell lines.ConclusionThis study provides novel insights for the prognosis evaluation and treatment of melanoma, along with the identification of a new biomarker, GPR19.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05486-4.",1
"Bispecific antibodies are an important tool for the management and treatment of acute leukemias. As a next step toward clinical translation of engineered plasma cells, we describe approaches for secretion of bispecific antibodies by human plasma cells. We show that human plasma cells expressing either fragment crystallizable domain-deficient anti-CD19 × anti-CD3 (blinatumomab) or anti-CD33 × anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies mediate T cell activation and direct T cell killing of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro. We demonstrate that knockout of the self-expressed antigen, CD19, boosts anti-CD19-bispecific secretion by plasma cells and prevents self-targeting. Plasma cells secreting anti-CD19-bispecific antibodies elicited in vivo control of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived xenografts in immunodeficient mice co-engrafted with autologous T cells. In these studies, we found that leukemic control elicited by engineered plasma cells was similar to CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells. Finally, the steady-state concentration of anti-CD19 bispecifics in serum 1 month after cell delivery and tumor eradication was comparable with that observed in patients treated with a steady-state infusion of blinatumomab. These findings support further development of ePCs for use as a durable delivery system for the treatment of acute leukemias, and potentially other cancers.","Background and Clinical Significance: Radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) following immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has been infrequently reported. Case Presentation: We present a 47-year-old female patient who developed RRD of the breast following three doses of pembrolizumab administered as an adjuvant treatment post-nephrectomy for Stage III renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Notably, the affected breast had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy 247 weeks earlier for Stage IA invasive ductal carcinoma. She had received no prior chemotherapy at any point. RRD manifested as breast induration, erythema, and peau d’orange, and contraction of breast volume was noted following three cycles of pembrolizumab on week 17 (400 mg dose every 6 weeks). The dermatitis responded rapidly to systemic corticosteroids and no treatment interruption was needed. Conclusions: To date, this is the longest reported interval from completion of radiotherapy to RRD. A literature search underscores the variability in presentation and management of ICI-associated RRD.",0
"AbstractDrug resistance remains a major obstacle in cancer treatment, leading to treatment failures and high mortality rates. Despite advancements in therapies, overcoming resistance requires a deeper understanding of its mechanisms. This review highlights CDK2's pivotal role in both intrinsic and acquired resistance, and its potential as a therapeutic target. Cyclin E upregulation, which partners with CDK2, is linked to poor prognosis and resistance across various cancers. Specifically, amplifications of CCNE1/CCNE2 are associated with resistance to targeted therapies, immunotherapy, endocrine therapies and chemo/radiotherapy. Given CDK2's involvement in resistance mechanisms, investigating its role presents promising opportunities for developing novel strategies to combat resistance and improve treatment outcomes.","A significant clinical challenge in lung cancer treatment is management of the inevitable acquired resistance to third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs), such as osimertinib, which have shown remarkable success in the treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations, in order to achieve maximal response duration or treatment remission. Apoptosis is a major type of programmed cell death tightly associated with cancer development and treatment. Evasion of apoptosis is considered a key hallmark of cancer and acquisition of apoptosis resistance is accordingly a key mechanism of drug acquired resistance in cancer therapy. It has been clearly shown that effective induction of apoptosis is a key mechanism for third generation EGFR-TKIs, particularly osimertinib, to exert their therapeutic efficacies and the development of resistance to apoptosis is tightly associated with the emergence of acquired resistance. Hence, restoration of cell sensitivity to undergo apoptosis using various means promises an effective strategy for the management of acquired resistance to third generation EGFR-TKIs.",0
"BackgroundThis study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MethodsElectronic databases were scanned to identify relevant trials. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and their prognostic factors. Stratified analyses were accomplished on ICIs agent and evaluation criteria.ResultsTotally, 3697 individuals from 40 cohorts were recruited. For patients treated with ICIs, the pooled median time to progression (TTP) was 8.0 months, median PFS 4.9 months, and median OS 12.0 months; the pooled median PFS and OS of ICIs plus anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents (PFS: 6.3 months, OS: 16.4 months) were longer than those of ICIs alone. Furthermore, Child–Pugh stage (HR = 1.37, P = 0.0123) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (HR = 1.40, P = 0.0016) were prognostic factors for PFS. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0356), Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR = 1.17, P < 0.0001), Child–Pugh stage (HR = 1.58, P < 0.0001), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (HR = 1.23, P = 0.0005), ECOG (HR = 1.50, P = 0.0012), portal vein invasion (HR = 1.32, P = 0.0053), extrahepatic metastasis (HR = 0.84, P = 0.0047), best response (HR = 0.58, P < 0.0001), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (HR = 1.23, P = 0.0451) were the prognostic factors for OS. According to both RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) rate of ICIs plus anti-VEGF agents were better than those of ICIs alone. The overall rate of any grade adverse events (AEs) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.61–0.89), grade 3 or higher AEs was 0.28 (95% CI 0.15–0.42), and the rate of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 0.09 (95% CI 0.06–0.12).ConclusionsThe ICIs was promising in HCC with good efficacy and tolerated toxicity. Compared with ICIs monotherapy, the joint application of ICIs and anti-VEGF agents can contribute a lot more benefits to the survival of patients according to clinical practices.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03716-1.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated myocarditis is a rare but severe complication for patients treated with immunotherapy. This study aims to explore the predictive significance of patients’ clinical features and examination results for the severity of ICI-associated myocarditis.MethodsData from a real-world cohort of 81 cancer patients who developed ICI-associated myocarditis after immunotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. The development of myocarditis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3–5 and/or the major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was set as endpoints. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive value of each factor.ResultsCTCAE grades 3–5 and MACE developed in 43/81 (53.1%) and 28/81 (34.6%) cases, respectively. The likelihood of CTCAE grades 3–5 and MACE increased with the accumulation of organs affected by the ICI-associated adverse events and initial clinical symptoms. Concurrent systematic therapies during ICI treatment did not raise the risk of myocarditis severity, while prior chemotherapy did. Besides classical serum cardiac markers, a higher neutrophil ratio was also related to poorer cardiac outcomes, whereas higher lymphocyte and monocyte ratios were predictors of favorable cardiac outcomes. The CD4+ T cell ratio and CD4/CD8 ratio were negatively related to CTCAE grades 3–5. Several cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters were associated with myocarditis severity, whereas the predictive value of echocardiography and electrocardiogram was weak.ConclusionThis study comprehensively evaluated the prognostic value of patients’ clinical characteristics and examination results and identified several predictors of severe ICI-associated myocarditis, which will facilitate early detection of severe ICI-associated myocarditis in patients receiving immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04782-3.",1
"AbstractThe clinical approval of platinum‐based drugs has prompted the development of novel metallo‐complexes during the last several decades, while severe problems, especially for poor water solubility, drug resistance and toxicity in patients, greatly hindered the clinical trials and curative efficacy. To address these issues, the concept of metallo‐prodrugs has been proposed for oncology. Some stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs provide new insights for designing and preparing site‐specific prodrugs with maximized therapeutic efficacy and negligible unfavorable by‐effects. In this review, recent progress in stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs in the past 20 years has been overviewed, where endogenous and exogenous stimuli have been involved. Typical examples of smart stimuli‐activable metallo‐prodrugs are discussed regarding to their molecular structure, activation mechanism, and promising biomedical applications. In the end, challenges and future perspectives in metallo‐prodrugs have been discussed.","Dichloroacetate (DCA), a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, is often used to treat lactic acidosis and malignant tumors. Increasing studies have shown that DCA has neuroprotective effects. Here, we explored the role and mechanism of DCA in Sepsis associated encephalopathy (SAE). Single-cell analysis was used to determine the important role of PDK4 in SAE and identify the cell type. GO and GSEA analysis were used to determine the correlation between DCA and pyroptosis. Through LPS + ATP stimulation, a microglia pyroptosis model was established to observe the expression level of intracellular pyroptosis-related proteins under DCA intervention, and further detect the changes in intracellular ROS and JC-1. Additionally, a co-culture environment of microglia and neuron was simply constructed to evaluate the effect of DCA on activated microglia-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Finally, Novel object recognition test and the Morris water maze were used to explore the effect of DCA on cognitive function in mice from different groups after intervention. Based on the above experiments, this study concludes that DCA can improve the ratio of peripheral and central M1 macrophages, inhibit NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis through ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). DCA can reduce neuron death caused by SAE and improve cognitive function in LPS mice. In SAE, DCA may be a potential candidate drug for the treatment of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10753-024-02105-3.",0
"PurposeLaryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs) are aggressive tumors with the second-highest morbidity rate in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Cuproptosis is a type of programmed cell death that impacts tumor malignancy and progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between cuproptosis-related long non-coding RNAs (crlncRNAs) and the tumor immune microenvironment and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in LSCC, and crlncRNA impact on LSCC malignancy.Materials and methodsClinical and RNA-sequencing data from patients with LSCC were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Differentially expressed prognosis-related crlncRNAs were identified based on univariate Cox regression analysis, a crlncRNA signature for LSCC was developed and validated using LASSO Cox regression. Finally, the effect of LINC02454, the core signature crlncRNA, on LSCC malignancy progression was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe identified a four-crlncRNA signature (LINC02454, AC026310.1, AC090517.2, and AC000123.1), according to which we divided the patients into high- and low-risk groups. The crlncRNA signature risk score was an independent prognostic indicator for overall and progression-free survival, and displayed high predictive accuracy. Patients with a higher abundance of infiltrating dendritic cells, M0 macrophages, and neutrophils had worse prognoses and those in the high-risk group were highly sensitive to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Knockdown of LINC02454 caused tumor suppression, via cuproptosis induction.ConclusionsA novel signature of four crlncRNAs was found to be highly accurate as a risk prediction model for patients with LSCC and to have potential for improving the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of LSCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05281-1.","BackgroundsCuproptosis is the most recently identified copper-dependent cell death form that influences tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, the relationship between cuproptosis and clinical prognosis, tumor microenvironment infiltration (TME), and response to immunotherapy remains unclear.MethodsSingle-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was employed to construct cuproptosisScore (cpS) and 1378 gastric cancer (GC) patients from five independent public datasets were classified into high- or low-cpS groups according to the median of cpS. Then the impacts of cuproptosis on tumor microenvironment infiltration (TME), biological function, response to immunotherapy, and clinical prognosis of GC were evaluated. RiskScore and nomogram were constructed using Lasso Cox regression algorithm to validate its predictive capability in GC patients.ResultsCompared to patients with high cpS, patients with low cpS exhibited poorer prognosis, higher TNM stage, and stronger stromal activation. Meanwhile, the analysis of response to immunotherapy confirmed patients with high cpS could better benefit from immunotherapy and had a better susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs. Then, 9 prognosis-related signatures were collected based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of cpS groups. Finally, a riskScore model was constructed using the multivariate Cox (multi-Cox) regression coefficients of prognosis-related signatures and had an excellent capability of predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival in GC patients.ConclusionsThis study revealed the role of curproptosis in TME, response to immunotherapy, and clinical prognosis in GC, which highlighted the significant clinical implications of curproptosis and provided novel ideas for the therapeutic application of cuproptosis in GC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04474-4.",1
"Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen‐presenting cells involved in promoting and controlling immune responses. Different subsets of DC, named tolerogenic (tol)DC, play a critical role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and in fostering tolerance. These unique skills make tolDC especially attractive for strategies aimed at re‐establishing/inducing tolerance in immune‐mediated conditions. The generation of potent tolDC in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes has seen remarkable advancements. TolDC modulate T cell dynamics by favoring regulatory T cells (Tregs) and curbing effector/pathogenic T cells. Among the several methods developed for in vitro tolDC generation, IL‐10 conditioning has been proven to be the most efficient, as IL‐10‐modulated tolDC were demonstrated to promote Tregs with the strongest suppressive activities. Investigating the molecular, metabolic, and functional profiles of tolDC uncovers essential pathways that facilitate their immunoregulatory functions. This Review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of tolDC in health and disease, focusing on IL‐10 production, functional characterization of in vitro generated tolDC, molecular and metabolic changes occurring in tolDC induced by tolerogenic agents, clinical applications of tolDC‐based therapy, and finally new perspectives in the generation of effective tolDC.","Adipocytes are crucial components of breast cancer and are involved in regulating the progression, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Characterized by storing energy and producing a variety of secretory factors, adipocytes are responsible for inducing obesity and regulating the tumor immune activity. Adipocytes communicate with tumor infiltrating immune cells through the secreted adipokines, cytokines, and exosomes in the breast cancer TIME, which shapes the tumor supporting environment to facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. In-depth studies of the crosstalk between adipocytes and TIME can not only provide a more comprehensive regulatory landscape of TIME, but also be conducive to screening novel targets for future precision targeted therapy. The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies for understanding the role of crosstalk between adipocytes and immune cells in shaping the breast cancer immune microenvironment.",0
"BackgroundMetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a heterogeneous disease in which molecular stratification is needed to improve clinical outcomes. The identification of predictive biomarkers can have a major impact on the care of these patients, but the availability of metastatic tissue samples for research in this setting is limited.ObjectiveTo study the prevalence of immune biomarkers of potential clinical utility to immunotherapy in mCRPC and to determine their association with overall survival (OS).Design, setting, and participantsFrom 100 patients, mCRPC biopsies were assayed by whole exome sequencing, targeted next-generation sequencing, RNA sequencing, tumor mutational burden, T-cell–inflamed gene expression profile (TcellinfGEP) score (Nanostring), and immunohistochemistry for programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), SRY homology box 2 (SOX2), and the presence of neuroendocrine features.Outcome measurements and statistical analysisThe phi coefficient determined correlations between biomarkers of interest. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) from Cox regression.Results and limitationsPD-L1 and SOX2 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (combined positive score ≥1 and >5% cells, respectively) in 24 (33%) and 27 (27%) mCRPC biopsies, respectively; 23 (26%) mCRPC biopsies had high TcellinfGEP scores (>–0.318). PD-L1 protein expression and TcellinfGEP scores were positively correlated (phi 0.63 [0.45; 0.76]). PD-L1 protein expression (aHR: 1.90 [1.05; 3.45]), high TcellinfGEP score (aHR: 1.86 [1.04; 3.31]), and SOX2 expression (aHR: 2.09 [1.20; 3.64]) were associated with worse OS.ConclusionsPD-L1, TcellinfGEP score, and SOX2 are prognostic of outcome from the mCRPC setting. If validated, predictive biomarker studies incorporating survival endpoints need to take these findings into consideration.","PurposeBaseline tumor size (BTS) and the presence of massive lesions are important for predicting the clinical course of cancer. However, their impact on survival and clinical response in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment has been scarcely investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 294 patients who underwent ICI therapy for advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between January 2016 and July 2019.ResultsOf these 294 patients, 284 (96.6%) had at least one measurable lesion. Of these, 263 patients treated with ICI monotherapy were included in the analysis. The median total and maximum target lesion diameters were 96.5 mm and 49.1 mm, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) with massive lesions (max BTS > 50 mm, group A) and without massive lesions (max BTS ≤ 50 mm, group B) was 2.5 months (95% CI 1.8–3.7) and 6.7 months (95% CI 5.1–9.7), respectively. Median overall survival (OS) for groups A and B was 9.5 months (95% CI 5.5–12.3) and 20.0 months (95% CI 13.3–32.0), respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed marked associations between the presence of massive lesions and both PFS and OS.ConclusionThe presence of massive lesions (max diameters > 50 mm) is an independent prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC treated with ICI monotherapy. Although overall response rates were similar between groups A and B, the disease control rate was significantly poorer for group A. Max BTS might be useful for predicting clinical outcomes for patients undergoing immunotherapy as a parameter reflecting their tumor burden.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03271-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"ABSTRACTGraves disease (GD) is the primary cause of hyperthyroidism in children. The standard management options—namely, antithyroid drugs (ATD), radioactive iodine, and surgery—have not changed for many years. Although ATD therapy is often the first-line treatment for pediatric patients, the low likelihood of spontaneous remission means that most children will require a more permanent solution. Recent clinical trials and systematic reviews have shed light on the long-term outcomes of ATD therapy, radioactive iodine, and surgical interventions in managing pediatric GD. Additionally, novel therapies aimed at B-cells or the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, both implicated in the pathogenesis of GD, are under investigation. However, their definitive role in treating childhood GD has yet to be established. This review will cover the latest developments in the treatment of childhood GD, including information on emerging targeted therapies.","Natural killer cells are critical players in the antitumor immune response due to their ability to destroy target cells through cytotoxic activity and other means. However, this response is inhibited in the tumor microenvironment, where a crippling hypoxic environment and several inhibitory molecules bind to NK cells to trigger an anergic state. Inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, NK2GA, KIR, TIGIT, and LAG-3 have been associated with inhibition of NK cells in multiple cancer types. Binding to these receptors leads to loss of cytotoxicity, lower proliferation and metabolic rates, and even apoptosis. While these receptors are important for avoiding auto-immunity, in a pathological setting like malignant neoplasms they are disadvantageous for the individual’s immune system to combat cancer cells. The use of monoclonal antibodies to block these receptors contributes to cancer therapy by preventing the inhibition of NK cells. In this review, the impact of NK cell inhibition and activation on cancer therapy was summarized and an overview of the blockade of inhibitory pathways by monoclonal antibodies was provided.",1
"Although memory functions of immune cells characterized by increased resistance to subsequent infections after initial pathogen exposure are well-established, it remains unclear whether non-immune cells, especially tissue-resident stem cells, exhibit similar memory mechanisms. The present study revealed that detrimental effects of initial viral antigen exposure (human papillomavirus [HPV]) on diverse stem cell functions were significantly exacerbated upon subsequent secondary exposure both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, endometrial stem cells exhibited robust memory functions following consecutive HPV antigen exposures, whereas fully differentiated cells such as fibroblasts and vesicular cells did not show corresponding changes in response to the same antigen exposures. Deficiency of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) achieved through small hairpin RNA knockdown in vitro and knockout (KO) mice in vivo highlighted the critical role of ANGPTL4 in governing memory functions associated with various stem cell processes. This regulation occurred through histone H3 methylation alterations and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in response to successive HPV antigen exposures. Furthermore, memory functions associated with various stem cell functions that were evident in wild-type mice following consecutive exposures to HPV antigen were not observed in ANGPTL4 KO mice. In summary, our findings strongly support the presence of memory mechanism in non-immune cells, particularly tissue-resident stem cells.","PurposeCD226 (DNAM-1) is an activating receptor mainly expressed in CD8 + and NK cells. CD226 deficiency and blockade have been shown to impair tumor suppression, while enhanced CD226 expression positively correlated with the increased efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the detailed function and role of CD226 in pan-cancer are largely unknown and require further in-depth investigation. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the biological functions of CD226, its role in tumor immunity, and its potential to predict prognosis and immunotherapy response in pan-cancer.MethodsBy taking advantage of single-cell and bulk sequencing analyses, we analyzed the expression profile of CD226, its correlation with patient prognosis, immune infiltration level, immune-related genes, tumor heterogeneity, and stemness in pan-cancer. We also investigated the biological functions of CD226 using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and evaluated its predictive value in response to immunotherapy and small-molecule targeted drugs. In addition, we validated the expression of CD226 in tumor-infiltrating CD8 + and NK cells and studied its association with their functions using a murine B16F10 melanoma model.ResultsCD226 exhibited differential expression across most tumor types, and its elevated expression was associated with improved clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types. CD226 is closely correlated with numerous tumor-infiltrating immune cells, tumor stemness, and heterogeneity in most cancers. Furthermore, based on single-cell sequencing analysis, CD226 expression was found to be higher on effector CD4 + T cells than naïve CD4 + T cells, and its expression level was decreased in exhausted CD8 + T cells relative to effector CD8 + T cells in multiple cancer types. Additionally, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that CD226 was highly correlated with the function of tumor-infiltrating NK and CD8 + T cells in murine B16F10 melanoma. Moreover, GSEA analysis revealed that CD226 was closely associated with T cell activation, natural killer cell mediated immunity, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and T cell receptor signaling pathway. Finally, CD226 showed promising predictive potential for responsiveness to both ICB therapies and various small-molecule targeted drugs.ConclusionCD226 has shown great potential as an innovative biomarker for predicting patient prognosis, immune infiltration levels, and the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells, as well as immunotherapy response. Additionally, our findings suggest that the optimal modification of CD226 expression and function, combined with current ICBs, could be a promising strategy for tumor immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05268-y.",0
"ABSTRACTAimsStudy on the prognostic characteristics and biomarkers of lung cancer in Xuanwei Patients.Materials and MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on the genetic data of 261 NSCLC patients, as well as the prognostic data of 133 patients. The relationship between prognosis and EGFR mutations in the Xuanwei and non Xuanwei cohorts was compared and analyzed.ResultsThe superior progression-free survival (PFS) in Xuanwei patients was primarily observed in those with EGFR-mutated tumors (p < 0.05). Further analysis of accompanying mutations and TMB levels revealed an association between high TMB and a favorable prognosis in EGFR-mutated Xuanwei NSCLC.ConclusionXuanwei lung cancer differs from non Xuanwei patients in terms of prognosis and tumor mutation burden, and further research should be conducted.","AbstractAbnormal activation of EGFR is often associated with various malignant tumors, making it an important target for antitumor therapy. However, traditional targeted inhibitors have several limitations, such as drug resistance and side effects. Many studies have focused on the development of EGFR degraders to overcome this resistance and enhance the therapeutic effect on tumors. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTAC) and Lysosome-based degradation techniques have made significant progress in degrading EGFR. This review provides a summary of the structural and function of EGFR, the resistance, particularly the research progress and activity of EGFR degraders via the proteasome and lysosome.

"Aim: This study aimed to determine the expression pattern of autoantibody proteins from the serum of grade IV glioblastoma patients.Materials & methods: We performed high throughput antibody profiling via the Sengenics i-Ome® Protein Array to determine the differentially expressed autoantibodies.Results: The results portrayed that anti-COL4A3BP and anti-HSP90AA1 were among the upregulated autoantibodies in glioblastoma sera.Conclusion: The selected autoantibodies offer promising targets for future glioblastoma pathogenesis. However, further validation is required to elucidate the autoantibody signature in glioblastoma patients.","BackgroundChemokines play a vital role in tumor progression, metastasis and prognosis; however, the profile and clinical significance of gamma interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and its receptor (CXCR3) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well evaluated.MethodsLiquid-phase chip technology was used to detect the serum IP-10 in 85 patients with HBV-related HCC, 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 50 liver cirrhosis subjects (CS); simultaneously, the CXCR3 and Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) were determined. Additionally, their mRNA or protein expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), liver tumor and paracancerous tissues were quantified using qRT-PCR or ELISA. Moreover, the IP-10 and CXCR3 expression was verified by the online data from Gene Expression Omnibus. Furthermore, the relationships of serum IP-10, CXCR3 and AFP levels with their overall survival rate were also analyzed.ResultsThe levels of IP-10 and CXCR3 in HCC group were significantly higher than those in CHB and CS groups, and their mRNA of PBMC is significantly positive correlation with those in their liver tissues or HBV DNA load (P < 0.0001), respectively. The serum IP-10 and CXCR3 in HCC were significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, metastases staging and distant metastasis (P < 0.05), but not related to gender, age and tumor size (P > 0.05, except IP-10 based on age).ConclusionsThe serum IP-10 (142.6 pg/mL) and CXCR3 (241.2 pg/mL) could be differential diagnostic surrogates that distinguish HCC from CS, and the lower IP-10 level may be conducive to the postoperative survival of HCC patients. Moreover, the IP-10 and CXCR3 would be related to anti-tumor immunity in HCC patients and be a potential target for treatment of HCC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05265-1.",0
"AbstractMitotic arrest-deficient 2 like 1 (MAD2L1) is a component of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint implicated in cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The functional role of MAD2L1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been adequately investigated, especially in vivo. In the current manuscript, we sought to address the function of MAD2L1 in hepatocarcinogenesis. We found that MAD2L1 expression is upregulated in human HCCs, where its expression is associated with higher aggressive tumor grade, elevated proliferative activity, and poor prognosis. In human HCC cell lines, MAD2L1 knockdown led to decreased cell growth. Moreover, RNA-seq results demonstrated that MAD2L1 silencing induces the expression of genes associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, and various cancer-related pathways, supporting the critical role of MAD2L1 during HCC growth and differentiation. In a c-MYC-induced mouse HCC model, we revealed an increased expression of Mad2l1. Furthermore, Mad2l1 CRIPSR-mediated silencing prevented c-MYC-driven mouse liver development. Altogether, our study suggests that MAD2L1 plays a crucial role in hepatocarcinogenesis, and that its suppression could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating human HCC.MAD2L1 plays a critical role in liver cancer development, silencing MAD2L1 reduced cell growth in vitro and inhibited c-MYC-driven liver cancer development in vivo. MAD2L1 suppression might be a promising therapeutic approach for treating human liver cancer.","In response to prolonged stimulation by tumour antigens, T cells gradually become exhausted. There is growing evidence that exhausted T cells not only lose their potent effector functions but also express multiple inhibitory receptors. Checkpoint blockade (CPB) therapy can improve cancer by reactivating exhausted effector cell function, leading to durable clinical responses, but further improvements are needed given the limited number of patients who benefit from treatment, even with autoimmune complications. Here, we suggest, based on recent advances that tumour antigens are the primary culprits of exhaustion, followed by some immune cells and cytokines that also play an accomplice role in the exhaustion process, and we also propose that chronic stress-induced hypoxia and hormones also play an important role in promoting T-cell exhaustion. Understanding the classification of exhausted CD8+ T-cell subpopulations and their functions is important for the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapies. We mapped the differentiation of T-cell exhausted subpopulations by changes in transcription factors, indicating that T-cell exhaustion is a dynamic developmental process. Finally, we summarized the novel immune checkpoints associated with depletion in recent years and combined them with bioinformatics to construct a web of exhaustion-related immune checkpoints with the aim of finding novel therapeutic targets associated with T-cell exhaustion in malignant tumours, aiming to revive the killing ability of exhausted T cells and restore anti-tumour immunity through combined targeted immunotherapy.",0
"AbstractObjectiveTo uncover the role of nuclear receptor-binding protein 2 (NRBP2) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and CAFmediated TAM sensitivity in breast cancer (BC).Methods10 pairs of matched tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected and CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated. CCK-8 as well as colony formation assays showed the effects on cell growth. qPCR and Immunoblot showed the expression of NRBP2 in CAFs. FCM as well as Immunoblot assays exhibited the effects on cell apoptosis. Immunoblot further confirmed the mechanism.ResultsCAFs contributed to BC cell growth. In addition, the expression of NRBP2 is downregulated in CAFs. NRBP2 suppressed CAF-induced resistance in BC cells. Further, NRBP2 expression in CAF group increased TAM induced apoptosis. Mechanically, NRBP2 in CAFs inhibited Akt pathway, therefore suppressed resistance in BC cells.ConclusionCAFs affected BC cell sensitivity to TAM by regulating NRBP2.","KRAS mutations play a critical role in the development and progression of several cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Despite advancements in targeted therapies, the management of KRAS-mutant tumors remains challenging. This study leverages bibliometric analysis and a comprehensive review of clinical trials to identify emerging immunotherapies and potential treatments for KRAS-related cancers. Using the Web of Science Core Collection and Citespace, we analyzed publications from January 2008 to March 2023 alongside 52 clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO’s registry, concentrating on immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) and novel therapies. Our study highlights an increased focus on the tumor immune microenvironment and precision therapy. Clinical trials reveal the effectiveness of ICBs and the promising potential of T-cell receptor T-cell therapy and vaccines in treating KRAS-mutant cancers. ICBs, particularly in combination therapies, stand out in managing KRAS-mutant tumors. Identifying the tumor microenvironment and gene co-mutation profiles as key research areas, our findings advocate for multidisciplinary approaches to advance personalized cancer treatment. Future research should integrate genetic, immunological, and computational studies to unveil new therapeutic targets and refine treatment strategies for KRAS-mutant cancers.",0
"Local and systemic immunosuppression are prominent features of pancreatic cancer, rendering anti-tumor effector cells inactive and immunotherapeutic approaches ineffective. The spleen, an understudied point of antigen-presentation and T cell priming in humans, holds particular importance in pancreatic cancer due to its proximity to the developing tumor. As main effectors of antigen presentation, dendritic cells display antigens to lymphocytes, thereby bridging the innate and adaptive immune response. While tumor-infiltrating anti-inflammatory dendritic cells have been described, splenic dendritic cells have historically just been considered to stimulate the anti-tumor immune response. Here, we describe, for the first time, the presence of an immunosuppressive, tolerogenic IDO1+ dendritic cell subset in the spleens of pancreatic cancer patients that likely contributes to systemic immunosuppression that is associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Network analysis of scRNA seq data reveals extensive communication networks between the identified tolerogenic DC cluster and numerous immune cell populations in the spleen. Interactions with innate and adaptive immune cells suggest a broad influence on leukocyte trafficking and immune regulation within the spleen microenvironment. The identification of signaling pathways involving AHR and IDO-1, CCL19, NECTIN2, CLEC2D, and others elucidates potential mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive functions of this cell type.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",1
"The number of therapies for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction has nearly doubled in the past decade. In addition, new therapies for HF caused by hypertrophic and infiltrative disease are emerging rapidly. Indeed, we are on the verge of a new era in HF in which insights into the biology of myocardial disease can be matched to an understanding of the genetic predisposition in an individual patient to inform precision approaches to therapy. In this Review, we summarize the biology of HF, emphasizing the causal relationships between genetic contributors and traditional structure-based remodelling outcomes, and highlight the mechanisms of action of traditional and novel therapeutics. We discuss the latest advances in our understanding of both the Mendelian genetics of cardiomyopathy and the complex genetics of the clinical syndrome presenting as HF. In the phenotypic domain, we discuss applications of machine learning for the subcategorization of HF in ways that might inform rational prescribing of medications. We aim to bridge the gap between the biology of the failing heart, its diverse clinical presentations and the range of medications that we can now use to treat it. We present a roadmap for the future of precision medicine in HF.","Cell processing laboratories are an important part of cancer treatment centers. Cell processing laboratories began by supporting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation programs. These laboratories adapted closed bag systems, centrifuges, sterile connecting devices and other equipment used in transfusion services/blood banks to remove red blood cells and plasma from marrow and peripheral blood stem cells products. The success of cellular cancer immunotherapies such as Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells has increased the importance of cell processing laboratories. Since many of the diseases successfully treated by CAR T-cell therapy are also treated by HSC transplantation and since HSC transplantation teams are well suited to manage patients treated with CAR T-cells, many cell processing laboratories have begun to produce CAR T-cells. The methods that have been used to process HSCs have been modified for T-cell enrichment, culture, stimulation, transduction and expansion for CAR T-cell production. While processing laboratories are well suited to manufacture CAR T-cells and other cellular therapies, producing these therapies is challenging. The manufacture of cellular therapies requires specialized facilities which are costly to build and maintain. The supplies and reagents, especially vectors, can also be expensive. Finally, highly skilled staff are required. The use of automated equipment for cell production may reduce labor requirements and the cost of facilities. The steps used to produce CAR T-cells are reviewed, as well as various strategies for establishing a laboratory to manufacture these cells.",0
"PurposeAging is closely related to the occurrence of many diseases, including cancer, and involves changes in the immune microenvironment. γδT cells are important components of resident lymphocytes in mucosal tissues. However, little is known about the effects that the aged lung has on γδT cells and their prognostic significance in non-small cell lung cancer.MethodsIn the current study, the expression of γδTCR and IL-17A was measured by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 168 patients with adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 144 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Furthermore, gene transcription patterns in LUAD and LUSC tumors and normal controls were extracted from TCGA and GTEx databases and were analyzed.ResultsHigh frequency of γδT cells was observed in patients with LUAD and LUSC, whereas the levels of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD56 + cells were decreased. Elevated γδT cells in tumors were mainly IL-17A-releasing γδT17 cells, which were found to be enriched in aged patients. High γδT cell levels positively corelated with the overall survival (OS) of patients, especially the 5-year OS in the elderly. Further analysis of gene transcription patterns indicated that increased expression of LTBR, HES1, RORC, CCR6, IL1, and IL23A may contribute to the transformation of the tumor microenvironment in a manner conducive to γδT17 cell development and differentiation. Finally, gene analysis between different age groups revealed that the expression of CCR6 and IL7 in LUAD, as well as Hes1, IL7, and IL23A in LUSC, were remarkably higher in elderly (age ≥ 60 years) than in younger individuals (age < 60 years).ConclusionOur findings suggest that intrinsic alterations in the aging lung lead to γδT17 cell enrichment, which subsequently may exert anti-tumor effects in the elderly.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03742-z.","AimThe aim of this study was to construct and validate a nomogram to predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) in external ear melanoma (EEM) patients in the elderly based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.MethodsThe information of patients diagnosed with EEM in the elderly between 2010 and 2014 was downloaded from the SEER database. Univariable and multivariable Cox analyses were carried out to identify the independent characteristics, and the independent factors were further included to construct a nomogram. The discriminative ability and calibration of the nomogram to predict OS were tested using C-index value, and calibration plots. Based on the risk score of the nomogram, the patients were divided into high- and low-risk subgroup. Finally, the survival differences of different subgroups were explored by Kaplan–Meier curves. All statistical analyses were performed by R 4.2.0.ResultsA total of 710 elderly EMM patients were included and randomly divided into training cohort and validation cohort. Univariable Cox regression were used to identify age, race, sex, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), T, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tumor size as independent risk factors. Then, multivariable Cox model to determine significant risk factors was used to establish the selected factors. A nomogram for predicting the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was constructed using the independent variables including age, AJCC, T, surgery and chemotherapy. The C-index values were 0.78 (95% CI 0.75–0.81) in training set and 0.72 (95% CI 0.66–0.78) in validation set. The calibration curves were closer to ideal curves indicated the accurate predictive ability of this nomogram. The elderly patients with EEM in the low-risk group showed a longer OS than patients in the high-risk group in both training and validation cohorts.ConclusionsOur study established and validated a novel model to predict 1-, 3- and 5-year OS for EEM. The individualized nomogram has a good prognostic ability and can be used as a new survival prediction tool for the elderly patients with EMM.",1
"AbstractMitotic arrest-deficient 2 like 1 (MAD2L1) is a component of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint implicated in cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The functional role of MAD2L1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been adequately investigated, especially in vivo. In the current manuscript, we sought to address the function of MAD2L1 in hepatocarcinogenesis. We found that MAD2L1 expression is upregulated in human HCCs, where its expression is associated with higher aggressive tumor grade, elevated proliferative activity, and poor prognosis. In human HCC cell lines, MAD2L1 knockdown led to decreased cell growth. Moreover, RNA-seq results demonstrated that MAD2L1 silencing induces the expression of genes associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, and various cancer-related pathways, supporting the critical role of MAD2L1 during HCC growth and differentiation. In a c-MYC-induced mouse HCC model, we revealed an increased expression of Mad2l1. Furthermore, Mad2l1 CRIPSR-mediated silencing prevented c-MYC-driven mouse liver development. Altogether, our study suggests that MAD2L1 plays a crucial role in hepatocarcinogenesis, and that its suppression could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating human HCC.MAD2L1 plays a critical role in liver cancer development, silencing MAD2L1 reduced cell growth in vitro and inhibited c-MYC-driven liver cancer development in vivo. MAD2L1 suppression might be a promising therapeutic approach for treating human liver cancer.","BackgroundGliomas are the most common highly aggressive primary malignant brain tumors in adults with different biological behaviors and clinically heterogeneous features. About the extremely poor prognosis of gliomas, the search for potential therapeutic modalities and targets is crucial.MethodWe extracted the anoikis-related genes (ARG) from GeneCards and obtained differentially expressed genes in normal and glioma tissues from the GSE4290 dataset to obtain intersect differentially expressed ARG in gliomas by differential analysis. KEGG and GO analyses were used to evaluate the potential pathways and molecular processes of these genes. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training cohort, we performed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and Cox regression to construct an ARG prognostic model and validated them in the TCGA testing cohort and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) validation cohort. Subsequently, we further explored the differences in clinical characteristics, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and the immune microenvironment in the high- and low-risk groups. Univariate and multifactorial regression analyses and nomogram construction were also performed. Moreover, we evaluated the expression levels of key genes via public databases, qPCR analysis and IHC staining, and further assessed the clinical prognostic value.ResultsThe regulatory model based on quantitative ARG prognostic models showed that patients in the high-risk group were associated with poorer survival prognosis, poorer clinical characteristics, and higher TMB levels. Moreover, the high-risk group had high levels of immune infiltration and upregulated immune checkpoint gene expression. The ARG prognostic model and the Nomogram showed good predictive performance. Expression and survival analysis of five prognostic ARG signatures (ETV4, HMOX1, MYC, NFE2L2, and UBE2C) showed that these genes have potential prognostic value.ConclusionOur constructed ARG prognostic risk model provides a potential therapeutic target and theoretical basis for predicting the prognosis of glioma patients and guiding individualized immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05138-7.",0
"In gynecological oncology, ovarian cancer (OC) remains the most lethal, highlighting its significance in public health. Our research focused on the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in OC, particularly senescence-related lncRNAs (SnRlncRNAs), crucial for OC prognosis. Utilizing data from the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) and cancer genome Atlas (TCGA), SnRlncRNAs were discerned and subsequently, a risk signature was sculpted using co-expression and differential expression analyses, Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). This signature's robustness was validated through time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and multivariate Cox regression, with further validation in the international cancer genome consortium (ICGC). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) unveiled pathways intertwined with risk groups. The ROC, alongside the nomogram and calibration outcomes, attested to the model's robust predictive accuracy. Of particular significance, our model has demonstrated superiority over several commonly utilized clinical indicators, such as stage and grade. Patients in the low-risk group demonstrated greater immune infiltration and varied drug sensitivities compared to other groups. Moreover, consensus clustering classified OC patients into four distinct groups based on the expression of 17 SnRlncRNAs, showing diverse survival rates. In conclusion, these findings underscored the robustness and reliability of our model and highlighted its potential for facilitating improved decision-making in the context of risk assessment, and demonstrated that these markers potentially served as robust, efficacious biomarkers and prognostic tools, offering insights into predicting OC response to anticancer therapeutics.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00163-z.","BackgroundColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, which imposes a significant societal burden. Regular screening and emerging molecular tumor markers have important implications for detecting the progression and development of colorectal cancer. Disulfidptosis is a newly defined type of programmed cell death triggered by abnormal accumulation of disulfide compounds in cells that stimulate disulfide stress. Currently, there is no relevant discussion on this mechanism and colorectal cancer.MethodsWe classified the disulfidptosis-related subtypes of colorectal cancer using bioinformatics methods. Through secondary clustering of differentially expressed genes between subtypes, we identified characteristic genes of the disulfidptosis subtype, constructed a prognostic model, and searched for potential biomarkers through clinical validation.ResultsUsing disulfidptosis-related genes collected from the literature, we classified colorectal cancer patients from public databases into three subtypes. The differentially expressed genes between subtypes were clustered into three gene subtypes, and eight characteristic genes were screened to construct a prognostic model.ConclusionThe disulfidptosis mechanism has important value in the classification of colorectal cancer patients, and characteristic genes selected based on this mechanism can serve as a new potential biological marker for colorectal cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05211-1.",1
"IntroductionImmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and has generated remarkable clinical results against multiple malignancies. Exploration of new technical approaches to further boost the therapeutic efficacy of ICB is of potential medical importance. In this study, we designed a novel nanotherapeutics for ICB immunotherapy.MethodsCTLA-4 aptamers were conjugated to the surface of albumin nanoparticle to construct an aptamer-modified nanostructure (Apt-NP). To improve ICB efficacy, fexofenadine (FEXO), an antihistamine, was encapsulated into Apt-NP to make a drug-loaded nanoparticle (Apt-NP-FEXO). The antitumor efficacies of Apt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.ResultsApt-NP and Apt-NP-FEXO had average diameters of 149 nm and 159 nm, respectively. Similar to free CTLA-4 aptamers, Apt-modified NPs could selectively bind with CTLA-4 positive cells and improve lymphocyte-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity in vitro. In animal studies, compared with free CTLA-4 aptamer, Apt-NP significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Moreover, Apt-NP-FEXO further improved antitumor efficacy vs. Apt-NP in vivo.ConclusionThe results suggest that Apt-NP-FEXO represents a novel strategy to improve ICB outcome and may have application potential in cancer immunotherapy.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibition therapy (ICIT) is an emerging field in oncology especially opening new horizons to chemotherapy refractory patients. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and undesired response patterns such as progression after the initial good response in a subset of patients pose a major challenge and drawback to ICIT. This paper provides deep insight into ICIT related bottlenecks and corresponding effective management and combat strategies for very complex complications.MethodsThe relevant literatures from PubMed have been reviewed. Based on obtained information, rigorous and exhaustive analyses have been made to present novel methods and strategies against ICIT drawbacks and bottlenecks.ResultsThe results show that baseline biomarker tests are very crucial to identify suitable candidates for ICIT and frequent assessments throughout ICIT help to recognize possible irAEs at early stages. Equally important are the necessity for mathematical definitions for the ICIT success rate and optimum duration, and the development of combat mechanisms against loss of sensitivity within the tumor microenvironment (TME).ConclusionRigorous management approaches are presented for mostly observed irAEs. Furthermore, for the first time in the literature, a non-linear mathematical model is invented to measure the ICIT success rate and to decide about the optimum ICIT duration. Finally, a strategy against tumor plasticity is introduced.",1
"Aim: To investigate DNA methylation levels of a panel of genes in thymic epithelial tumors (TETs).Materials & methods: We selected 15 genes among the most promising epigenetic biomarkers of TETs and evaluated their methylation levels in 71 TET samples.Results: thymic carcinomas (TCs) showed hypermethylation of GHSR and ELF3 genes and reduced IL1RN methylation levels compared with thymomas (TMs) and healthy thymic tissues. RAG1 was hypomethylated in TMs compared with healthy thymic tissues. No difference in the methylation levels of the investigated genes was seen among TM stages and subtypes. No changes in blood methylation levels of the investigated genes were seen among TET subtypes.Conclusion: The present study confirms GHSR, ELF3, IL1RN and RAG1 as TET epigenetic biomarkers.","PurposeThe current evaluation methods for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly CD8 + TILs, mainly rely on semiquantitative immunohistochemistry with high variability. We aimed to construct an individualized DNA methylation-based signature for CD8 + TILs (CD8 + MeTIL) that may characterize melanoma immune microenvironment and guide therapeutic selection.MethodsThe transcriptome profiles and DNA methylation data of 457 melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed. Differential methylation analysis between groups with high and low CD8 + TILs was performed to select differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and define CD8 + MeTIL. The prognostic value of CD8 + MeTIL and its predictive value for immunotherapy response were investigated using multiple melanoma cohorts.ResultsWe successfully constructed the CD8 + MeTIL signature based on four DMPs. The survival analyses showed that higher CD8 + MeTIL score was associated with worse survival outcomes in TCGA-SKCM and GSE144487 cohorts. The ROC curve for the predictive analysis revealed that the survival prediction of CD8 + MeTIL score was superior compared with CD8 + TILs (CIBERSORT) and CD8B mRNA expression. Furthermore, we founded that tumors with higher CD8 + MeTIL score were marked with immunosuppressive characteristics, including low immune score and downregulated immune-related pathways. More importantly, the CD8 + MeTIL score showed a potential predictive value for the benefit from immunotherapy in two published cohorts. When combined CD8 + MeTIL with PD-L1 expression, the patient classification showed significantly different immunotherapy response rates and long-term survival outcomes.ConclusionsThe CD8 + MeTIL signature might be as a novel method to evaluate CD8 + TILs and guide immunotherapy approaches.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04566-1.",1
"ABSTRACTBreast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms affecting women worldwide, and it remains a leading cause of both mortality and morbidity. While genetic predisposition plays a critical role in the development of this neoplasm, significant epigenetic dysregulations accompany existing variants. The emergence of acquired drug resistance to current chemotherapeutics poses a significant challenge in managing therapy. However, progress has been made in developing novel agents that directly target epigenetic modifications. These agents, called “epi-drugs,” can be used alone in the clinic or in combination with current treatment regimens, offering the potential to create diversified effects on the disease’s predictive process. Within the scope of this review, general information about the major epigenetic dysregulations in breast cancer will be provided, and their effects on the molecular mechanisms in the carcinogenesis process will be discussed. Furthermore, current treatment approaches for breast cancer will be explored, classifying these epi-drugs, such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs), histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), histone acetyltransferases (HATIs), and others that have been developed to target these mechanisms. Predictions regarding the future prospects of these epi-drugs are highlighted, and their contributions to the field of personalized medicine are emphasized based on the results obtained from clinical studies.","Background:Few studies have examined depression after a cancer diagnosis and before initiating adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic treatments. In this study, we present baseline data on device-measured physical activity, sedentary behaviour, depression, happiness, and satisfaction with life in newly diagnosed breast cancer survivors.Purpose:To examine associations of accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary time with depression symptoms and prevalence, happiness, and satisfaction with life.Methods:Shortly after diagnosis, 1,425 participants completed depression, happiness, and satisfaction with life measures and wore an ActiGraph® device on their hip to measure physical activity and the activPAL™ inclinometer on their thigh for seven days to measure sedentary time (sitting/lying) and steps (1,384 completed both device measures). ActiGraph® data were analyzed using a hybrid machine learning method (R Sojourn package, Soj3x), and activPAL™ data using activPAL™ algorithms (PAL Software version 8). We used linear and logistic regression to examine associations of physical activity and sedentary time with depression symptom severity (0–27) and depression prevalence, happiness (0–100), and satisfaction with life (0–35). For the logistic regression analysis, we compared participants with none-minimal depression (n=895) to participants with some depression [that is, mild, moderate, moderately-severe, or severe depression (n=530)].Results:Participants reported a mean depression symptom severity score of 4.3 (SD=4.1), a satisfaction with life score of 25.7 (SD=7.2), and a happiness score of 70 (SD=21.8). Higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was associated with reduced depression symptom severity scores (β=−0.51, 95% CI: −0.87 to −0.14, p=0.007). A one hour increase in MVPA was associated with a reduced odds of at least mild or worse depression by 24% [Odds Ratio (OR) =0.76, 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.94, p=0.012). Higher daily step counts were associated with lower depression symptom severity scores (β=−0.16, 95% CI: −0.24 to −0.10, p<0.001). Perceptions of happiness was associated with higher MVPA (β=2.17, 95% CI: 0.17 to 4.17, p=0.033). Sedentary time was not associated with depression severity, but higher sedentary time was associated with lower perceptions of happiness (β=−0.80, 95% CI: −1.48 to −0.11, p=0.023).Conclusions:Higher physical activity was associated with fewer depression symptom severity scores and reduced odds of mild or worse depression in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Higher physical activity and daily step counts were also associated with stronger perceptions of happiness and satisfaction with life, respectively. Sedentary time was not associated with depression symptom severity or odds of having depression, but was associated with stronger perceptions of happiness.",1
"AbstractImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are used for treating many types of cancers. Neurological adverse effects are uncommon (incidence of 7.2%), however these effects can have life-threatening outcomes when they occur. We present a case of a 78-year-old male with an existing diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) with metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). He was diagnosed in 2015 with ocular myasthenia gravis that was acetylcholine receptor antibody positive. He developed an exacerbation with double vision, fatigue, and upper extremity weakness that resolved with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). During this year, he also had a thymectomy and he was controlled on Mestinon. Five months after his MG diagnosis, he was diagnosed with BCC and was given Vismodegib, however he had metastasis to the spine and lymph nodes. Unfortunately, he had no other treatment options besides immunotherapy, thus Cemiplimab was given in 2023. Ten days after receiving his 2nd dose, he developed left eye ptosis, neck weakness, shortness of breath, dysphagia, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and urinary retention. Workup additionally revealed concern for myocarditis and myositis. He received IVIG and intravenous methylprednisolone initially, and then had maintenance IVIG 1g/kg every 2 weeks with a prednisone taper. Due to ongoing symptoms, he got Rituximab which improved most of the symptoms except for dysphagia. He then received Efgartigimod alfa-fcab (Vyvgart) but had no improvement in dysphagia. Later, plasmapheresis (PLEX) was trialed but there was a partial response. Unfortunately, he obtained a PEG tube for dysphagia and declined significantly due to disease progression and multiple medical comorbidities. Myasthenia Gravis crisis from ICI therapy is a rare but serious treatment complication. In addition to the challenging nature of treating this condition, our case highlights the importance of a comprehensive work up to include consideration of overlap syndromes, such as myocarditis and myositis as identified in this case.","ObjectiveGanoderic acid A can inhibit the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells. Surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of ganoderic acid A still remain poorly defined. Ganoderic acid A derivative (GaAD19) is an effective ingredient obtained by structural modification of ganoderic acid A. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-proliferation effect of GaAD19 on cervical cancer cells.MethodsThrough the HeLa cervical cancer cell model, the drug target of GaAD19 was predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database and molecular docking. Subsequently, computer analysis results were verified by a series of molecular biology experiments, such as flow cytometry, Western blot, immunocytochemical staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and so on. Then, pathway agonists and inhibitors were used to investigate the mechanism of GaAD19. Finally, the mouse model of cervical cancer was established to evaluate the inhibitory effect of GaAD19 on tumor growth in U14 cervical cancer mice.ResultsGaAD19 induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of tumors. It also blocked the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. However, in the presence of a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)agonist, the effects of GaAD19 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle transition of cancer cells were suppressed.ConclusionThis study showed that GaAD19 can play an anti-cervical cancer role by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway. These results will be helpful in further exploring the mechanism of GaAD19 in the treatment of cervical cancer.",0
"Objectives.To comprehensively investigate nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment, overall survival (OS), and the influence of clinical/sociodemographic factors on outcome.Study Design.Retrospective database study.Setting.National Cancer Database.Methods.The 2004–2015 National Cancer Database was queried for all patients with NPC receiving definitive treatment. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were used for statistical analyses.Results.A total of 8260 patients with NPC were included (71.4% male; 42.5% with keratinizing histology; mean ± SD age, 52.1 ± 15.1 years), with a 5-year OS of 63.4%. Multivariate predictors of mortality included age ≥65 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81; P < .001), Charlson/Deyo score ≥1 (HR, 1.27; P = .001), American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical stage III to IV (HR, 1.85; P < .001), and government insurance or no insurance (HR, 1.53; P < .001). Predictors of survival included female sex (HR, 0.82; P = .002), Asian/Pacific Islander race (HR, 0.74; P <.001), nonkeratinizing/undifferentiated histology (HR, 0.79; P = .004), and receiving treatment at academic centers (HR, 0.87; P = .02). Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) demonstrated improved OS as compared with radiotherapy (RT) only for stage II (P = .006) and stage III (P = .005) and with RT or chemotherapy only in stage IVA NPC (P < .001). When compared with CRT alone, surgery plus CRT provided OS benefits in keratinizing (P = .013) or stage IVA (P = .030) NPC. When compared with RT, CRT provided OS benefits in keratinizing (P = .005) but not nonkeratinizing (P = .240) or undifferentiated (P = .390) NPC. Substandard radiation dosing of <60 Gy and <30 fractions were associated with inferior OS (both P <.001).Conclusions.NPC survival is dependent on a variety of clinical/sociodemographic factors. Stage-specific treatments with optimal OS include CRT or RT for stages I to II and CRT for stage III to IV. The large representation of nonendemic histology is valuable, as these cases are not well characterized.","PurposeDistant metastasis is the main obstacle to treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tumor distance metastasis is a complex process involving the jointly participation of multiple oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and metastasis-associated genes. Enough accurate prognostic genes for evaluating metastasis risk are lacking. We aimed to identify more precise biomarkers for NPC metastasis.MethodsWe performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed gene analysis, univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression, and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analyses, on data obtained from RNA sequencing of 10 NPC samples and the public database, to identify key genes correlated with NPC metastasis. Wound healing assays, transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate our bioinformatic conclusions. Western blotting was performed to evaluate and quantify the effect of identified EMT genes on epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NPC.ResultsCombined our own RNA sequencing data and public data, we determined carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein (CPVL) as a tumor suppressor for NPC. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that genes associated with CPVL are involved in EMT. NPC with low CPVL expression had high tumor purity and low levels of immune cells. Experimental results showed that CPVL protein predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic and membranous and it exhibited higher expression levels in NPC tissues without distant metastasis than those with distant metastasis. CPVL inhibits the migration and invasive capability of NPC cells. Overexpression of CPVL upregulates E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas it downregulates vimentin, suggesting that CPVL suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT.ConclusionCPVL inhibits migration and invasion of NPC cells and is associated with tumor metastasis suppression through upregulating epithelial marker and inhibiting mesenchymal marker expression and could be a prognostic biomarker for metastasis risk evaluation in NPC.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05340-7.",1
"BackgroundGrowing evidence supports changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome over the course of pregnancy may have an impact on the short- and long-term health of both the mother and the child.ObjectiveOur objective was to explore the association of diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), with the composition and gene ontology (GO) representation of microbial function in the maternal gastrointestinal microbiome during pregnancy.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, observational analysis of n = 185 pregnant participants in the Pregnancy Eating Attributes Study. Maternal dietary intake was assessed in the first trimester using the automated self-administered 24-h recall method, from which the HEI 2015 was calculated. Rectal swabs were obtained in the second trimester and sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 system shotgun platform. We used unsupervised clustering to identify microbial enterotypes representative of maternal taxa and GO functional term composition. Multivariable linear models were used to identify associations between taxa, functional terms, and food components while controlling for relevant covariates. Multinomial regression was then used to predict enterotype membership based on a participant’s HEI food component score.ResultsThose in the high diet quality tertile had a lower early pregnancy BMI [mean (M) = 23.48 kg/m2, SD = 3.38] compared with the middle (M = 27.35, SD = 6.01) and low (M = 27.49, SD = 6.99) diet quality tertiles (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant associations between the HEI components or the total HEI score and the 4 alpha diversity measures. Differences in taxa and GO term enterotypes were found in participants with, but not limited to, a higher saturated fat component score (β = 1.35, P = 0.01), added sugar HEI component (β = 0.07, P < 0.001), and higher total dairy score (β = 1.58, P = 0.01).ConclusionsSpecific dietary components are associated with microbial composition and function in the second trimester of pregnancy. These findings provide a foundation for future testable hypotheses.","IntroductionIncreasing evidence indicates an important role of microbiota in cancer development and progression, while little is known about the correlation between microbiota and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Thus, we performed this study to profile the intratumoral microbiota possibly associated with RCC.Materials and methodsPaired RCC and adjacent normal tissue samples were collected from 24 patients with RCC. V3-V4 variable region of microbial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing reads were processed using QIIME. Differentially abundant bacterial taxa between groups were identified by LEfSe, and their potential functions were inferred by PICRUSt.ResultsDecreased species diversity was presented in RCC tissues (Simpson index, P = 0.0340), and the composition of the bacterial community in RCC tissues was significantly distinct from that in normal tissues (unweighted UniFrac distance, P = 0.026; weighted UniFrac distance, P = 0.017). Compared with normal tissues, 25 taxa increased and 47 reduced taxa were identified in RCC tissues. Among these taxa, the class Chloroplast (AUC = 0.91, P < 0.0001) and the order Streptophyta (AUC = 0.89, P < 0.0001) showed high indication accuracy to discriminate RCC tissues from normal tissues. Furthermore, nine altered pathways were identified in RCC tissues to reveal the potential microbial function.ConclusionsOur results have uncovered the presence of distinct microbiota in RCC and adjacent normal tissues and provided a better understanding of the possible role of the intratumoral microbiota in RCC. Further studies are required to confirm our results and determine the real correlation between microbiota and RCC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03462-w) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"Metastasis remains the primary cause of cancer-related death. The succession of events that characterize the metastatic cascade presents multiple opportunities for therapeutic intervention, and the ability to accurately model them in mice is critical to evaluate their effects. Here, a step-by-step protocol is presented for the establishment of orthotopic primary breast tumors and the subsequent monitoring of the establishment and growth of metastatic lesions in the lung using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. This methodology allows for the evaluation of treatment or its biological effects along the entire range of metastatic development, from primary tumor escape to outgrowth in the lungs. Breast orthotopic tumors are generated in mice via injection of a luciferase-labeled cell suspension in the 4th mammary gland. Tumors are allowed to grow and disseminate for a specific amount of time and are then surgically resected. Upon resection, spontaneous lung metastasis is detected, and the growth over time is monitored using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. At the desired experimental endpoint, lung tissue can be collected for downstream analysis. The treatment of established, clinically evident metastasis is critical to improve outcomes for stage IV cancer patients, and it can be evaluated through tail vein models of experimental lung metastasis. However, metastatic dissemination occurs early in breast cancer, and many patients have latent, subclinical disseminated disease after surgery. Utilization of spontaneous models such as this one provides the opportunity to study the whole spectrum of the disease, especially the systemic effects driven by treatment of the primary tumor such as pre-metastatic niche priming, and evaluate treatments on dormant and subclinical disease after surgery.","Background and Aims:Ambiguous understanding of tumors and tumor microenvironments (TMEs) hinders accurate diagnosis and available treatment for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) covering intrahepatic metastasis (IM) and multicentric occurrence (MO). Here, we characterized the diverse TMEs of IM and MO identified by whole-exome sequencing at single-cell resolution.Approach and Results:We performed parallel whole-exome sequencing and scRNA-seq on 23 samples from 7 patients to profile their TMEs when major results were validated by immunohistochemistry in the additional cohort. Integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing found that malignant cells in IM showed higher intratumor heterogeneity, stemness, and more activated metabolism than those in MO. Tumors from IM shared similar TMEs while distinct TMEs were noticed in those from MO. Furthermore, CD20+ B cells, plasma cells, and conventional type II dendritic cells (cDC2s) were decreased in IM relative to MO while T cells in IM exhibited a more terminally exhausted capacity with a higher proportion of proliferative/exhausted T cells than that in MO. Both CD20 and CD1C correlated with better prognosis in multifocal HCC. Additionally, MMP9+ tumor-associated macrophages were enriched across IM and MO, which formed cellular niches with regulatory T cells and proliferative/exhausted T cells.Conclusions:Our findings deeply decipher the heterogeneous TMEs between IM and MO, which provide a comprehensive landscape of multifocal HCC.",0
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical health concern in Korea, ranking as the second leading cause of cancer mortality and imposing substantial economic burdens, particularly among the working-age population. This review examines recent advancements in treating advanced HCC, referencing the updated 2022 HCC guidelines and the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer system. Historically, first-line systemic therapies included sorafenib and lenvatinib, with regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab serving as second-line options. Since 2020, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown superior overall survival than sorafenib, leading to the adoption of combination therapies such as atezolizumab with bevacizumab and durvalumab with tremelimumab as first-line treatments. The IMbrave150 study demonstrated that atezolizumab–bevacizumab significantly extended median overall survival and progression-free survival, with the longest survival reported in any phase 3 trial for advanced HCC. Similarly, the HIMALAYA study indicated that durvalumab combined with tremelimumab significantly improved survival rates. Second-line therapies now include regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, nivolumab with ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab, each offering benefits for specific patient populations. Nonetheless, these therapies are associated with side effects that require careful management. Traditional targeted therapies can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular events, and hand-foot skin reactions, whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors may cause immune-related adverse events affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system. Clinicians must be well-versed in these treatments and their potential side effects to provide optimal patient care. The emergence of combination therapies targeting complex biological pathways signifies a new paradigm in HCC treatment, emphasizing the importance of continuous education and vigilant monitoring to optimize patient outcomes.","BACKGROUND & AIMS:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a rapidly changing landscape of treatments. In the past 20 years, numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have aimed at improving outcomes across disease stages. We aimed to analyze the current evidence and identify potential factors influencing response to therapies.METHODS:We conducted a systematic review of phase III RCTs (2002–2020) across disease stages. A meta-analysis was designed to examine the relationship between etiology and outcome after systemic therapies with either tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)/antiangiogenic or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.RESULTS:Out of 10,100 studies identified, 76 were phase III RCTs. Among them, a rigorous screening algorithm identified 49 with high quality including a total of 22,113 patients undergoing adjuvant (n = 7) and primary treatment for early (n = 2), intermediate (n = 7), and advanced (first-line, n = 21; second-line, n = 12) stages of disease. Nine of these trials were positive, 6 treatments have been adopted in guidelines (sorafenib [2 RCTs], lenvatinib, atezolizumab+bevacizumab, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab), but 2 were not (adjuvant CIK cells and sorafenib plus hepatic arterial infusion with FOLFOX). Meta-analysis of 8 trials including 3739 patients revealed ICI therapy to be significantly more effective in patients with viral hepatitis compared with nonviral-related HCC, whereas no differences related to etiology were observed in patients treated with TKI/anti–vascular endothelial growth factor.CONCLUSIONS:Among 49 high-quality RCTs conducted in HCC during 2002–2020, 9 resulted in positive results. A meta-analysis of systemic therapies suggests that immunotherapies may be more effective in viral etiologies.",1
"BackgroundEGFR exon 20 insertion (EGFR ex20ins) mutations account for about 10–12% of all EGFR-mutated tumors, which are usually associated with primary drug resistance to conventional EGFR-TKI therapy and worse survival outcomes, and are currently a major problem for clinicians in clinical management. In recent years, with the rapid improvement of sequencing technology and careful review of clinical data, investigators have gained a deeper understanding and clearer cognition of the clinicopathological features and molecular mechanisms of these EGFR ex20ins mutations.PurposeThe aim of this study was to systemically review the molecular structure and clinical characteristics of EGFR ex20ins mutations, and focus on summarizing the latest data of emerging therapies (including novel small-molecule EGFR-TKI drugs, specific monoclonal antibodies, novel drugs targeting other mechanisms, and immunotherapy) for those patients.ConclusionAdvances in overcoming these systemic challenges have greatly accelerated the development of new drugs targeting EGFR ex20ins, and are committed to designing more rational combination therapies to overcome or delay the emergence of drug resistance, ultimately improve the prognosis of such uncommon mutant populations.","PurposeBecause patients younger than 40 years are rarely enrolled in clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their survival benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) needs to be clarified.MethodsThe National Cancer Database was queried for patients who were diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC between 2016 and 2018. ICIs were administered in the first-line setting. The overall survival (OS) of patients with stage IV NSCLC according to the receipt of ICIs was compared in different age groups (< 40, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years). Multivariate analyses identified the clinical characteristics predictive of OS. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to reduce the biases arising from clinical characteristics.ResultsThis study included 126,476 patients with stage IV NSCLC. In univariate analysis, ICI treatment was not associated with a survival benefit in patients younger than 40 years with stage IV NSCLC relative to their ICI-naïve counterparts after PSM (median OS: 24.2 months vs. 24.0 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81–1.27, P = 0.9031). Multivariate analysis revealed that ICI use was not an independent predictor of OS in patients with stage IV NSCLC < 40 years old (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.76–1.21, P = 0.7230). Sequential improvement of the HR was observed with increasing age.ConclusionOur study suggested a poor survival benefit of ICIs in stage IV NSCLC patients younger than 40 years old, which should be validated in prospective studies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05167-2.",1
"Background and aimsRepeat hepatectomy for adult recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma significantly prolongs the overall survival, but repeat hepatectomy for pediatric recurrent hepatoblastoma (HB) is rarely reported, and the outcomes are warranted to be investigated.MethodsAll patients between May 2015 and December 2020 with recurrent HB after intended surgical cure were retrospectively evaluated. Clinicopathologic features, surgical details and outcomes were analyzed during a median following-up of 24 months after repeat hepatectomy. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier estimate.ResultsA total of 18 patients of recurrent HB undergoing repeat hepatectomy with radical cure intention were included. There were 11 males and 7 females. The median age was 29 months (range 5–87 months) at first hepatectomy, and the median time to the recurrence from the first hepatectomy was 7 months. The operating time of the repeat hepatectomy was 5.0 h (range 3.5–9.0 h) and the mean blood loss was 592 ml (range 50–3200 ml). Radical resection (R0) was achieved in 12 patients (66.7%), with a postoperative hospital stay of 7.9 ± 1.8 days. No serious postoperative complications or mortality occurred. The overall survival (OS) rate was 55.6% (10/18) and the event-free survival (EFS) rate was 33.3% (6/18). Those with no lung metastases, not high-risk stratification, and achieving R0 hepatectomy, anatomic hepatectomy had longer OS rate (all P < 0.05) after repeat hepatectomy. Two of three patients with re-recurrence HB undergoing salvage liver transplantation were alive with a tumor-free survival.ConclusionsRepeat hepatectomy for recurrent HB can be carried out safely. However, only a highly selected subgroup of patients might actually benefit from this procedure.","PurposeDEK::AFF2 fusion-associated squamous cell carcinoma (DEK::AFF2 SCC), also reported in the literature as low-grade papillary sinonasal (Schneiderian) carcinoma (LGPSC), is a rare, primarily bland-appearing, but locally aggressive neoplasm. Morphologically, these tumors can closely resemble sinonasal papilloma (SP), especially on small or limited biopsy, often leading to misdiagnosis. DEK::AFF2 SCC is devoid of the underlying mutually exclusive EGFR or KRAS driver mutations of SP, suggesting it may represent a distinct unique entity.MethodsIn this study, we conducted a retrospective search of “unusual” SP reported either as atypical, dysplastic, or suspicious for malignant transformation at our institution in the last 13 years (2010–2023), to identify potential cases of DEK::AFF2 SCC.ResultsOf the 201 SP cases during this time period, 30 “unusual” SP cases were identified. On morphologic review of these 30 cases, 6 were worrisome for DEK::AFF2 SCC and were selected for AFF2 immunohistochemical stain (IHC), of which 3 cases were positive. All 3 AFF2 IHC positive cases were also positive for DEK::AFF2 fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), thereby, confirming IHC results.ConclusionsThis study highlights that AFF2 IHC can be an invaluable surrogate marker to FISH in identifying DEK::AFF2 SCC in challenging cases to avoid misdiagnosis. Detailed clinical and pathologic data were collected to gain a better understanding of this emerging challenging entity. A literature review was performed to enrich our knowledge of DEK::AFF2 SCC.",0
"Natural killer cells are critical players in the antitumor immune response due to their ability to destroy target cells through cytotoxic activity and other means. However, this response is inhibited in the tumor microenvironment, where a crippling hypoxic environment and several inhibitory molecules bind to NK cells to trigger an anergic state. Inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, NK2GA, KIR, TIGIT, and LAG-3 have been associated with inhibition of NK cells in multiple cancer types. Binding to these receptors leads to loss of cytotoxicity, lower proliferation and metabolic rates, and even apoptosis. While these receptors are important for avoiding auto-immunity, in a pathological setting like malignant neoplasms they are disadvantageous for the individual’s immune system to combat cancer cells. The use of monoclonal antibodies to block these receptors contributes to cancer therapy by preventing the inhibition of NK cells. In this review, the impact of NK cell inhibition and activation on cancer therapy was summarized and an overview of the blockade of inhibitory pathways by monoclonal antibodies was provided.","PurposeHistory of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC) has been associated with survival following the diagnosis of a second primary malignancy (SPM), with the direction of the association varying by cancer type. Research is needed to elucidate the role of other key factors in this association.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients newly diagnosed and/or treated at Moffitt Cancer Center in December 2008–April 2020 with breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL) (n = 29,156). History of KC was obtained from new patient intake questionnaires. Age- and stage-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the association between history of KC and survival following each cancer, stratified by demographic/clinical characteristics.ResultsKC history was most prevalent in patients with melanoma (28.7%), CLL (19.8%) and lung cancer (16.1%). KC history was associated with better overall survival following prostate cancer (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55–0.99) and poorer overall survival following CLL (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.10–2.71). Patients with a history of KC experienced better survival within the first four years of a melanoma diagnosis (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92); whereas poorer survival was observed for patients who survived 7 + years after a melanoma diagnosis (HR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.17–4.05). Stratification by treatment and stage revealed directional differences in the associations between KC history and survival among patients with breast cancer and melanoma.ConclusionsKC history may be a predictor of survival following an SPM, possibly serving as a marker of immune function and/or DNA damage repair capacity.",0
"Increasing evidence indicates that Calumenin (CALU), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is significantly associated with tumor progression. However, the effect of CALU on patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unknown. By integrating multi-omics data and molecular biology experiments, we found that CALU expression was significantly increased in tumors compared with normal tissues, and the pathological grade and prognosis of patients were correlated with CALU expression. Next, knockdown or ectopic expression of CALU could affect the proliferative and invasive abilities of ccRCC cells. Moreover, immune landscape characterization revealed that CALU expression was positively associated with neutrophils and macrophages, whereas it was negatively associated with natural killer T cells and CD8+ T cells. Single-cell sequencing showed that the localization and binding targets of CALU mainly involved monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Sensitivity analysis of common chemotherapeutic drugs showed that high expression of CALU could sensitize chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol, AMG-706 and Cytarabine, but could lead to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as Embelin, Salubrinal and Tipifarnib. We demonstrated a significant correlation between high CALU expression and poor patient survival. Further, we demonstrated a correlation between CALU expression, tumor microenvironment, and the sensitivity of patients to common chemo- and immuno-therapy drugs. Thus, our results indicate that CALU could be a biomarker and designing personalized treatment approaches for ccRCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00169-7.","PurposeItraconazole is an antifungal drug that has been clinically used for over 30 years. In recent years, scholars have discovered that it possesses an anticancer effect. Moreover, its mechanism has been clarified to some degree. What deserves to be mentioned is that itraconazole acting on the Hedgehog pathway has made a new progress in the treatment of cancers. While interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the Hedgehog pathway is largely activated in different cancer cells.ResultThis review tries to highlight the effect of itraconazole on smoothened receptor (SMO) in the Hedgehog pathway, thereby reducing the glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) release and finally exhibiting a range of anticancer effects, promoting apoptosis of cancer cells, and inhibiting proliferation by indirect inhibition of NF-κB pathway and inflammation, moreover, promoting the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, inhibiting the expression of target genes transcribed by GLI such as BCL-2 and Cyclin-D1. Besides, itraconazole increases the number of Bnip3, subsequently, inducing the dissociation of the Beclin-1/BCL-2 binding complex, as a result of ultimately promoting autophagy of cancer cells.ConclusionAs a new anticancer drug, whether itraconazole eventually entering clinical application requires the joint eforts of all scholars. In any case, an in-depth study on itraconazole will bring new hope for cancer patients in the near future.",0

Given the potential for long-term morbidity from immune-related adverse events (irAEs), optimizing the risk-benefit ratio for these agents in the curative neoadjuvant setting is important. Suboptimal clinical response to initial neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is associated with low rates of pCR (2–5%) and may define a patient selection strategy for neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade. We conducted a single-arm phase II study of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel as the second phase of NAT in patients with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)-resistant TNBC (NCT02530489).Methods:Patients with stage I-III, AC-resistant TNBC, defined as disease progression or a <80% reduction in tumor volume after 4 cycles of AC, were eligible. Patients received atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3weeks x4) and nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2 IV,Q1 week x12) as the second phase of NAT before undergoing surgery followed by adjuvant atezolizumab (1200mg IV, Q3 weeks, x4). A two-stage Gehan-type design was employed to detect an improvement in pCR/residual cancer burden class I (RCB-I) rate from 5% to 20%.Results:From 2/15/2016 through 1/29/2021, 37 patients with AC-resistant TNBC were enrolled. The pCR/RCB-I rate was 46%. No new safety signals were observed. Seven patients (19%) discontinued atezolizumab due to irAEs.Conclusion:This study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a promising signal of activity in this high-risk population (pCR/RCB-I=46% vs 5% in historical controls), suggesting that a response-adapted approach to the utilization of neoadjuvant immunotherapy should be considered for further evaluation in a randomized clinical trial.",0
"ABSTRACTAimsStudy on the prognostic characteristics and biomarkers of lung cancer in Xuanwei Patients.Materials and MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on the genetic data of 261 NSCLC patients, as well as the prognostic data of 133 patients. The relationship between prognosis and EGFR mutations in the Xuanwei and non Xuanwei cohorts was compared and analyzed.ResultsThe superior progression-free survival (PFS) in Xuanwei patients was primarily observed in those with EGFR-mutated tumors (p < 0.05). Further analysis of accompanying mutations and TMB levels revealed an association between high TMB and a favorable prognosis in EGFR-mutated Xuanwei NSCLC.ConclusionXuanwei lung cancer differs from non Xuanwei patients in terms of prognosis and tumor mutation burden, and further research should be conducted.","AbstractBackgroundCo-amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGFRvIII, a tumor-specific truncation mutant of EGFR, represent hallmark genetic lesions in glioblastoma.MethodsWe used phospho-proteomics, RNA-sequencing, TCGA data, glioblastoma cell culture, and mouse models to study the signal transduction mediated by EGFR and EGFRvIII.ResultsWe report that EGFR and EGFRvIII stimulate the innate immune defense receptor Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2); and that knockout of TLR2 dramatically improved survival in orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts. EGFR and EGFRvIII activated TLR2 in a ligand-independent manner, promoting tumor growth and immune evasion. We show that EGFR and EGFRvIII cooperate to activate the Rho-associated protein kinase ROCK2, which modulated malignant progression both by activating TLR2 and WNT signaling, and through remodeling the tumor microenvironment.ConclusionsTogether, our findings show that EGFR and EGFRvIII cooperate to drive tumor progression through ROCK2 and downstream WNT-β-catenin/TLR2 signaling pathways.",1
"Background:There is a growing literature base regarding menstrual changes following COVID-19 vaccination among premenopausal people. However, relatively little is known about uterine bleeding in postmenopausal people following COVID-19 vaccination.Objectives:To examine trends in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses over time before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction and describe cases of new-onset postmenopausal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination.Study Design:All analyses focused on members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest ages 45 and older who were diagnosed with incident postmenopausal bleeding in the electronic medical record. Members with pre-existing postmenopausal bleeding or abnormal uterine bleeding, or who were at increased risk of bleeding due to other health conditions, were excluded. We used segmented regression analysis to estimate changes in the incidence of postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses from 2018 through 2021 in Kaiser Permanente Northwest members meeting inclusion criteria, stratified by COVID-19 vaccination status in 2021. Additionally, we identified all members with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccination between December 14, 2020, through August 14, 2021, who had an incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnosis within 60 days of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination, diagnostic procedures, and presumed bleeding etiology were assessed through chart review and described. A temporal scan statistic was run on all cases without clear bleeding etiology.Results:In a population of approximately 80,000 individuals per month there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses before and after COVID-19 vaccine introduction (p=0.59). Among 48,438 vaccinated individuals, 104 had postmenopausal bleeding first diagnosed within 60 days following COVID-19 vaccination; 76% of cases (79/104) were confirmed as post-vaccination postmenopausal bleeding after chart review. Median time from vaccination to bleeding onset was 21 days (range: 2–54 days). Among the 56 postmenopausal bleeding cases with a provider-attributed etiology, the common causes of bleeding were uterine or cervical lesions (50% [28/56]), hormone replacement therapy (13% [7/56]), and proliferative endometrium (13% [7/56]). Among the 23 cases without a clear etiology, there was no statistically significant clustering of postmenopausal bleeding onset following vaccination.Conclusions:Within this integrated health system, introduction of COVID-19 vaccines was not associated with an increase in incident postmenopausal bleeding diagnoses. Diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding in the 60 days following receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination was rare.","Background.There is evidence suggesting that COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with small, transitory effects on uterine bleeding, possibly including menstrual timing, flow, and duration, in some individuals. However, changes in health care seeking, diagnosis, and workup for abnormal uterine bleeding in the COVID-19 vaccine era are less clear.Objectives.To assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation in a large integrated health system.Study Design.Using segmented regression, we assessed whether the availability of COVID-19 vaccines was associated with changes in monthly, population-based rates of incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses compared to the pre-pandemic period in health system members ages 16–44 years who were not menopausal. We also compared clinical and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with incident abnormal uterine bleeding between December 2020 through October 13, 2021 by vaccination status (never vaccinated, vaccinated in the 60 days prior to diagnosis, vaccinated more than 60 days prior to diagnosis) and conducted detailed chart review of patients diagnosed with abnormal uterine bleeding within 1–60 days of COVID-19 vaccination in the same time period.Results.In monthly populations ranging from 79,000 to 85,000 female health system members, incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis per 100,000 person-days ranged from 8.97 to 19.19. There was no significant change in the level or trend in the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses between the pre-pandemic (January 2019-January 2020) and post-COVID-19 vaccine (December 2020-December 2021) periods. A comparison of clinical characteristics of 2,717 abnormal uterine bleeding cases by vaccination status suggested that abnormal bleeding among recently vaccinated patients was similar or less severe than abnormal bleeding among patients who had never been vaccinated patients or those vaccinated more than 60 days prior. There were also significant differences in age and race of patients with incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses by vaccination status: never vaccinated patients were the youngest and those vaccinated more than 60 days prior were the oldest; the proportion of patients who were Black/African American was highest among never vaccinated patients, and the proportion of Asian patients was higher among vaccinated patients. Chart review of 114 confirmed post-vaccination abnormal uterine bleeding cases diagnosed from December 2020 through October 13, 2021 found that the most common symptoms reported were changes in timing, duration, and volume of bleeding. Approximately one-third of cases received no diagnostic workup; 57% had no etiology for the bleeding documented in the electronic health record. In 12% of cases, the patient mentioned or asked about a possible link between their bleeding and their recent COVID-19 vaccine.Conclusions.The availability of COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with a change in incidence of medically attended abnormal uterine bleeding in our population of over 79,000 female patients of reproductive age. Additionally, among 2,717 patients with abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses in the period following COVID-19 vaccine availability, receipt of the vaccine was not associated with greater bleeding severity.",1
"Next-generation sequencing–based genomic testing is standard of care for tumor workflows. However, its application across different institutions continues to be challenging given the diversity of needs and resource availability among different institutions globally. Moreover, the use of a variety of different panels, including those from a few individual genes to those involving hundreds of genes, results in a relatively skewed distribution of care for patients. It is imperative to obtain a higher level of standardization without having to be restricted to specific kits or requiring repeated validations, which are generally expensive. We show the validation and clinical implementation of the DH-CancerSeq assay, a tumor-only whole-exome–based sequencing assay with integrated informatics, while providing similar input requirements, sensitivity, and specificity to a previously validated targeted gene panel and maintaining similar turnaround times for patient care.","SUMMARYInhibition of CDK4/6 kinases has led to improved outcomes in breast cancer. Nevertheless, only a minority of patients experience long-term disease control. Using a large, clinically annotated cohort of patients with metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, we identify TP53 loss (27.6%) and MDM2 amplification (6.4%) to be associated with lack of long-term disease control. Human breast cancer models reveal that p53 loss does not alter CDK4/6 activity or G1 blockade but instead promotes drug-insensitive p130 phosphorylation by CDK2. The persistence of phospho-p130 prevents DREAM complex assembly, enabling cell-cycle re-entry and tumor progression. Inhibitors of CDK2 can overcome p53 loss, leading to geroconversion and manifestation of senescence phenotypes. Complete inhibition of both CDK4/6 and CDK2 kinases appears to be necessary to facilitate long-term response across genomically diverse HR+ breast cancers.",0
"Background and purposeThe intricate mechanisms underlying intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment remain largely elusive. Recently, attention has shifted towards exploring the intercellular signaling mediated by exosomal long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) within this context. This comprehensive systematic review aims to elucidate the functional paradigm of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer.Materials and methodsThe review provides a comprehensive narrative of lncRNA definition, characteristics, as well as the formation, sorting, and uptake processes of exosome-derived lncRNAs. Additionally, it describes comprehensive technology for exosome research and nucleic acid drug loading. This review further systematically examines the cellular origins, functional roles, and underlying mechanisms of exosome-derived lncRNAs in recipient cells within the cancer setting.ResultsThe functional paradigm of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer mainly depends on the source cells and sorting mechanism of exosomal lncRNAs, the recipient cells and uptake mechanisms of exosomal lncRNAs, and the specific molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in recipient cells. The source cells of exosomal lncRNAs mainly involved in the current review included tumor cells, cancer stem cells, normal cells, macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts.ConclusionThis synthesis of knowledge offers valuable insights for accurately identifying exosomal lncRNAs with potential as tumor biomarkers. Moreover, it aids in the selection of appropriate targeting strategies and preclinical models, thereby facilitating the clinical translation of exosomal lncRNAs as promising therapeutic targets against cancer. Through a comprehensive understanding of the functional role of exosome-derived lncRNAs in cancer, this review paves the way for advancements in personalized medicine and improved treatment outcomes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05273-1.","Conventional blood-based biomarkers and radiographic imaging are excellent for use in monitoring different aspects of malignant disease, but given their specific shortcomings, their integration with other, complementary markers such as plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be beneficial toward a precision medicine–driven future. Plasma ctDNA analysis utilizes the measurement of cancer-specific molecular alterations in a variety of bodily fluids released by dying tumor cells to monitor and profile response to therapy, and is being employed in several clinical scenarios. Plasma concentrations of ctDNA have been reported to correlate with tumor burden. However, the strength of this association is generally poor and highly variable, confounding the interpretation of longitudinal plasma ctDNA measurements in conjunction with routine radiographic assessments. Herein is discussed what is currently understood with respect to the fundamental characteristics of tumor growth that dictate plasma ctDNA concentrations, with a perspective on its interpretation in conjunction with radiographically determined tumor burden assessments.",0
"More and more studies have revealed that P2 purinergic receptors play a key role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors can be used as promoters and regulators of CRC and play a dual role in the progression of CRC. CRC microenvironment is rich in ATP and its cleavage products (ADP, AMP, Ado), which act as activators of P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors. The activation of P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors regulates the progression of CRC mainly by regulating the function of immune cells and mediating different signal pathways. In this paper, we focus on the specific mechanisms and functional roles of P2X7, P2Y12, and P2Y2 receptors in the growth and progression of CRC. The antagonistic effects of these selective antagonists of P2X purinergic receptors on the growth, invasion, and metastasis of CRC were further discussed. Moreover, different studies have reported that P2X7 receptor can be used as an effective predictor of patients with CRC. All these indicate that P2 purinergic receptors are a key regulator of CRC. Therefore, antagonizing P2 purinergic receptors may be an innovative treatment for CRC.","Numerous studies have revealed that the ATP-gated ion channel purinergic 2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays an important role in tumor progression and the pathogenesis of cancer pain. P2X7R requires activation by extracellular ATP to perform its regulatory role functions. During tumor development or cancer-induced pain, ATP is released from tumor cells or other cells in the tumor microenvironment (such as tumor-associated immune cells), which activates P2X7R, opens ion channels on the cell membrane, affects intracellular molecular metabolism, and regulates the activity of tumor cells. Furthermore, peripheral organs and receptors can be damaged during tumor progression, and P2X7R expression in nerve cells (such as microglia) is significantly upregulated, enhancing sensory afferent information, sensitizing the central nervous system, and inducing or exacerbating pain. These findings reveal that the ATP-P2X7R signaling axis plays a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of tumors and cancer pain and also has a therapeutic role. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the role of P2X7R in tumors and cancer pain, discussed the pharmacological properties of inhibiting P2X7R activity (such as the use of antagonists) or blocking its expression in the treatment of tumor and cancer pain, and provided an important evidence for the treatment of both in the future.",1
"The fixation and permeabilization of cells are essential for labeling intracellular biomarkers in flow cytometry. However, these chemical treatments often alter fragile targets, such as cell surface and fluorescent proteins (FPs), and can destroy chemically-sensitive fluorescent labels. This reduces measurement accuracy and introduces compromises into sample workflows, leading to losses in data quality. Here, we demonstrate a novel multi-pass flow cytometry approach to address this long-standing problem. Our technique utilizes individual cell barcoding with laser particles, enabling sequential analysis of the same cells with single-cell resolution maintained. Chemically-fragile protein markers and their fluorochrome conjugates are measured prior to destructive sample processing and adjoined to subsequent measurements of intracellular markers after fixation and permeabilization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in accurately measuring intracellular FPs and methanol-sensitive antigens and fluorophores, along with various surface and intracellular markers. This approach significantly enhances assay flexibility, enabling accurate and comprehensive cellular analysis without the constraints of conventional one-time measurement flow cytometry. This innovation paves new avenues in flow cytometry for a wide range of applications in immuno-oncology, stem cell research, and cell biology.","Background and Aims:Ambiguous understanding of tumors and tumor microenvironments (TMEs) hinders accurate diagnosis and available treatment for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) covering intrahepatic metastasis (IM) and multicentric occurrence (MO). Here, we characterized the diverse TMEs of IM and MO identified by whole-exome sequencing at single-cell resolution.Approach and Results:We performed parallel whole-exome sequencing and scRNA-seq on 23 samples from 7 patients to profile their TMEs when major results were validated by immunohistochemistry in the additional cohort. Integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing found that malignant cells in IM showed higher intratumor heterogeneity, stemness, and more activated metabolism than those in MO. Tumors from IM shared similar TMEs while distinct TMEs were noticed in those from MO. Furthermore, CD20+ B cells, plasma cells, and conventional type II dendritic cells (cDC2s) were decreased in IM relative to MO while T cells in IM exhibited a more terminally exhausted capacity with a higher proportion of proliferative/exhausted T cells than that in MO. Both CD20 and CD1C correlated with better prognosis in multifocal HCC. Additionally, MMP9+ tumor-associated macrophages were enriched across IM and MO, which formed cellular niches with regulatory T cells and proliferative/exhausted T cells.Conclusions:Our findings deeply decipher the heterogeneous TMEs between IM and MO, which provide a comprehensive landscape of multifocal HCC.",1
"Background:More than 50% of patients with lung cancer are admitted to the hospital while receiving treatment, which is a burden to patients and the healthcare system. This study characterizes the risk factors and outcomes of patients with lung cancer who were admitted to the hospital.Methods:A multidisciplinary oncology care team conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients with lung cancer admitted in 2018. Demographics, disease and admission characteristics, and end-of-life care utilization were recorded. Following a multidisciplinary consensus review process, admissions were determined to be either “avoidable” or “unavoidable.” Generalized estimating equation logistic regression models assessed risks and outcomes associated with avoidable admissions.Results:In all, 319 admissions for 188 patients with a median age of 66 years (IQR, 59–74 years) were included. Cancer-related symptoms accounted for 65% of hospitalizations. Common causes of unavoidable hospitalizations were unexpected disease progression causing symptoms, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, and infection. Of the 47 hospitalizations identified as avoidable (15%), the median overall survival was 1.6 months compared with 9.7 months (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.34–3.19; P<.001) for unavoidable hospitalizations. Significant reasons for avoidable admissions included cancer-related pain (P = .02), hypervolemia (P = .03), patient desire to initiate hospice services (P = .01), and errors in medication reconciliation or distribution (P<.001). Errors in medication management caused 26% of the avoidable hospitalizations. Of admissions in patients receiving immunotherapy (n = 102) or targeted therapy (n = 44), 9% were due to adverse effects of treatment. Patients receiving immunotherapy and targeted therapy were at similar risk of avoidable hospitalizations compared with patients not receiving treatment (P = .3 and P = .1, respectively).Conclusions:We found that 15% of hospitalizations among patients with lung cancer were potentially avoidable. Uncontrolled symptoms, delayed implementation of end-of-life care, and errors in medication reconciliation were associated with avoidable inpatient admissions. Symptom management tools, palliative care integration, and medication reconciliations may mitigate hospitalization risk.","Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy. PTEN is a negative regulator of PI3K signaling and is deficient in > 50% of primary human endometrial cancer. Amplification of ERBB2 promotes tumorigenesis and pathogenesis of several human cancers. However, the effect of ERBB2 targeting has not been studied in endometrial cancer with PTEN mutations. The murine model Pgrcre/+Erbb2f/fPtenf/f (Erbb2d/d Ptend/d) was developed to evaluate the effect of ERBB2 targeted therapy in endometrial cancer with PTEN deficiency. Histopathological and molecular analysis was performed for Ptend/d and Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice. Histopathological analysis revealed that Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice significantly reduced development and progression of endometrial cancer compared to Ptend/d mice. Furthermore, percentages of proliferative cells in Erbb2d/dPtend/d mice revealed anti-tumorigenic effect of Erbb2 ablation compared to Ptend/d mice. Our results demonstrate that Erbb2 ablation reveals a significant suppression of tumorigenesis on endometrial cancer of Ptend/d mice. Our results suggest that Erbb2 functions as an oncogene in endometrial cancer of Ptend/d mice implying that Erbb2 targeting can be used as an effective therapeutic approach for treatment of endometrial cancer with PTEN deficiency to hinder cancer development.",0
"AbstractBackgroundHuman gliomas are classified using isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status as a prognosticator; however, the influence of genetic differences and treatment effects on ensuing immunity remains unclear.MethodsIn this study, we used sequential single-cell transcriptomics on 144 678 and spectral cytometry on over 2 million immune cells encompassing 48 human gliomas to decipher their immune landscape.ResultsWe identified 22 distinct immune cell types that contribute to glioma immunity. Specifically, brain-resident microglia (MG) were reduced with a concomitant increase in CD8+ T lymphocytes during glioma recurrence independent of IDH status. In contrast, IDH-wild type-associated patterns, such as an abundance of antigen-presenting cell-like MG and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, were observed. Beyond elucidating the differences in IDH, relapse, and treatment-associated immunity, we discovered novel inflammatory MG subpopulations expressing granulysin, a cytotoxic peptide that is otherwise expressed in lymphocytes only. Furthermore, we provide a robust genomic framework for defining macrophage polarization beyond M1/M2 paradigm and reference signatures of glioma-specific tumor immune microenvironment (termed GlioTIME-36) for deconvoluting transcriptomic datasets.ConclusionsThis study provides advanced optics of the human pan-glioma immune contexture as a valuable guide for translational and clinical applications.","AbstractClinical trials using immune checkpoint inhibition(ICI) have traditionally failed in glioblastoma (GBM). Viral mimicry, which augments anti-tumor immune responses and sensitizes response to immunotherapy in other cancers, involves the epigenetic activation of endogenous retroelements (REs). REs are silenced via the HUSH complex and H3K9me3. This process is mediated by ZNF638. We aimed to elucidate the role of viral mimicry in enhancing ICI through epigenetic reprogramming of the HUSH complex. We demonstrated that RE expression among 48 superfamilies inversely correlated with ZNF638 expression in gliomas, based on data from 71 newly-diagnosed GBMs. Using transcriptional deconvolution, we showed ZNF638 negatively correlates with innate antiviral immune response signatures(TLR3)(RTLR3=-0.300,pTLR3=0.00006). We validated these in-silico results in pure glioma cell lines, patient-derived GBM neurospheres, and syngeneic murine models. ZNF638 knockdown induced intracellular RE-mediated dsRNA signaling cascades via RIG-I and TLR3. This knockdown significantly increased PD-L1 expression(p<0.001), reduced H3K9 trimethylation, and enhanced cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation in glioma cell lines. In patient-derived GBM neurospheres, ZNF638 knockdown upregulated immune and antiviral programs. Additionally, knockdown resulted in upregulation of several endogenous repeat elements (Alu, LTR). Single-cell RNA sequencing showed ZNF638 clustering in neural progenitor-like and oligodendrocyte-like cells, with increased retroelement expression in low ZNF638 cells. Tumors with lower ZNF638 expression showed increased CD8+ populations. Bulk RNA sequencing deconvolution revealed that ZNF638 is linked to reduced CD8 and DC infiltration in gliomas (RCD8=-0.202,RDC=-0.198;pCD8=8.79E-06,pDC=1.34E-05). In immunocompetent mice, ZNF638 KO and PD-L1 inhibition significantly improved survival (mOS >50 days, p<0.0001) and reduced tumor volume (p<0.001). Analysis of cohorts from multiple cancer types treated with anti-PD1 therapy demonstrated that ZNF638 expression predicts therapeutic response and overall survival. Our findings suggest that epigenetic reprogramming through HUSH inhibition may potentiate immunotherapy for GBM.",0
"This article considers the concept of designing Phase I clinical trials using both clinician- and patient-reported outcomes to adaptively allocate study participants to tolerable doses and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) at the study conclusion. We describe a new isotonic patient-reported outcome (PRO-ISO) Phase I design with the flexibility of allocating patients to lower, more tolerable regimens if a large number of PRO-DLT events are seen at higher doses. We conduct simulation studies of the operating characteristics of the design and compared them to the patient-reported outcomes continual reassessment method (PRO-CRM). We illustrate that the PRO-ISO makes appropriate dose assignments during the study to give investigators and reviewers an idea of how the method behaves. In simulation studies, the PRO-ISO demonstrates comparable performance to the PRO-CRM in terms of recommending target doses and allocating patients to these doses. It also performs well relative to a nonparametric optimal benchmark applied to the PRO setting. Finally, we extend our methodology to account for the problem of late-onset toxicities.","We develop a family of mathematical models to predict patient-specific response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. The models capture key features of tumor growth, therapeutic response, and tissue mechanics that are informed by diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. We then calibrate the models to synthetic and clinical data using Bayesian inference to give a description of the parameter uncertainties. Given the family of models and the calibration scheme, we perform three analyses. First, we test the identifiability of each model; that is, given synthetic data with the same level of noise as that seen in the clinical setting, are we able to accurately recover parameter values employed to generate the data? Second, we test the identifiability of the framework itself; that is, when data is generated by one model from the family, is that model selected as the best one during the calibration? Third, we apply our model family to predict patient-specific response on a cohort of 32 patients with triple negative breast cancer. For analysis 1, we show that we can recover the parameters used to generate synthetic data (with 5%, 10%, and 15% Gaussian noise − greater than that typically seen in magnetic resonance imaging in the clinical setting) with a mean error of 5.9% (+/−1.4%). For analysis 2, the model used to generate the data is selected as the best model for over 50% of the synthetic data sets, provided that the noise level in the synthetic data is less than 10%. For analysis 3, we show that the calibrated drug efficacy rate in the diffusion and proliferation mechanically coupled, drug informed, reaction diffusion model strongly correlates with patient response to therapy with an area under the curve score of 0.85 in a receiver operator characteristic analysis. Thus, our framework shows that, within the noise levels encountered in the clinical setting, a high level of rigor can be achieved for mathematical model parameterizations and selections, and this translates into high accuracy for predicting responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant therapy.",0
ABSTRACTMedulloblastoma (MB) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in children. MB originates from neural precursor cells in distinctive regions of the rhombic lip and their maturation occurs in the cerebellum or the brain stem during embryonal development. Autophagy is also referred to as self-eating’ which is a catabolic process that often triggers cellular homeostasis through the salvaging of degenerated proteins as well as organelles. Autophagy influence cell survival via aberrant proteins that could accumulate within the cell and influence potential signaling and transport mechanisms. The role of autophagy in MB aggressiveness as well as tumorigenesis is a very complex process. This review targets specifically data reporting the key roles of autophagy in the pathogenesis and therapy of MB.,"ABSTRACTSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) has been proved to be able to effectively down-regulate gene expression through the RNAi mechanism. Thus, siRNA-based drugs have become one of the hottest research directions due to their high efficiency and specificity. However, challenges such as instability, off-target effects and immune activation hinder their clinical application. This review explores the mechanisms of siRNA and the challenges in siRNA-based tumor therapy. It highlights the use of various nanomaterials – including lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and inorganic nanoparticles – as carriers for siRNA delivery in different therapeutic modalities. The application strategies of siRNA-based nanomedicine in chemotherapy, phototherapy and immunotherapy are discussed in detail, along with recent clinical advancements.

"Rationale:Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a successful treatment for B-cell malignancies associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Cardiovascular toxicities have also been reported in this setting. However, there is scarce data regarding development of autonomic disorders after CAR-T cell therapy.Patient concerns:We report a case with a patient with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, refractory to 2 prior lines of immunochemotherapy, treated with CAR-T therapy.Diagnoses:Orthostatic hypotension secondary to autonomic dysfunction was diagnosed as manifestation of ICANS.Interventions:The patient received metilprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily for 3 days and anakinra 100 mg IV every 6h.Outcomes:The vast majority of autonomic symptoms ceased and 4 months after CAR-T therapy, autonomic dysfunction was resolved.Lessons:New-onset autonomic dysfunction can occur as manifestation of ICANS in patients who experience persistent neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms after resolution of acute neurotoxicity and should be early recognized. Differences in differential diagnosis, mechanisms and treatment approaches are discussed.","PurposeNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is ranked the top otorhinolaryngology malignant tumors in the world. However, the general prognosis of recurrent and metastatic (R/M) nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) remains poor, and current surgery and chemoradiotherapy do not generate satisfactory outcomes.MethodsAs a new therapeutic choice, immunotherapy, especially with regard to the development of checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors have made considerable progress in recent years. As Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with increased risk of NPC, EBV-related immunotherapy may lead to a breakthrough in advanced NPCs.ResultsIn this review, we summarized the clinical characters of NPC, and several past and ongoing clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors and EBV-CTLs (CTLs: cytotoxic T lymphocytes) in R/M NPC immunotherapy.ConclusionWe conclude that although the evaluated effects of new immunotherapy drugs have brought us hope on NPC treatment, further phase II-III trials with larger samples are still required to improve the proportion and scheme of drug collocation for better clinical outcomes and less drug-related safety.",0
"AbstractBackgroundDiffuse midline glioma (DMG) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in children. All previous studies examining the role of systemic agents have failed to demonstrate a survival benefit; the only standard of care is radiation therapy (RT). Successful implementation of radiosensitization strategies in DMG remains an essential and promising avenue of investigation. We explore the use of Napabucasin, an NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1)-bioactivatable reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducer, as a potential therapeutic radiosensitizer in DMG.MethodsIn this study, we conduct in vitro and in vivo assays using patient-derived DMG cultures to elucidate the mechanism of action of Napabucasin and its radiosensitizing properties. As penetration of systemic therapy through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a significant limitation to the success of DMG therapies, we explore focused ultrasound (FUS) and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to overcome the BBB and maximize therapeutic efficacy.ResultsNapabucasin is a potent ROS-inducer and radiosensitizer in DMG, and treatment-mediated ROS production and cytotoxicity are dependent on NQO1. In subcutaneous xenograft models, combination therapy with RT improves local control. After optimizing targeted drug delivery using CED in an orthotopic mouse model, we establish the novel feasibility and survival benefit of CED of Napabucasin concurrent with RT.ConclusionsAs nearly all DMG patients will receive RT as part of their treatment course, our validation of the efficacy of radiosensitizing therapy using CED to prolong survival in DMG opens the door for exciting novel studies of alternative radiosensitization strategies in this devastating disease while overcoming limitations of the BBB.","AbstractMelanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be challenging to treat, especially in advanced stages. Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment modalities for melanoma, but its efficacy can be limited due to the radioresistance of melanoma cells. Recently, there has been growing interest in using high-Z metal nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy for melanoma. This review provides an overview of the current state of radiotherapy for melanoma and discusses the physical and biological mechanisms of radiosensitization through high-Z metal NPs. Additionally, it summarizes the latest research on using high-Z metal NPs to sensitize melanoma cells to radiation, both in vitro and in vivo. By examining the available evidence, this review aims to shed light on the potential of high-Z metal NPs in improving radiotherapy outcomes for patients with melanoma.",1
"BackgroundThe survival benefit of first-line epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy in super-elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring active EGFR mutations remains unclear.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective evaluation of the difference in the overall survival (OS) among super-elderly (aged ≥ 85 years) NSCLC patients who had received best supportive care alone (BSC group, n = 36), cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT group, n = 11) or EGFR-TKI therapy (TKI group, n = 22).ResultsThe median age of the patients was 88 years. Among the 35 super-elderly NSCLC patients with an performance status (PS) score of 0–2, 11of 18 EGFR wild-type patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy and 15 of 17 EGFR-mutant patients received EGFR-TKI therapy with gefitinib (n = 13) or osimertinib (n = 2). The OS tended to be longer in the TKI group than in the CT or BSC group (16.9 months vs. 7.2 months or 9.8 months, p = 0.059). Among the 34 super-elderly NSCLC patients with a PS score of 3–4, 7 with EGFR-mutant received gefitinib therapy and the remaining 27 received BSC alone. The OS tended to be longer in the TKI group than in the BSC group (4.6 months vs. 2.3 months, p = 0.060). Multivariate analysis identified a good PS before the start of first-line therapy and presence of active EGFR mutations reduced a risk of death.ConclusionsGefitinib appears to be useful as a salvage therapy in super-elderly NSCLC patients with active EGFR mutation, regardless of their PS.","IntroductionOsimertinib, an irreversible third-generation EGFR-TKI, is the standard of care for second-line treatment of T790M-mutant advanced NSCLC patients whose disease progressed after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. In this multicenter study, we aimed to determine the real-life efficacy and safety of Osimertinib in pretreated advanced NSCLC patients with T790M mutation.Materials and methodsThis retrospective trial included advanced T790M-mutant pretreated NSCLC patients who received Osimertinib from 24 different centers in Turkey. Primary endpoint was time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety.ResultsOf 163 patients, 68.7% had EGFR exon 19 deletion and 22.7% had exon 21 L858R mutation. Osimertinib was given as second-line treatment in 96 patients (58.9%) and third-line in 48 patients (29.4%). After median of 13-month follow-up, median TTD was 21.6 months with an 82.2% ORR. Estimated median OS was 32.1 months. Grade 3–4 adverse events were seen in 11.7% of the patients.ConclusionOsimertinib is a highly effective option in second- or third-line treatment of NSCLC patients with T790M mutation, with a favorable safety profile.",1
"BackgroundGastric cancer (GC) remains a global challenge due to its high morbidity and mortality rates especially in Asia as well as poor response to treatment. As a member of the adhesion protein family and transmembrane glycoprotein, EpCAM expressed excessively in cancer cells including GC cells. The database assay showed that EpCAM is excessively expressed and easily mutated in cancers, especially in early stage of GC.MethodsTo explore the roles EpCAM plays in oncogenesis and progression of GC, the expression of EpCAM was deleted in GC cells with CRISPR/Cas9 method, and then the changes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility and motility associated microstructures in EpCAM-deleted GC cells (EpCAM-/-SGC7901) were detected to evaluate the rules EpCAM played.ResultsThe results showed that EpCAM deletion caused cell proliferation, motility and the development of motility-relevant microstructures inhibited significantly, apoptotic trend and contact inhibition enhanced in EpCAM-deleted GC cells. The results of western blot suggested that EpCAM modulates the expression of epithelial/endothelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) correlated genes. All results as above indicated that EpCAM plays important roles to enhance the oncogenesis, malignancy and progression as a GC enhancer.ConclusionsCombining our results and published data together, the interaction of EpCAM with other proteins was also discussed and concluded in the discussion. Our results support that EpCAM can be considered as a novel target for the diagnosis and therapy of GC in future.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04767-2.","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification. M6A RNA methylation is reversible: m6A is installed by “writers”, removed by “erasers”, and recognized by “readers”. Readers are executors to regulate RNA metabolism by recognizing specific m6A sites, including RNA splicing, export, translation and decay. YTHDF2 is the first identified m6A reader protein. YTHDF2 interacts with m6A-containing transcripts to accelerate the degradation process and regulate various biological processes, such as viral infection, stem cell development and cancer progression. Although there are some reviews about m6A modification in physiological and pathological processes, few reviews focus on roles of YTHDF2 in cancers to date. Therefore, in this review, we attempted to systematically summarize m6A reader protein YTHDF2: its structure, mechanisms in regulating RNA metabolism, roles in cancer progression and potential application for cancer treatment, which might inspire new ideas for m6A research in cancers and provide novel insights into cancer treatment.",1
"Apoptosis is the most prominent mode of programmed cell death and is necessary for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During cell apoptosis, a distinctive population of extracellular vesicles is generated, termed apoptotic vesicles (apoVs). ApoVs inherit a variety of biological molecules such as proteins, RNAs, nuclear components, lipids, and gasotransmitters from their parent cells. ApoVs have shown promising therapeutic potential for inflammation, tumors, immune disorders, and tissue regeneration. In addition, apoVs can be used as drug carriers, vaccine development, and disease diagnosis. Recently, apoVs have been used in clinical trials to treat a variety of diseases, such as temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis and the regeneration of functional alveolar bone. Here, we review the history of apoV research, current preclinical and clinical studies, and the potential issues of apoV application.","ABSTRACTExtremity soft tissue sarcoma (ESTS) is a rare malignant nonepithelial disease, calling for combined modality treatments with surgery to further improve local control rates and long-term survival, especially in patients with multiple local recurrences with or without risk of amputation.

"AbstractSuperficial cancers typically refer to cancers confined to the surface layers of tissue. Low-targeting therapies or side effects prompt exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), due to their unique optical properties, serve as effective photosensitizers, enabling tumor ablation through photothermal therapy (PTT). PTT induced by AuNPs can be achieved through light sources externally applied to the skin. Near-infrared radiation is the main light candidate due to its deep tissue penetration capability. This review explores recent advancements in AuNP-based PTT for superficial cancers, specifically breast, head and neck, thyroid, bladder and prostate cancers. Additionally, challenges and future directions in utilizing AuNPs for cancer treatment are discussed, emphasizing the importance of balancing efficacy with safety in clinical applications.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is a health concern affecting millions of men globally, with a concerning rise in incidence in the Philippines, a country that faces a complex set of barriers to equitable access to quality PCa care. In this article, we describe the unique geographic, economic, socio-cultural, and political factors that influence access to screening, diagnosis, treatment, and supportive services in the country, and explore avenues for development. The country lacks a nationwide PCa registry to inform resource allocation and guide PCa cancer care programs and policy. Misconceptions, cultural barriers and negative attitudes about PCa among Filipino men adversely influence health-seeking behavior. Inadequate insurance coverage, and high out-of-pocket costs obstruct access to essential care. Geographic and political factors contribute to the uneven distribution of healthcare resources needed for comprehensive PCa care, including access to medical specialists, essential medicines, and surgical and radiotherapeutic equipment. Overcoming these challenges requires a collaborative effort encompassing robust data collection, awareness campaigns to reshape societal norms, policy and economic reforms, infrastructure improvements, and enhanced collaboration among healthcare professionals to provide evidence-based care. Addressing these issues holistically can pave the way to better outcomes and improved quality of life for Filipino men with this life-altering disease.",1
"ObjectivesThe aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with recurrent and metastatic sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and evaluate the current treatment strategies to help guide future management.DesignThis is a retrospective cohort study.SettingThe study was conducted at six international tertiary treatment centers.ParticipantsPatients with documented diagnoses of recurrent or metastatic SNUC since 1983 were included in the study.Main Outcome MeasuresPatient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected. Primary outcome measures included disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS), and time to recurrence (TTR) following initial treatment. Further univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess for prognostic factors.Results A total of 97 patients with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 52.4 (15.6) were identified, 15 of whom presented with metastatic SNUC and 90 of whom developed recurrence. Management in both populations was widely variable. For patients with metastatic disease, the 1-year DSS probability was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8–100%). For patients with recurrent SNUC, the 1- and 5-year DSS probabilities were 45.7% (95% CI, 31.9–65.6%) and 8.6% (95% CI, 2.9–25.3%), respectively. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) TTR was 8 months (3–18.5 months). Multivariable analyses revealed a significant association between orbital involvement on initial presentation and TTR (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.28; 95% CI, 1.45–7.42; p = 0.004). ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study addressing metastatic and recurrent SNUC based on a large patient cohort. Orbital extension of the primary SNUC may predict a higher probability of recurrence following treatment, suggesting the possible utility of a more aggressive treatment in this subgroup of patients. A heterogenous patient population and wide variability in management emphasize the challenges in standardizing care; however, dismal survival rates demonstrate the necessity for further evaluation of current approaches to improve evidence-based recommendations.","Aim: To develop and validate a T2-weighted-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) images-based radiomics model for predicting early postoperative recurrence (within 1 year) in patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs).Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed by collecting clinical, pathological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from patients with LGG between 2017 and 2022. Regions of interest were delineated and radiomic features were extracted from T2-FLAIR images using 3D-Slicer software. To minimize redundant features, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression algorithm was used. Patients were categorized into two groups based on recurrence status: the recurrence group (RG) and the non-recurrence group (NRG). Radiomic features were used to develop models using three machine learning approaches: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the radiomic features was validated using fivefold cross-validation.Results: After rigorous screening, 105 patients met the inclusion criteria, and five radiomic features were identified. After 5-folds cross-validation, the average areas under the curves for LR, RF and SVM were 0.813, 0.741 and 0.772, respectively.Conclusion: T2-FLAIR-based radiomic features effectively predicted early recurrence in postoperative LGGs.",1
"Introduction/ObjectiveThe spread of tumors (48% in men and 51% in women), as well as the protection of malignant tumors by stromal cells and complex blood vessels, pose significant challenges to drug delivery to tumors. Modern chemotherapy, on the other hand, addresses tumor growth suppression by at least 60% through versatile formulation systems and numerous modifications to drug delivery systems. The renewable and naturally occurring polymers present invariably in all living cells form the fundamental foundation for most anticancer drug development. The review aims to discuss in detail the preparations of polysaccharide, lipid, and protein-based drug-loading vehicles for the targeted delivery of prominent anticancer drugs. It also provides an explanation of drug distribution in blood (cumulative releases of nearly 80% drug) and drug accumulation at tumor sites (1–5 mg/kg) due to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR).MethodsSpecific delivery examples for treating colorectal and breast carcinomas have been presented to distinguish the varied drug administration, bioavailability, and tumor internalization mechanisms between sugar, fatty acid, and amino acid polymers. Current therapy possibilities based on cutting-edge literature are provided, along with drug delivery systems tailored to tumor location and invasive properties.ResultsThe unique combinations of the three natural polymers provide unparalleled solutions to minimize the toxicity (<20% drug release) of the chemotherapeutic drugs on normal tissues. Moreover, the development of a consolidated drug delivery system has contributed to a substantial reduction (dose reduction from 10.43 µM to 1.9 µM) in the undesirable consequences of higher dosages of chemotherapeutic drugs.ConclusionThe review extensively covers safe chemotherapeutic systems with significant advantages (tumor volume shrinkage of 4T1 cells from 1000 mm3 to 200 mm3) in clinical applications of carcinoma treatments using natural polymers.","Endosomolytic vaccine nanocarriers can potentiate cellular immune responses by enhancing cross-presentation. We recently developed a cationic polymer–lytic peptide conjugate (VIPER) that greatly improves endosomal escape and intracellular activity of nucleic acid cargoes; furthermore, we hypothesize that VIPER’s unique mechanism of endosomal disruption can increase cytoplasmic delivery of other biomacromolecules (for example, peptides). Herein, we formulate VIPER as a polyplex subunit vaccine composed of conjugated peptide antigens and electrostatically complexed poly(I:C) nucleic acid adjuvant and evaluate whether the presence of the lytic peptide melittin conjugated to the pH-responsive micelle core improves vaccination outcomes. Although VIPER delivers peptide antigens intracellularly, disrupts endosomes in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vitro, and generates strong antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo, significantly enhanced cross-presentation is only observed in conjunction with VIPER-induced local cell death. While these results demonstrate that VIPER is a useful platform technology for the study of vaccine delivery, full elucidation of how endosomal disruption by VIPER improves vaccination outcomes will require decoupling of endosomolysis from cytotoxicity, as well as precise targeting of VIPER vaccine formulations to APC populations in vivo.",1
"PurposeEpidermal growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR–TKIs) are the first-line therapy for patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) harboring activating EGFR mutations. However, the emergence of drug resistance to EGFR–TKIs remains a critical obstacle for successful treatment and is associated with poor patient outcomes. The overarching objective of this study is to apply bioinformatics tools to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying resistance to EGFR–TKIs and develop a robust predictive model.MethodsThe genes associated with gefitinib resistance in the LUAD cell Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were identified using gene chip expression data. Functional enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration analysis were performed to comprehensively explore the mechanism of gefitinib resistance. Furthermore, a GRRG_score was constructed by integrating genes related to LUAD prognosis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database with the screened Gefitinib Resistant Related differentially expressed genes (GRRDEGs) using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) features and their association with immune infiltration between different GRRG_score groups. A prognostic model for LUAD was developed based on the GRRG_score and validated. The HPA database was used to validate protein expression. The CTR-DB database was utilized to validate the results of drug therapy prediction based on the relevant genes.ResultsA total of 110 differentially expression genes were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in Mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, Sphingolipid metabolism. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that biological processes strongly correlated with gefitinib resistance were cell proliferation and immune-related pathways, EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION, APICAL_SURFACE, and APICAL_JUNCTION were highly expressed in the drug-resistant group; KRAS_SIGNALING_DN, HYPOXIA, and HEDGEHOG_SIGNALING were highly expressed in the drug-resistant group. The GRRG_score was constructed based on the expression levels of 13 genes, including HSPA2, ATP8B3, SPOCK1, EIF6, NUP62CL, BCAR3, PCSK9, NT5E, FLNC, KRT8, FSCN1, ANGPTL4, and ID1. We further screened and validated two key genes, namely, NUP62CL and KRT8, which exhibited predictive value for both prognosis and drug resistance.ConclusionsOur study identified several novel GRRDEGs and provided insight into the underlying mechanisms of gefitinib resistance in LUAD. Our results have implications for developing more effective treatment strategies and prognostic models for LUAD patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05129-8.","CLIC5 encoded protein associates with actin-based cytoskeletal and is increasingly thought to play significant roles in human cancers. We use TCGA and GEO to explore CLIC5 expression differences, mutation and DNA methylation, TMB, MSI, and immune cell infiltration. We verified the mRNA expression of CLIC5 in human ovarian cancer cells by real-time PCR and detected the expression of CLIC5 as well as immune marker genes in ovarian cancer by immunohistochemistry. The pan-cancer analysis showed that CLIC5 is highly expressed in several malignant tumors. In some cancers, CLIC5 expression in tumor samples is associated with poorer overall survival. For example, patients with ovarian cancer with high expression of CLIC5 have a poor prognosis. CLIC5 mutation frequency increased in all tumor types. The CLIC5 promoter is hypomethylated in most tumors. CLIC5 was associated with tumor immunity and different immune cells of different tumor types, such as CD8 + T cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, etc. CLIC5 was positively correlated with various immune checkpoints, and TMB and MSI were correlated with dysregulation of CLIC5 in tumors. The expression of CLIC5 in ovarian cancer was detected by qPCR and IHC, and the results were consistent with the bioinformatics results. There were a strong positive correlation between CLIC5 expression and M2 macrophage (CD163) infiltration and a negative correlation with CD8 + T-cell infiltration. In conclusions, our first pan-cancer analysis offered a detailed grasp of the cancerogenic functions of CLIC5 in a variety of malignancies. CLIC5 participated in immunomodulation and performed a crucial function in the tumor microenvironment.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04927-4.",1
"Herein, we performed a virtual screening study to discover new scaffolds for small molecule-based ligands of the immune checkpoint lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the LAG-3 structure revealed two putative binding sites for small molecules: the antibody interface and the lipophilic canyon. A 3D pharmacophore screening resulted in the identification of potential ligands for these binding sites and afforded a library of 25 compounds. We then evaluated the screening hits for LAG-3 binding via microscale thermophoresis (MST) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Our biophysical screening identified two binders with KD values in the low micromolar range, compounds 3 (antibody interface) and 25 (lipophilic canyon). Furthermore, we investigated the ability of LAG-3 hits to engage LAG-3 on a cellular level using a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). In summary, compound 3 shows potential as a lead but is not yet a development candidate.","AbstractNecroptosis, a cell death mechanism with the characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer therapy. Induction of necroptosis for cancer therapy may be possible through the regulation of the expression of a key factor gene receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3 (RIPK3) via in vitro transcription (IVT) mRNA delivery. However, mRNA is susceptible to degradation and has a low delivery efficiency, which highlights the requirement of a proper delivery vehicle for intracellular delivery. Therefore, a new mRNA delivery system based on the nanostructured silica nanoparticles, termed mRNA‐protective nanocage (mPN) has been developed. High‐efficiency expression of RIPK3 and induction of necroptosis is achieved through delivery of RIPK3 IVT mRNA with mPN in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, the mPN carrying RIPK3 mRNA distributed locally in tumors upon intravascular injection, and successfully induced necroptosis and immune cell infiltration, a hallmark of necroptosis. the suppression of tumor growth in a murine cancer model, demonstrating the synergistic effect of RIPK3 mRNA‐ and immune cell‐mediated therapy is also observed. These findings suggest the potential for anticancer therapy through necroptosis induction and provide a strategy for the development of mRNA‐based nanomedicine.",0
"BackgroundThe efficacy of adding atezolizumab to the platinum doublet regimen for extensive disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) remains marginally limited.MethodsWe retrospectively assessed the real-world efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in addition to carboplatin and etoposide (EP + A), versus carboplatin and etoposide (EP) alone in previously untreated ED-SCLC patients.ResultsFrom a total of 99 patients, 46 were assigned to the EP + A group, and 53 to the EP group. No significant difference was observed in progression-free survival between the groups. However, the overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in the EP + A group (20.8 vs 12.1 months; HR: 0.52; p = 0.0127). Patients older than 70 years, male, with performance status 0–1, without liver metastasis, and low levels of C-reactive protein and neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, experienced longer OS in the EP + A group compared to the EP group.ConclusionThe addition of atezolizumab to the platinum doublet regimen significantly extended OS in ED-SCLC patients, particularly among certain subgroups, suggesting its potential value in personalized treatment strategies. Further investigation is warranted to validate these findings.","PurposeIdentifying patients at high risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that impede the achievement of durable efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade therapy is important in improving their management. Identification of a novel predictive factor of therapeutic benefit is also important in improving patient selection for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Further determinants driving response and linking with irAEs are urgently required.MethodsTo address these unmet needs in the field, we explored whether 27 soluble checkpoint proteins and immunomodulatory proteins in serum at the therapy baseline and after week 3 were associated with irAE onset and therapeutic efficacy using MILLIPLEX Human Immuno-Oncology Checkpoint Protein Panel assays in a prospective, multicenter cohort of 81 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving atezolizumab monotherapy.ResultsBy competing-risks regression analysis, we identified that high levels of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) at baseline were a significant and strong risk factor of irAEs (hazard ratio, 5.61; 95% confidence interval, 2.43–12.96; P < 0.0001). We also identified that increased inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) during the first therapeutic cycle was an independent factor associated with prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival.ConclusionThese findings are in keeping with the reported mechanistic basis of these molecules and may provide potential guidance for clinical decision-making to improve patient care. Further validation studies are warranted.Trial registration UMIN000035616 (January 28, 2019)Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04193-w.",1
"BackgroundNeuroinflammation participates in the pathogenesis of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); however, no effective treatments exist. MicroRNAs regulate several aspects of neuronal dysfunction. In a previous study, we found that exosomal miR-486-3p is involved in the pathophysiology of SAH. Targeted delivery of miR-486-3p without blood-brain barrier (BBB) restriction to alleviate SAH is a promising neuroinflammation approach.MethodsIn this study, we modified exosomes (Exo) to form an RVG-miR-486-3p-Exo (Exo/miR) to achieve targeted delivery of miR-486-3p to the brain. Neurological scores, brain water content, BBB damage, flow cytometry and FJC staining were used to determine the effect of miR-486-3p on SAH. Western blot analysis, ELISA and RT-qPCR were used to measure relevant protein and mRNA levels. Immunofluorescence staining and laser confocal detection were used to measure the expression of mitochondria, lysosomes and autophagosomes, and transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the level of mitophagy in the brain tissue of mice after SAH.ResultsTail vein injection of Exo/miR improved targeting of miR-486-3p to the brains of SAH mice. The injection reduced levels of neuroinflammation-related factors by changing the phenotype switching of microglia, inhibiting the expression of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) and enhancing mitophagy. miR-486-3p treatment alleviated neurobehavioral disorders, brain oedema, BBB damage and neurodegeneration. Further research found that the mechanism was achieved by regulating the acetylation level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator l alpha (PGC-1α) after SIRT2 enters the nucleus.ConclusionExo/miR treatment attenuates neuroinflammation after SAH by inhibiting SIRT2 expression and stimulating mitophagy, suggesting potential clinical applications.","Background and aimAccording to previous reports, GTPase of immunity-associated protein 6 (GIMAP6) is essential for autophagy. However, it is unclear how GIMAP6 affects the development and tumor immunity of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).MethodsIn the present study, the role of GIMAP6 in vivo and in vitro was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting, and Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and Transwell assays. Datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were thoroughly analyzed using R software. A nomogram was created using GIMAP6 and prognostic characteristics. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were applied to explore the potential mechanism of GIMAP6 in lung cancer. The link between GIMAP6 and the immunological landscape was studied using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0 and Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub.ResultsPatients with high GIMAP6 expression had improved overall and disease-specific survival compared with those patients with low GIMAP6 expression. According to the receiver operating characteristic and calibration curve, the nomogram based on T stage, N stage and GIMAP6 had predictive value for prognosis. According to functional enrichment analysis, GIMAP6 was primarily involved in T-cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction. GIMAP6 was shown to be favorably linked with the infiltration of immune cells and immune-related molecules, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, programmed death-ligand 1, and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains, by single-cell sequencing and TIMER2.0 analysis. The role of GIMAP6 in lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and immunity was experimentally verified.ConclusionThese findings confirmed that GIMAP6 was an effective prognostic molecule that was involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment of LUAD, and may become a predictor for the efficacy of immunotherapy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04980-z.",0
"IntroductionALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas with TP53 mutations have more unstable genomic features, poorer ALK-TKI efficacy and a worse prognosis than ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas with wild-type TP53. Here, we examine the gene variations that co-occur with ALK/RET/ROS1 rearrangements in NSCLC and the corresponding tumor immune microenvironment, as well as their association with prognosis.MethodsA total of 155 patients with ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions were included retrospectively. Tumor genome mutation analysis was performed by next-generation sequencing. PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were assessed by multiplex immunohistochemistry. The correlations among gene covariation, the tumor immune microenvironment, and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed.ResultsAmong the 155 patients, concomitant TP53 mutation appeared most frequently (31%), followed by CDKN2A/B copy number loss (15%). The ALK/RET/ROS1 fusion and TP53 or CDKN2A/B covariation group had more males and patients with stage IV disease (p < 0.001, p = 0.0066). Patients with TP53 or CDKN2A/B co-occurrence had higher tumor mutation burdens and more neoantigens (p < 0.001, p = 0.0032). PD-L1 expression was higher in the tumor areas of the TP53 or CDKN2A/B co-occurring group (p = 0.00038). However, the levels of CD8+, CD8+PD1−, and CD8+PD-L1− TILs were lower in the tumor areas of this group (p = 0.043, p = 0.029, p = 0.025). In the TCGA NSCLC cohorts, the top 2 mutated genes were CDKN2A/B (24%) and TP53 (16%). The TP53 or CDKN2A/B co-occurring group had higher tumor mutation burdens and shorter OS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001).ConclusionsPatients with co-occurring TP53/CDKN2A/B variations and ALK/RET/ROS1 rearrangements are associated with high TMB, more neoantigens, an immunosuppressive microenvironment and a worse prognosis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-04924-7.","PurposeTP53/EGFR co-mutation has been reported to affect the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, its impact on survival is unclear. In this analysis, we explored the prognostic effect of TP53/EGFR co-mutation in LUAD.MethodsClinical data and transcriptome sequencing of LUAD patients with matched genomic data were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for overall survival (OS) analysis. Differential expression genes (DEGs) were recognized by R software and bioconductor package. Clusterprofiler was used for functional analysis. STRING was used for estimating PPI information and plug-in CytoHubba to screen hub modules in Cytoscape. The association between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and survival was also analyzed.ResultsOS was shorter for patients carrying TP53 mutation (MUT) than that of wild type (WT) (37.7 m vs 52.8 m; p = 0.040, HR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.01–1.89). Dual TP53/EGFR-MUT was associated with inferior OS compared with the dual WT/WT cohort (38.4 m vs 51.9 m; p = 0.023, HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.95–3.52). 316 DEGs between dual TP53/EGFR-MUT and dual WT/WT samples were obtained and functional analysis made known that DEGs were strikingly enriched in regulating the metabolism of important amino acids, cell division, cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix composition. KEGG analysis discovered that DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and extracellular matrix receptor interaction. PPI network suggested that GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY genes were up-regulated in dual mutation samples. OS in the high TMB cohort was significantly better than that in the low TMB in patients with TP53 MUT(43.2 m vs 32.4 m; P = 0.007, HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81), as well as in the combination of TP53 MUT and EGFR WT group (44.4 m vs 31.2 m; P = 0.021, HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 − 0.89).ConclusionsTP53 MUT is a poor prognostic factor in LUAD patients, and the prognosis of TP53/EGFR co-mutation is worse. GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY may be novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for patients with dual TP53/EGFR mutation LUAD.",1
"BackgroundOvarian cancer patients’ resistance to first-line treatment posed a significant challenge, with approximately 70% experiencing recurrence and developing strong resistance to first-line chemotherapies like paclitaxel.ObjectivesWithin the framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM), this study aimed to use artificial intelligence to find drug resistance characteristics at the single cell, and further construct the classification strategy and deep learning prognostic models based on these resistance traits, which can better facilitate and perform 3PM.MethodsThis study employed “Beyondcell,” an algorithm capable of predicting cellular drug responses, to calculate the similarity between the expression patterns of 21,937 cells from ovarian cancer samples and the signatures of 5201 drugs to identify drug-resistance cells. Drug resistance features were used to perform 10 multi-omics clustering on the TCGA training set to identify patient subgroups with differential drug responses. Concurrently, a deep learning prognostic model with KAN architecture which had a flexible activation function to better fit the model was constructed for this training set. The constructed patient subtype classifier and prognostic model were evaluated using three external validation sets from GEO: GSE17260, GSE26712, and GSE51088.ResultsThis study identified that endothelial cells are resistant to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and docetaxel, suggesting their potential as targets for cellular therapy in ovarian cancer patients. Based on drug resistance features, 10 multi-omics clustering identified four patient subtypes with differential responses to four chemotherapy drugs, in which subtype CS2 showed the highest drug sensitivity to all four drugs. The other subtypes also showed enrichment in different biological pathways and immune infiltration, allowing for targeted treatment based on their characteristics. Besides, this study applied the latest KAN architecture in artificial intelligence to replace the MLP structure in the DeepSurv prognostic model, finally demonstrating robust performance on patients’ prognosis prediction.ConclusionsThis study, by classifying patients and constructing prognostic models based on resistance characteristics to first-line drugs, has effectively applied multi-omics data into the realm of 3PM.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-024-00374-4.","Increasing evidence indicates that Calumenin (CALU), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is significantly associated with tumor progression. However, the effect of CALU on patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unknown. By integrating multi-omics data and molecular biology experiments, we found that CALU expression was significantly increased in tumors compared with normal tissues, and the pathological grade and prognosis of patients were correlated with CALU expression. Next, knockdown or ectopic expression of CALU could affect the proliferative and invasive abilities of ccRCC cells. Moreover, immune landscape characterization revealed that CALU expression was positively associated with neutrophils and macrophages, whereas it was negatively associated with natural killer T cells and CD8+ T cells. Single-cell sequencing showed that the localization and binding targets of CALU mainly involved monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Sensitivity analysis of common chemotherapeutic drugs showed that high expression of CALU could sensitize chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol, AMG-706 and Cytarabine, but could lead to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as Embelin, Salubrinal and Tipifarnib. We demonstrated a significant correlation between high CALU expression and poor patient survival. Further, we demonstrated a correlation between CALU expression, tumor microenvironment, and the sensitivity of patients to common chemo- and immuno-therapy drugs. Thus, our results indicate that CALU could be a biomarker and designing personalized treatment approaches for ccRCC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-024-00169-7.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is one of the first-line clinical therapeutic strategies for HCC. Still, the effectiveness of chemotherapy is hampered by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and drug resistance caused by insufficient delivery. Herein, we developed a metal-drug self-delivery nanomedicine (FDAH) to improve the chemo/chemodynamic therapeutic efficacy of HCC. The core of FDAH is an iron-based nanoparticle chelated with two clinical drugs, Doxorubicin (DOX) and Plerixafor (AMD3100). Additionally, the nanomedicine is externally modified with a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell, which can prolong the circulation time of the nanoparticles in the bloodstream after intravenous administration. After entering the bloodstream, the nanomedicine reaches the tumor tissue through the EPR effect and is phagocytosed by the tumor cells via HA/CD44-specific interaction. Iron ion-mediated chemodynamic therapy is mediated by the Fenton reaction to generate ROS, causing an imbalance of redox homeostasis within the tumor cells and enhancing the sensitivity of tumor cells to DOX. In addition, AMD3100 intervenes in the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to influence the infiltration level of immune cells and promote DOX chemotherapy in tumor cells. This work suggests that alleviating immunosuppression via a metal-drug self-delivery system of the CXCR4 inhibitor can effectively improve the DOX chemotherapy and iron ions-mediated chemodynamic therapy.","Phenotypic plasticity, the capacity of cells to transition between distinct phenotypic and lineage states over time, is a genetically and epigenetically encoded trait essential for normal development and adult tissue homeostasis. In cancer, phenotypic plasticity programs can be deployed aberrantly to enable disease progression and acquired therapeutic resistance. Cancer phenotypic plasticity is a current barrier to achieving cures for advanced cancers using available molecularly targeted therapies. This review summarizes the complex and interconnected molecular pathways implicated in phenotypic plasticity, both in the context of normal tissue homeostasis and cancer. Molecular pathways convergent between these contexts are highlighted while pathways enabling plasticity are distinguished from those that specify the phenotype of already plastic cells. Key unresolved questions in the field are discussed along with emerging technologies that may be used to help answer them.",0
"The goal of this project was to demonstrate that subpopulations of cells in tumors can uniquely fluctuate in size in response to environmental conditions created during drug treatment, thereby acting as a dynamic “rheostat” to create a favorable tumor environment for growth. The cancer modeling used for these studies was subpopulations of melanoma cells existing in cultured and tumor systems that differed in aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. However, similar observations were found in other cancer types in addition to melanoma, making them applicable broadly across cancer. The approach was designed to show that either ALDHhigh and ALDHlow subpopulations rapidly epigenetically transition between stem-cell-like high into nonstem-like low production states to create an environment during drug treatment that would enable optimal cellular proliferation and tumor expansion to facilitate drug resistance. The controlled experiments showed proportional changes in each cell population to reach an evolutionarily stable equilibrium mediated by the needed levels of ALDH enzyme activity. Mechanistically, cell population size changes served to functionally move the aldehyde and the resulting reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to those compatible with optimal cellular proliferation with population fluctuations dependent on the levels of drug induced tumor stress. This is the first report documenting fluctuations in the sizes of cell populations in tumors to cooperatively assist in drug resistance development.","PurposeNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% in all cases of lung cancer. In recent years, molecular targeting drugs for NSCLC have been developed rapidly. The epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have changed the paradigm of cancer therapy from empirical cytotoxic chemotherapy to molecular-targeted cancer therapy. Currently, there are three generations of EGFR-TKIs, all of which have achieved good efficacy in clinical therapy. However, most patients developed drug resistance after 6–13 months EGFR-TKIs treatment. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of EGFR-TKIs resistance mechanisms is of vital importance for clinical management of NSCLC.MethodsRelevant data and information about the topic were obtained by searching PubMed (Medline), Web of Science and Google Scholar using the subject headings, such as “NSCLC”, “EGFR-TKIs resistance”, “EGFR mutations”, “human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/erbB-2)”, “hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)”, “vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)”, “insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)”, “epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)”, “phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)”, “RAS mutation”, “BRAF mutation”, “signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)”, and “tumor microenvironment”, etc.ResultsThe mechanisms for EGFR-TKIs resistance include EGFR mutations, upregulation of HER2, HGF/c-MET, VEGF IGF1, EMT and STAT3 pathways, mutations of PTEN, RAS and BRAF genes, and activation of other by-pass pathways. These mechanisms are interconnected and can be potential targets for the treatment of NSCLC.ConclusionIn this review, we discuss the mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs drug resistance and the clinical strategies to overcome drug resistance from the perspective of EGFR-TKIs combined treatment.",1
"Immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) can induce life-threatening immune-related adverse events, including myocarditis and myositis, which are rare but often concurrent. The molecular pathways and immune subsets underlying these toxicities remain poorly understood. To address this need, we obtained heart and skeletal muscle biopsies for single-cell RNA sequencing in living patients with cancers treated with ICTs admitted to the hospital with myocarditis and/or myositis (overlapping myocarditis plus myositis, n=10; myocarditis-only, n=1) compared to ICT-exposed patients ruled out for toxicity utilized as controls (n=9) within 96 hours of clinical presentation. Analyses of 58,523 cells revealed CD8+ T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype expressing activation/exhaustion markers in both myocarditis and myositis. Furthermore, the analyses identified a population of myeloid cells expressing tissue-resident signatures and FcγRIIIa (CD16a), which is known to bind IgG and regulate complement activation. Immunohistochemistry of affected cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues revealed protein expression of pan-IgG and complement product C4d that were associated with the presence of high-titer serum autoantibodies against muscle antigens in a subset of patients. We further identified a population of inflammatory IL-1B+TNF+ myeloid cells specifically enriched in myocarditis and associated with greater toxicity severity and poorer clinical outcomes. These results are the first to recognize these myeloid subsets in human immune-related myocarditis and myositis tissues and nominate new targets for investigation into rational treatments to overcome these high-mortality toxicities.","IntroductionIncreasing evidence indicates an important role of microbiota in cancer development and progression, while little is known about the correlation between microbiota and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Thus, we performed this study to profile the intratumoral microbiota possibly associated with RCC.Materials and methodsPaired RCC and adjacent normal tissue samples were collected from 24 patients with RCC. V3-V4 variable region of microbial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing reads were processed using QIIME. Differentially abundant bacterial taxa between groups were identified by LEfSe, and their potential functions were inferred by PICRUSt.ResultsDecreased species diversity was presented in RCC tissues (Simpson index, P = 0.0340), and the composition of the bacterial community in RCC tissues was significantly distinct from that in normal tissues (unweighted UniFrac distance, P = 0.026; weighted UniFrac distance, P = 0.017). Compared with normal tissues, 25 taxa increased and 47 reduced taxa were identified in RCC tissues. Among these taxa, the class Chloroplast (AUC = 0.91, P < 0.0001) and the order Streptophyta (AUC = 0.89, P < 0.0001) showed high indication accuracy to discriminate RCC tissues from normal tissues. Furthermore, nine altered pathways were identified in RCC tissues to reveal the potential microbial function.ConclusionsOur results have uncovered the presence of distinct microbiota in RCC and adjacent normal tissues and provided a better understanding of the possible role of the intratumoral microbiota in RCC. Further studies are required to confirm our results and determine the real correlation between microbiota and RCC.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03462-w) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
"Aim: Wilms’ tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP), plays a part in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, it is not yet known how WTAP affects cancer progression by influencing leukocyte rich repeat containing proteins (NLR) – family members 3 (NLRP3) – related inflammasomes.Materials & methods: We first validated the expression of WTAP in CRC at the tissue and cellular levels. Subsequently, by transfecting si-NC and si-WTAP into cells, we verified functions of WTAP in proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of CRC cells. Finally, we analyzed the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of NLRP3 by WTAP using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR technology, confirming that WTAP mediated the repression of NLRP3 inflammasome and the malignant progression of tumor cells.Results: WTAP was substantially upregulated in CRC tissues and cells. WTAP reinforced the migration, proliferation and invasion ability of CRC cells, and repressed apoptosis. Mechanistically, WTAP mediated the m6A modification of NLRP3, which suppressed the expression of NLRP3 and dampened the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis activation as well as pyroptosis, thereby facilitating the malignant progression of CRC.Conclusion: WTAP mediates m6A modification to modulate the repression of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis in pyroptosis, reinforcing the malignant progression of CRC.","Blockade of the TGFβ signaling pathway has emerged from preclinical studies as a potential treatment to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and several other types of cancer.

As the field continues to advance, pathology laboratories will play increasingly essential roles in the complicated multi-step process of CAR T-cell therapy. These include detection of targetable tumor antigens by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry at the time of disease diagnosis and the isolation and infusion of CAR T cells. Additional roles include: i) detecting antigen loss or heterogeneity that renders resistance to CAR T cells as well as identifying alternative targetable antigens on tumor cells, ii) monitoring the phenotype, persistence, and tumor infiltration properties of CAR T cells and the tumor microenvironment for factors that predict CAR T-cell therapy success, and iii) evaluating side effects and biomarkers of CAR T-cell cytotoxicity such as cytokine release syndrome. This review highlights existing technologies that are applicable to monitoring CAR T-cell persistence, target antigen identification, and loss. Also discussed are emerging technologies that address new challenges such as how to put a brake on CAR T cells.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a survival rate of 12%, and multiple clinical trials testing anti-PD-1 therapies against PDAC have failed, suggesting a need for a novel therapeutic strategy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of milbemycin oxime (MBO), an antiparasitic compound, as an immunomodulatory agent in PDAC. Our results show that MBO inhibited the growth of multiple PDAC cell lines by inducing apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that the oral administration of 5 mg/kg MBO inhibited PDAC tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic models by 49% and 56%, respectively. Additionally, MBO treatment significantly increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice by 27 days as compared to the control group. Interestingly, tumors from MBO-treated mice had increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Notably, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly reduced the anti-tumor efficacy of MBO in mice. Furthermore, MBO significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, and the combination treatment resulted in a greater proportion of active cytotoxic T cells within the tumor microenvironment. MBO was safe and well tolerated in all our preclinical toxicological studies. Overall, our study provides a new direction for the use of MBO against PDAC and highlights the potential of repurposing MBO for enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.","ObjectiveImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been validated in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, there exists no evidence regarding NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, experiencing EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment failure. We collected clinical information from real world and conducted a time series-based meta-analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations and experienced EGFR-TKIs resistance.MethodsTwenty-two NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations after TKI resistance were included from two hospitals. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literature published until December 31, 2021. Endpoint outcomes included mortality and progression-free survival (PFS) at different times of follow-up.ResultsIn total, 22 patients showed that the median PFS was 5.6 months (range 2.0–9.0 months). According to treatment strategies, the median PFS was 2.4 months (range 2.0–5.3 months) in the ICI monotherapy group and 5.9 months (range 2.8–9.0 months) in the ICI combined Chemotherapy group. Additionally, sixteen studies, including 5 trials, 10 controlled cohorts and 1 real-world study, were assessed, involving a total of ICI-treated NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation after TKI failure. The 6-month survival and PFS rate were 0.82 (95% CI 0.36–0.97) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.34–0.74), respectively. ICI combined chemotherapy showed the best survival outcome among these groups, as demonstrated by the 12-month survival rate and PFS. No new safety signals were identified with the combination therapy. The frequency of treatment-related adverse events was similar to that in previously reported studies of chemotherapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors.ConclusionsThe addition of ICIs plus chemotherapy may significantly improve progression-free survival among patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who EGFR-TKIs resistance.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04176-x.",1
"PurposeThis study was conducted to investigate impacts of potential anticancer (associated with apoptosis and caspase pathways) of two newly synthesized derivatives of pillararene, named as d-Q-P5 and p-Q-P5, on Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) cells.Materials and methodsThe MTT method was used to determine the IC50 doses of the derivatives on HNSCC cells, and the changes in gene expression were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The apoptosis change was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis.ResultsThe results showed that the d-Q-P5 and p-Q-P5 effectively inhibited the proliferation of the cells by upregulating proapoptotic genes (Bax, Bad, p53, Bak, and Apaf-1) and genes involved in the caspase pathway (Casp2, Casp3, and Casp9), while downregulating the antiapoptotic gene (Bcl-2).ConclusionsThis study is the first to demonstrate the potential anticancer effects of these two agents on HNSCC cells by positively regulating apoptosis gene expression.","Background and aimFKBP1A, a gene encoding the FK506-binding protein 1A, has emerged as a significant player in cancer progression and prognosis. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer, focusing on its differential expression patterns, prognostic implications, genetic alterations, and associations with the tumor microenvironment.Methods and resultsUsing large-scale datasets, including GTEx, TCGA, HPA, and cBioPortal, we analyzed FKBP1A expression across normal tissues and various cancer types. Our findings revealed that FKBP1A exhibited aberrant upregulation in most human cancers, making it a potential biomarker for malignancy. Moreover, FKBP1A expression correlated with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, disease-free interval, and progression-free interval in several cancers, indicating its prognostic significance. Genetic alteration analysis showed that FKBP1A gene amplification was prevalent, particularly in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, FKBP1A expression was associated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, highlighting its potential involvement in tumor-immune response. Notably, FKBP1A expression positively correlated with stromal and immune cell scores, suggesting its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, according to the functional enrichment analysis, experimental validation in lung adenocarcinoma confirmed the role of FKBP1A through the regulation of EGFR signaling by apoptosis, which is consistent with drug sensitivity analysis to some extent.ConclusionIn conclusion, FKBP1A exhibits differential expression in cancer, serves as a prognostic indicator, undergoes genetic alterations, and influences the tumor-immune microenvironment. These findings shed light on the multifaceted role of FKBP1A in cancer development and progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and guidance of clinical drugs selection, and provide valuable insights into patient prognosis for interventions based on pharmaceuticals.Graphical Abstract Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05362-1.",1
"BackgroundMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, and 30% of patients with thymoma often have myasthenia gravis. Patients with thymoma-associated MG (TAMG) have many different clinical presentations compared to non-MG thymoma (NMG), yet their gene expression differences remain unclear.ObjectiveIn this study, we analyzed the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and analyzed their regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) in TAMG, which will further clarify the possible pathogenesis of TAMG.MethodsDEGs were calculated using the RNA-sequencing data of TAMG and NMG downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. R software was then used to analyze the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of DEGs, while STRING was applied to build the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Cytoscape to identify and visualize the hub genes. Immune infiltration significances of hub genes were also explored by using the TIMER database and TCGA database. Upstream microRNAs (miRNAs) of the hub genes were predicted by online software.ResultsWe comparatively analyzed the gene expression differences between TAMG and NMG groups. A total of 977 DEGs were identified between the two groups (|log fold change (FC)| >2, adjusted P value <0.050), with 555 down-regulated genes and 422 up-regulated genes. Five top hub genes (CTNNB1, EGFR, SOX2, ERBB2, and EGF) were recognized in the PPI network. Analysis based on the TIMER and TCGA databases suggested that 5 hub genes were correlated with multiple immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoint-related markers, such as PDCD1, CTLA-4, and CD274, in TAMG patients. Lastly, 5 miRNAs were identified to have the potential function of regulating the hub gene expression.ConclusionOur study identified 5 hub genes (CTNNB1, EGFR, SOX2, ERBB2, and EGF) and their 5 regulatory miRNAs in TAMG, and the hub genes were correlated with multiple immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoint-related markers. Our findings could help partially clarify the pathophysiology of TAMG, which could be new potential targets for subsequent clinical immunotherapy.","ObjectiveFolate receptor alpha (FRα) is overexpressed on >90% of high-grade epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC). Targeting FRα with antibody-drug conjugates has proven utility in the platinum-resistant setting. It is also a potential therapeutic target for immuno-oncologic agents, such as peptide vaccines that work primarily via adaptive and humoral immunity. We tested the hypothesis that FRα peptide immunization could improve outcomes in patients with EOC following response to platinum-based therapy.MethodsWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TPIV200 (a multi-epitope FRα peptide vaccine admixed with GM-CSF) versus GM-CSF alone in 120 women who did not have disease progression after at least 4 cycles of first-line platinum-based therapy. Patients were vaccinated intradermally once every 4 weeks up to 6 times, followed by a boosting period of 6 vaccinations at 12-week intervals. Primary endpoints included safety, tolerability, and progression free survival (PFS).ResultsAt study termination with a median follow-up of 15.2 months (range 1.2 – 28.4 months), 68 of 119 intention-to-treat patients had disease progression (55% in TPIV200 + GM-CSF arm and 59% in GM-CSF alone arm). The median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI 8.3 – 16.6 months) with no significant difference between the treatment groups (10.9 months with TPIV200 + GM-CSF versus 11.1 months with GM-CSF, HR, 0.85; upper 90% CI 1.17]. No patient experienced a ≥ grade 3 drug-related adverse event.ConclusionTPIV200 was well tolerated but was not associated with improved PFS. Additional studies are required to uncover potential synergies using multiepitope vaccines targeting FRα.",0
"PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibition therapy (ICIT) is an emerging field in oncology especially opening new horizons to chemotherapy refractory patients. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and undesired response patterns such as progression after the initial good response in a subset of patients pose a major challenge and drawback to ICIT. This paper provides deep insight into ICIT related bottlenecks and corresponding effective management and combat strategies for very complex complications.MethodsThe relevant literatures from PubMed have been reviewed. Based on obtained information, rigorous and exhaustive analyses have been made to present novel methods and strategies against ICIT drawbacks and bottlenecks.ResultsThe results show that baseline biomarker tests are very crucial to identify suitable candidates for ICIT and frequent assessments throughout ICIT help to recognize possible irAEs at early stages. Equally important are the necessity for mathematical definitions for the ICIT success rate and optimum duration, and the development of combat mechanisms against loss of sensitivity within the tumor microenvironment (TME).ConclusionRigorous management approaches are presented for mostly observed irAEs. Furthermore, for the first time in the literature, a non-linear mathematical model is invented to measure the ICIT success rate and to decide about the optimum ICIT duration. Finally, a strategy against tumor plasticity is introduced.","ABSTRACT“Inadequate understanding of chirality has potentially disastrous consequences. “Genius on the left, madman on the right” is not an exaggerated verse in the field of chiral research, but a realistic warning…”",0
"ABSTRACTLymphoma, a blood tumor, has become the ninth most common cancer in the world in 2020. Targeted inhibition is one of the important treatments for lymphoma. At present, there are many kinds of targeted drugs for the treatment of lymphoma. Studies have shown that Histone deacetylase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase all play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors and become important and promising inhibitory targets. This article mainly expounds the important role of these target protein in tumors, and introduces the mechanism of action, structure–activity relationship and clinical research of listed small molecule inhibitors of these targets, hoping to provide new ideas for the treatment of lymphoma.","AbstractInhibition of the proteolytic processing of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is an attractive approach for the drug discovery of novel anticancer therapeutics which prevent tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we utilized an improved and expanded version of positional scanning of substrate combinatorial libraries (PS‐SCL) technique called HyCoSuL to optimize peptidomimetic inhibitors of the HGF/MSP activating serine proteases, HGFA, matriptase, and hepsin. These inhibitors have an electrophilic ketone serine trapping warhead and thus form a reversible covalent bond to the protease. We demonstrate that by varying the P2, P3, and P4 positions of the inhibitor with unnatural amino acids based on the protease substrate preferences learned from HyCoSuL, we can predictably modify the potency and selectivity of the inhibitor. We identified the tetrapeptide JH‐1144  as a single digit nM inhibitor of HGFA, matriptase and hepsin with excellent selectivity over Factor Xa and thrombin. These unnatural peptides have increased metabolic stability relative to natural peptides of similar structure. The tripeptide inhibitor PK‐1‐89  has excellent pharmacokinetics in mice with good compound exposure out to 24 h. In addition, we obtained an X‐ray structure of the inhibitor MM1132  bound to matriptase revealing an interesting binding conformation useful for future inhibitor design.",1
"Selective RNA delivery is required for the broad implementation of RNA clinical applications, including prophylactic and therapeutic vaccinations, immunotherapies for cancer, and genome editing. Current polyanion delivery relies heavily on cationic amines, while cationic guanidinium systems have received limited attention due in part to their strong polyanion association, which impedes intracellular polyanion release. Here, we disclose a general solution to this problem in which cationic guanidinium groups are used to form stable RNA complexes upon formulation but at physiological pH undergo a novel charge-neutralization process, resulting in RNA release. This new delivery system consists of guanidinylated serinol moieties incorporated into a charge-altering releasable transporter (GSer-CARTs). Significantly, systematic variations in structure and formulation resulted in GSer-CARTs that exhibit highly selective mRNA delivery to the lung (∼97%) and spleen (∼98%) without targeting ligands. Illustrative of their breadth and translational potential, GSer-CARTs deliver circRNA, providing the basis for a cancer vaccination strategy, which in a murine model resulted in antigen-specific immune responses and effective suppression of established tumors.","Background:The COVID-19 vaccine was initially offered to frontline health care workers (HCWs), due to high risk of contracting COVID-19 through occupational exposure to patients. Low HCW vaccine uptake can impact overall community level vaccine uptake. This study used the diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory to understand factors related to COVID-19 vaccine uptake in HCWs.Methods:We surveyed Pennsylvanian HCWs (excluding Philadelphia) from August 2022 - February 2023. Survey questions inquired about demographics, COVID-19 vaccination status, reasons for receiving/declining the COVID-19 vaccine, and sources of information about the vaccine.Results:Participants (n=3490) were 85% female, 89% White, and 93% (n=3255) reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. HCWs were categorized into adopter categories of the DOI theory: innovators (56%), early adopters (9%), early majority (11%), late majority (7%), and laggards (17%). The major reason that prompted participants to get the vaccine were to protect them against COVID-19 infection (78%), while the major reason for declining the vaccine was due to concern about possible side effects from the vaccine (78%).Conclusion:Our findings suggest that increasing awareness, education, and trust in government and health officials regarding the COVID-19 vaccine may further promote and increase vaccine uptake.",0
"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) (∼50–150 nm) that have emerged as promising vehicles for therapeutic applications and drug delivery. These membrane-bound particles, released by all actively dividing cells, have the ability to transfer effector molecules, including proteins, RNA, and even DNA, from donor cells to recipient cells, thereby modulating cellular responses. RNA-based therapeutics, including microRNAs, messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, hold great potential in controlling gene expression and treating a spectrum of medical conditions. RNAs encapsulated in EVs are protected from extracellular degradation, making them attractive for therapeutic applications. Understanding the intricate biology of cargo loading and transfer within EVs is pivotal to unlocking their therapeutic potential. This review discusses the biogenesis and classification of EVs, methods for loading RNA into EVs, their advantages as drug carriers over synthetic-lipid-based systems, and the potential applications in treating neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Notably, EVs show promise in delivering RNA cargo across the blood-brain barrier and targeting tumor cells, offering a safe and effective approach to RNA-based therapy in these contexts.","AbstractExosomes are extracellular vesicles that are released from most cell types encapsulating specific molecular cargo. Exosomes serve as mediators of cell‐to‐cell and tissue‐to‐tissue communications under normal and pathological conditions. It has been shown that exosomes carrying muscle‐specific miRNAs, myomiRs, are secreted from skeletal muscle cells in vitro and are elevated in the blood of muscle disease patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the secretion of exosomes encapsulating the four myomiRs from skeletal muscle tissues and to assess their role in inter‐tissue communication between neighboring skeletal muscles in vivo. We demonstrate, for the first time, that isolated, intact skeletal muscle tissues secrete exosomes encapsulating the four myomiRs, miR‐1, miR‐133a, miR‐133b, and miR‐206. Notably, we show that the sorting of the four myomiRs within exosomes varies between skeletal muscles of different muscle fiber‐type composition. miR‐133a and miR‐133b downregulation in TA muscles caused a reduction of their levels in neighboring skeletal muscles and in serum exosomes. In conclusion, our results reveal that skeletal muscle‐derived exosomes encapsulate the four myomiRs, some of which enter the blood, while a portion is used for the local communication between proximal muscle tissues. These findings provide important evidence regarding novel pathways implicated in skeletal muscle function.",1
"Changes in gut flora are associated with liver fibrosis. The interactions of host with intestinal flora are still unknown, with little research investigating such interactions with comprehensive multi-omics data. The present work analyzed and integrated large-scale multi-omics transcriptomics, microbiome, metabolome, and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from Kaempferol-treated and untreated control groups by advanced bioinformatics methods. This study concludes that kaempferol dose-dependently improved serum markers (like AST, ALT, TBil, Alb, and PT) and suppressed fibrosis markers (including HA, PC III, LN, α-SMA, and Collagen I), while kaempferol also increased body weight. Mechanistically, kaempferol improved the metabolic levels of intestinal flora dysbiosis and associated lipids. This was achieved by increasing the abundance of g__Robinsoniella, g__Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003, g__Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002, and 5-Methylcytidine, all-trans-5,6- Epoxyretinoic acid, LPI (18:0), LPI (20:4), etc. to achieve this. Kaemferol exerts anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects by down-regulating the Th17/IL-17 signaling pathway in PDGF-induced LX2 cells. In addition, kaempferol administration remarkably elevated CD4 + T and CD8 + T cellular proportions, thereby activating immune cells for protecting the body and controlling inflammatory conditions. The combined interaction of multiple data may explain how Kaempferol modulates the intestinal flora thereby remodeling the hepatocyte population and alleviating liver fibrosis.Graphical Abstract","AimWe aimed to evaluate the effect of concomitant proton pump inhibitors (PPI) use with nivolumab on survival outcomes in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in second-line setting.MethodsThe study was designed as a multicenter and retrospective involving patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving second-line nivolumab therapy. One hundred and nine patients with mRCC were divided into two groups based on whether they use PPI concomitantly with nivolumab: concomitant PPI users and non-users. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between the groups with and without concurrent PPIs.ResultsOf 109 patients in our study, 59 were not using PPI concomitantly with nivolumab and 50 were using PPI concomitantly. The median PFS was 6.37 (5.2–7.5) months in the concomitant PPI group and 9.7 (4.5–15) months in the non-users (p = 0.03). The median OS was 14.6 (7.1–22.1) months in patients on PPI concurrently with nivolumab and 29.9 (17.1–42.7) months in the non-users (p = 0.01). Accordingly, PPI use for PFS (Non-use vs. Use = HR: 0.44, 95%Cl 0.28–0.96, p = 0.014) and PPI use for OS (Non-use vs. Use = HR: 0.68, 95%Cl 0.22–0.88, p = 0.01) were found to be as independent risk factors.ConclusionsConcomitant use of PPIs is associated with worse survival outcomes in patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab. Clinicians should carefully consider the concomitant use of PPIs in such patients.",0
"AbstractGlioblastoma (GBM) remains to be one of the deadliest cancers with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. While immunotherapies have revolutionized the field for other cancers, GBM remains resistant to these types of interventions partly due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by accumulation of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify molecular targets for improve anti-tumorigenic T cell response. Previous studies in our laboratory identified dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an exopeptidase and a membrane-bound signaling receptor, as a potential marker of immunosuppression in GBM. While DPP-4 is well-drugged due to its role in insulin metabolism, the function of DPP-4 in immune regulation and cancer remains poorly defined. I observed that DPP-4 is highly expressed by CD8+ T cells GBM patients and preclinical models. Furthermore, DPP-4 levels increased with the exhaustion or memory differentiation of effector T cell. Pharmaceutical inhibition of DPP-4 enriched expression of genes related to lymphocyte activation and mitochondrial metabolism. These transcriptional changes were accompanied by enhanced T cell proliferation, cytotoxic function, and effector mediator production under exhaustion conditions. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 promotes anti-tumorigenic function of CD8+ T-cell by preventing exhaustion and support future translational efforts to repurpose DPP-4 inhibitors as immunotherapy agents in GBM, given their favorable safety profiles.","This review discusses the eco-friendly and cost-effective biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in viable microorganisms, focusing on microbes-mediated AuNP biosynthesis. This process suits agricultural, environmental, and biomedical applications, offering renewable, eco-friendly, non-toxic, sustainable, and time-efficient methods. Microorganisms are increasingly used in green technology, nanotechnology, and RNAi technology, but several microorganisms have not been fully identified and characterized. Bio-nanotechnology offers eco-friendly and sustainable solutions for nanomedicine, with microbe-mediated nanoparticle biosynthesis producing AuNPs with anti-oxidation activity, stability, and biocompatibility. Ultrasmall AuNPs offer rapid distribution, renal clearance, and enhanced permeability in biomedical applications. The review explores nano-size dependent biosynthesis of AuNPs by bacteria, fungi, and viruses revealing their non-toxic, non-genotoxic, and non-oxidative properties on human cells. AuNPs with varying sizes and shapes, from nitrate reductase enzymes, have shown potential as a promising nano-catalyst. The synthesized AuNPs, with negative charge capping molecules, have demonstrated antibacterial activity against drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains, and were non-toxic to Vero cell lines, indicating potential antibiotic resistance treatments. A green chemical method for the biosynthesis of AuNPs using reducing chloroauric acid and Rhizopus oryzae protein extract has been described, demonstrating excellent stability and strong catalytic activity. AuNPs are eco-friendly, non-toxic, and time-efficient, making them ideal for biomedical applications due to their antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antibacterial properties. In addition to the biomedical application, the review also highlights the role of microbially synthesized AuNPs in sustainable management of plant diseases, and environmental bioremediation.",0
"P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) is an adenosine-activated G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a central role in platelet function, hemostasis, and thrombosis. P2Y12R activation can promote platelet aggregation and adhesion to cancer cells, promote tumor angiogenesis, and affect the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumor drug resistance, which is conducive to the progression of cancers. Meanwhile, P2Y12R inhibitors can inhibit this effect, suggesting that P2Y12R may be a potential therapeutic target for cancer. P2Y12R is involved in cancer development and metastasis, while P2Y12R inhibitors are effective in inhibiting cancer. However, a new study suggests that long-term use of P2Y12R inhibitors may increase the risk of cancer and the mechanism remains to be explored. In this paper, we reviewed the structural and functional characteristics of P2Y12R and its role in cancer. We explored the role of P2Y12R inhibitors in different tumors and the latest advances by summarizing the basic and clinical studies on the effects of P2Y12R inhibitors on tumors.","Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a main driver of immunosuppression in tumors. Understanding the mechanisms that determine the development and immunosuppressive function of these cells could provide new therapeutic targets to improve antitumor immunity. Here, using preclinical murine models, we discovered that exportin 1 (XPO1) expression is upregulated in tumor MDSCs and that this upregulation is induced by IL-6-induced STAT3 activation during MDSC differentiation. XPO1 blockade transforms MDSCs into T-cell-activating neutrophil-like cells, enhancing the antitumor immune response and restraining tumor growth. Mechanistically, XPO1 inhibition leads to the nuclear entrapment of ERK1/2, resulting in the prevention of ERK1/2 phosphorylation following the IL-6-mediated activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Similarly, XPO1 blockade in human MDSCs induces the formation of neutrophil-like cells with immunostimulatory functions. Therefore, our findings revealed a critical role for XPO1 in MDSC differentiation and suppressive functions; exploiting these new discoveries revealed new targets for reprogramming immunosuppressive MDSCs to improve cancer therapeutic responses.",1
"Metabolic adaptation serves as a significant driving force for cancer growth and poses a substantial obstacle for cancer therapies. Herein, we unraveled the role of m6A-mediated serine synthesis pathway (SSP) regulation in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrated that treatment of highly specific m6A inhibitor (STM2457) effectively inhibited HCC cell line growth and suppressed spontaneous HCC formation in mice driven by liver-specific Tp53 knockout and Myc overexpression. Using GLORI-seq, we delineated a single-base-resolution m6A landscape in human HCC cell lines. Interestingly, we identified three core enzymes in the SSP (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) as novel targets of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In these SSP genes, m6A modification recruited m6A reader IGF2BP3 to stabilize their mRNA transcripts, thereby enhancing their mRNA and protein expression in HCC cells. Most importantly, our GLORI-seq data revealed that sorafenib-resistant HCC cells elevated m6A modification in SSP genes to promote protein expression and antioxidant production. STM2457 treatment attenuated the serine synthesis pathway, induced oxidative stress, and sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib treatments. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting m6A could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","PurposeEarly biochemical recurrence (eBCR) indicated a high risk for potential recurrence and metastasis in prostate cancer. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification played an important role in prostate cancer progression. This study aimed to develop a m6A lncRNA signature to accurately predict eBCR in prostate cancer.MethodsPearson correlation analysis was first conducted to explore m6A lncRNAs and univariate Cox regression analysis was further performed to identify m6A lncRNAs of prognostic roles for predicting eBCR in prostate cancer. The m6A lncRNA signature was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis (LASSO) in training cohort and further validated in test cohort. Furthermore, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were utilized to explore potential effective drugs for high-risk group in this study.ResultsFive hundred and thirty-eighth m6A lncRNAs were searched out through Pearson correlation analysis and 25 out of 538 m6A lncRNAs were identified to pose prediction roles for eBCR in prostate cancers. An m6A lncRNA signature including 5 lncRNAs was successfully built in training cohort. The high-risk group derived from m6A lncRNA signature could efficiently predict eBCR occurrence in both training (p < 0.001) and test cohort (p = 0.002). ROC analysis also confirmed that lncRNA signature in this study posed more accurate prediction roles for eBCR occurrence when compared with PSA, TNM stages and Gleason scores. Drug sensitivity analysis further discovered that various drugs could be potentially utilized to treat high-risk samples in this study. ConclusionsThe m6A lncRNA signature in this study could be utilized to efficiently predict eBCR occurrence, various clinical characteristic and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04040-y.",1

Access rate, demographics, diagnostic-therapeutic temporal intervals, and first-line progression-free survival (PFS) and OS among metastatic patients were assessed.ResultsCompared to 2019 (n = 690), an initial global reduction in new CRC cases in 2020 (n = 564, –18.3%) was observed, followed by a progressive increase in new CRC diagnoses in 2021 (n = 748, + 8.4%) and 2022 (n = 756, + 9.6%); a higher rate of TNM stage IV tumors was diagnosed in 2020 (35.4%) and 2021 (31.0%) compared to 2019 (29.6%), with normalization in 2022 (26.4%) (P < .001). Not clinically relevant differences between histological diagnosis and first oncological examination, cytohistological diagnosis and systemic treatment start, first oncological appointment and systemic treatment start, treatment start and first radiological assessment between 2020 and 2021-2022 years were found. After propensity score matching according to the year of diagnosis, median OS was significantly worse in 2020, 2021, and 2022 compared to 2019 (27.6 vs 24.8 vs not reached vs 38.9 months, respectively) (P < .001). Concordantly, the median PFS was significantly worse with each passing year: 13.0 vs 11.1 vs 9.2 vs 7.2 months in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively (P = .00027).ConclusionsA progressive normalization in the rate of new CRC diagnosis as well as TNM stages at diagnosis, in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2020 and 2019, was found. The increase in new CRC cases might have affected some diagnostic-therapeutic time intervals in 2021-2022 years compared to 2020. Significantly, compared to the pre-pandemic phase, pandemic years were independently associated with worse PFS and OS outcomes in patients affected by metastatic disease.",1
"AbstractThe respiratory tract with its vast surface area and very thin air-blood tissue barrier presents an extremely large interface for potential interaction with xenobiotics such as inhaled pathogens or medicaments. To protect its large and vulnerable surface, the lung is populated with several different types of immune cells. Pulmonary epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells are key players in shaping the innate and adaptive immune response. Due to their localization, they represent a frontline of cell populations that are among the first to come in contact with inhaled xenobiotics. Furthermore, depending on the lung compartment they populate, these cells show a large variety in morphology, phenotype, and function. These unique characteristics make those cell populations ideal targets for specific immunomodulators that are designed for inhalation. Depending on cell population or lung compartment targeting, a specific immune response may be triggered or modulated. The purpose of a potent carrier for pulmonary immunomodulation is, first, to efficiently target a specific immunocompetent cell and, second, to affect its role in generating an immune response. Immunomodulation may occur at different levels of immune cell-antigen interaction, that is antigen uptake, trafficking, processing and presentation. Inhalation of nanosized carriers for drugs or vaccines shows great potential for both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches in order to modulate immune responses locally or systemically, due to the specific deposition and targeting properties of nanoparticles. Immune responses triggered by nanosized particles may be either immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive and depending on the specific purpose, stimulation or suppression may either be desired or unwanted. Meticulous analysis of immunomodulatory potential, pharmacologic and toxicologic testing of inhalable nanocarriers is required in order to find novel and optimal approaches for prophylaxis and therapy of pulmonary diseases. The design and characterization of such nanoparticles requires well-coordinated interdisciplinary research among engineers, biologists and clinicians.","Aim: To develop and characterize doxorubicin-loaded sodium selenite nanoparticles (SSNP-DOX) and their surface attachment with cetuximab (mAb-SSNP-DOX).Methods: SSNP-DOX was formulated by gelation and then conjugated with cetuximab to form mAb-SSNP-DOX. Characterization included DLS, SEM, TEM, DSC, Raman spectroscopy and XRD. In vitro, the kinetics of doxorubicin release and cytotoxicity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells were investigated.Results: The zeta potential for SSNP-DOX and mAb-SSNP-DOX was -14.4 ± 10.1 mV and -27.5 ± 7.28 mV, with particle sizes of 181.3 nm and 227.5 nm, respectively. The formulation intensity was 89.7% for SSNP-DOX and 100% for mAb-SSNP-DOX, with PDI values of 0.419 and 0.251, respectively. SEM and TEM showed that mAb-SSNP-DOX was smooth and spherical. The DSC analysis revealed exothermic peaks at 102.44°C for SSNP-DOX and 144.21°C for mAb-SSNP-DOX, along with endothermic peaks at 269.19°C and 241.6°C, respectively. Raman spectroscopy showed a higher intensity for mAb-SSNP-DOX. The XRD study showed different peaks for each formulation. Both followed zero order kinetics for doxorubicin release. Cytotoxicity studies showed significant effects and high apoptosis in MCF-7 cells for both formulations.Conclusion: The mAb-SSNP-DOX showed promising properties, more effective doxorubicin release and higher cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells compared with SSNP-DOX.",1
"Hepatic sarcomatoid carcinoma (HSC) is characterized by its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. As of now, no universally endorsed standard therapeutic approaches for HSC have been established. Herein, we describe the case of a 60-year-old individual diagnosed with HSC, subsequently presenting with multiple metastases postoperatively. Owing to the pronounced expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), the individual was subjected to monotherapy utilizing sintilimab for a duration spanning 12 months. Following this regimen, a synergistic treatment approach comprising both anlotinib and sintilimab was instituted, culminating in an ensuing 11 months of efficacious therapeutic response. Throughout the course of treatment, the patient's quality of life remained satisfactory. This particular therapeutic strategy not merely reinforces the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in the realm of HSC management, but more pivotally, suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) might counteract resistance to PD-1 antagonists, thus offering a potentially augmented treatment paradigm for HSC.","The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to oncological care has transformed the management of various malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), offering improved outcomes. The first-line treatment of recurrent and malignant HNSCC for many years was combined platinum, 5-fluorouracil, and cetuximab. Recently, the ICI pembrolizumab was approved as a first-line treatment, with or without chemotherapy, based on tumor and immune cell percentage of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Multiple head and neck (HN) cancer trials have subsequently explored immunotherapies in combination with surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation. Immunotherapy regimens may be personalized by tumor biomarker, including PD-L1 content, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability. However, further clinical trials are needed to refine biomarker-driven protocols and standardize pathological methods to guide combined regimen timing, sequencing, and deescalation. Gaps remain for protocols using immunotherapy to reverse oral premalignant lesions, particularly high-risk leukoplakias. A phase II nonrandomized controlled trial, using the ICI nivolumab, showed a 2-y cancer-free survival of 73%, although larger trials are needed. Guidelines are also needed to standardize the role of dental evaluation and care before, during, and after immunotherapy, specifically in regard to oral immune-related adverse events and their impact on cancer recurrence. Standardized diagnostic and oral care coordination strategies to close these gaps are needed to ensure continued success of HN cancer immunotherapy.",0
"TCF1high progenitor CD8+ T cells mediate the efficacy of immunotherapy, however the mechanisms that govern their generation and maintenance are poorly understood. Here, we show that targeting glycolysis through deletion of pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2) results in elevated pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity, leading to enrichment of a TCF1high progenitor exhausted-like phenotype and increased responsiveness to PD-1 blockade in vivo. PKM2KO CD8+ T cells showed reduced glycolytic flux, accumulation of glycolytic intermediates and PPP metabolites, and increased PPP cycling as determined by 1,2 13C glucose carbon tracing. Small molecule agonism of the PPP without acute glycolytic impairment skewed CD8+ T cells towards a TCF1high population, generated a unique transcriptional landscape, and adoptive transfer of agonist-treated CD8+ T cells enhanced tumor control in mice in combination with PD-1 blockade, and promoted tumor killing in patient-derived tumor organoids. Our study demonstrates a new metabolic reprogramming that contributes to a progenitor-like T cell state promoting immunotherapy efficacy.","PurposeImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are frequently associated with adverse events, often affecting the gastrointestinal tract. We conducted this study to determine the characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients with pre-existing microscopic colitis (MC) who underwent ICI treatment.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we identified 10 patients with pre-existing MC who received ICIs at our center 01/2010–06/2020. Clinical characteristics and disease outcomes were recorded.ResultsOf 124 screened patients with MC before ICI exposure, 10 had sufficient data to be included in the study. Melanoma (40%) and lung cancer (30%) were the most prevalent cancer types, with 70% of stage IV cancer. Patients received either anti-programmed death 1 regimen (8, 80%) or anti-programmed death ligand 1 agent (2, 20%). Six patients (60%) had collagenous colitis, and 4 (40%) had lymphocytic colitis. The median time from MC diagnosis to ICI initiation was 4 years, with 1 patient on budesonide within 2 months of ICI initiation. Eight patients (80%) developed colitis exacerbations after ICI and required selective immunosuppression. One patient received a compassionate-use fecal transplantation. The median time from ICI to colitis exacerbation was 14 days, with 40% and 50% of patients experiencing grade 3 diarrhea and grade 2 colitis, respectively, leading to hospitalization in 3 patients. Six patients received steroids and vedolizumab with no colitis recurrence. Of 8 patients who had colitis exacerbation, 6 resumed ICI therapy afterward; with 5 receiving concomitant vedolizumab for secondary prophylaxis.ConclusionOur findings suggest that ICI exposure increases the risk of exacerbation of underlying colitis necessitating and responding to potent immunosuppression therapy.",0
"Background:Missing data is common in studies using electronic health records (EHR)-derived data. Missingness in EHR data is related to healthcare utilization patterns, resulting in complex and potentially missing not at random missingness mechanisms. Prior research has suggested that machine learning-based multiple imputation methods may outperform traditional methods and may perform well even in settings of missing not at random missingness.Methods:We used plasmode simulations based on a nationwide EHR-derived de-identified database for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma to compare performance of multiple imputation using chained equations, random forests, and denoising autoencoders in terms of bias and precision of hazard ratio estimates under varying proportions of observations with missing values and missingness mechanisms (missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random).Results:Multiple imputation by chained equations and random forest methods had low bias and similar standard errors for parameter estimates under missingness completely at random. Under missingness at random, denoising autoencoders had higher bias than multiple imputation by chained equations and random forests. Contrary to results of prior studies of denoising autoencoders, all methods exhibited substantial bias under missingness not at random, with bias increasing in direct proportion to the amount of missing data.Conclusions:We found no advantage of denoising autoencoders for multiple imputation in the setting of an epidemiologic study conducted using EHR data. Results suggested that denoising autoencoders may overfit the data leading to poor confounder control. Use of more flexible imputation approaches does not mitigate bias induced by missingness not at random and can produce estimates with spurious precision.","Bacteria encode an arsenal of diverse systems that defend against phage infection. A common theme uniting many prevalent anti-phage defense systems is the use of specialized nucleotide signals that function as second messengers to activate downstream effector proteins and inhibit viral propagation. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms controlling nucleotide immune signaling in four major families of anti-phage defense systems: CBASS, Pycsar, Thoeris, and type III CRISPR immunity. Analysis of the individual steps connecting phage detection, nucleotide signal synthesis, and downstream effector function reveals shared core principles of signaling and uncovers system-specific strategies used to augment immune defense. We compare recently discovered mechanisms used by phages to evade nucleotide immune signaling and highlight convergent strategies that shape host-virus interactions. Finally, we explain how the evolutionary connection between bacterial anti-phage defense and eukaryotic antiviral immunity defines fundamental rules that govern nucleotide-based immunity across all kingdoms of life.",0
"AbstractThe aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role of circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection in the surgical assessment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with thrombi.Nine patients diagnosed with renal mass and thrombi were enrolled from June 2018 to January 2019. Blood samples were collected for CTC detection using SE-iFISH assay. CD45, DAPI, programmed death ligand 1, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with the centromere of chromosome 8 (CEP8) were immune-stained for analysis. Patient demographics, clinical features, pathological characteristics, and CTC detection results were extracted for analysis.Seven of 9 patients (77.8%) had 12 detectable CTCs, 5 of which were with CEP8-positive signal ≥5 and the others were CEP8-positive signal = 3. All 3 patients (100%) with IVC invasion had detectable CTCs, whereas CTCs were detected in 4 of 6 patients (66.7%) without IVC invasion. CEP8 analysis revealed that CTCs in IVC invasion patients were all of CEP8-positive signal ≥5 status, whereas only half of the CTCs in patients without IVC invasion were of CEP8-positive signal ≥5 pattern.In conclusion, both CTC subtype and total CTC number may serve as a marker for predicting inferior vena cava invasion in RCC patients.","Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have potential as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in solid tumors. Despite Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of CTC devices in various cancers, the rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs in lung cancer make them technically challenging to isolate and analyze, hindering their clinical integration. Establishing a consensus through comparative analysis of different CTC systems is warranted. This study aimed to evaluate seven different CTC enrichment methods across five technologies using a standardized spike‐in protocol: the CellMag™ (EpCAM‐dependent enrichment), EasySep™ and RosetteSep™ (blood cell depletion), and the Parsortix® PR1 and the new design Parsortix® Prototype (PP) (size‐ and deformability‐based enrichment). The Parsortix® systems were also evaluated for any differences in recovery rates between cell harvest versus in‐cassette staining. Healthy donor blood (5 mL) was spiked with 100 fluorescently labeled EpCAMhigh H1975 cells, processed through each system, and the isolation efficiency was calculated. The CellMag™ had the highest recovery rate (70 ± 14%), followed by Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining, while the EasySep™ had the lowest recovery (18 ± 8%). Additional spike‐in experiments were performed with EpCAMmoderate A549 and EpCAMlow H1299 cells using the CellMag™ and Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining. The recovery rate of CellMag™ significantly reduced to 35 ± 14% with A549 cells and 1 ± 1% with H1299 cells. However, the Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining showed cell phenotype‐independent and consistent recovery rates among all lung cancer cell lines: H1975 (49 ± 2%), A549 (47 ± 10%), and H1299 (52 ± 10%). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining method is capable of isolating heterogeneous single CTCs and cell clusters from patient samples. The Parsortix® PR1 in‐cassette staining, capable of isolating different phenotypes of CTCs as either single cells or cell clusters with consistent recovery rates, is considered optimal for CTC enrichment for lung cancer, albeit needing further optimization and validation.",1
"Patients receiving chemotherapy by intravenous (i.v.) or oral administration of anticancer drugs often experience side effects. In this study, an electro-osmotic flow (EO) pump was used for the direct administration of an anticancer drug with minimum side effects. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DXR) was used as an anticancer drug, and its antitumor effect and toxicity were evaluated in comparison with i.v. administration. Balb/c female mice were subcutaneously transplanted with a breast cancer cell line (4T1/Luc) stably expressing luciferase, and 20 μL of DXR solution (1.0 mg/mL) was administered intratumorally (i.t.) at a slow rate (0.6 µL/min) using an EO pump or rapidly using a syringe. For comparison, 100 μL of DXR solution was injected through the tail vein at the same dose and a 5-times higher dose. A tumor growth inhibitory effect without significant weight loss was observed with direct i.t. administration of DXR using an EO pump. On the other hand, no suppressive tumor growth effect was observed with i.v. administration of DXR at the same dose. Although there was no significant difference in the suppression effect on tumor growth between i.t. administration with EO pump and syringe, the peripheral skin concentration of DXR were decreased after slow administration with EO pump compared with that after rapidly administration with a syringe. These results indicated that direct i.t. administration of DXR with lower dosing using an EO pump at slower administration rate may be useful for exhibiting antitumor effects and suppressing systemic side effects. In addition, the blood concentration and the peripheral skin concentration of DXR after administration at lower rate with EO pump were decreased compared with those after the rapidly administration with a syringe.","Despite significant advancement in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of breast carcinoma, the prognosis remains dismal. Recently, with advances in its understanding, various immune system-based management strategies have been developed. CTLA-4 suppresses lymphocyte reactivity, IL-2 secretion, and IL-2 receptor expression and triggers cell cycle arrest. PD-L1 inhibits the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibits release of cytokines. Hence, we planned to evaluate the immunoexpression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in invasive ductal carcinoma breast and seek correlation between their immunopositivity and the clinicopathological parameters. This was a retrospective study conducted on archival material of 50 cases of breast carcinoma tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological details were recorded. All cases were evaluated for immunohistochemical expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Cytoplasmic expression of CTLA-4 and membranous expression of PD-L1 were considered positive and staining intensity was recorded as mild, moderate, and intense. Data was recorded and analyzed. Immunopositivity for CTLA-4 was seen in 92% of cases of breast carcinoma. CTLA-4 staining intensity showed significant association with TNM staging of breast carcinomas (p = 0.036). Age group of the breast carcinoma cases showed a statistically significant correlation with PD-L1 immunoexpression (p = 0.002). No significant correlation was found between all other clinicopathological characteristics and CTLA-4 or PD-L1 immunostaining. Our study shows that CTLA-4 is a more important immune checkpoint regulator in breast carcinomas in comparison to PD-L1. Thus, anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy might prove to be of immense help in the treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma breast showing overexpression of CTLA-4.",0
"ABSTRACTLung cancer is a leading cause of global cancer mortality, often treated with chemotherapeutic agents. However, conventional approaches such as oral or intravenous administration of drugs yield low bioavailability and adverse effects. Nanotechnology has unlocked new gateways for delivering medicine to their target sites. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) are one of the nano-scaled delivery platforms that have been studied to exploit advantages of liposomes and polymers, enhancing stability, drug loading, biocompatibility and controlled release. Pulmonary administration of drug-loaded LPHNPs enables direct lung deposition, rapid onset of action and heightened efficacy at low doses of drugs. In this manuscript, we will review the potential of LPHNPs in management of lung cancer through pulmonary administration.","Purpose:Young adult cancer survivors experience disruptions in various life domains (for example, relationships, academic/career) during and after treatment. This study examined life disruptions and related supports to update interventions to improve psychological outcomes.Methods:In April–July 2023, young adult survivors (n = 23) were recruited (via clinics, support groups, nonprofit organizations, etc.) to complete semi-structured interviews assessing cancer’s impact across life domains, how they coped with related disruptions, and facilitators to improved psychosocial well-being. We used a dual deductive–inductive approach to develop a codebook and then coded transcripts in Dedoose.Results:This sample was on average 33.7 years old (standard deviation [SD] = 4.4), 78.3% female, 73.9% non-Hispanic White, 47.8% married/cohabitating, 2.4 (SD = 1.0) years post-diagnosis, 1.4 years (SD = 0.9) post-treatment, and largely diagnosed with breast cancer (52.1%) or leukemia/lymphoma (34.7%). The most salient themes related to disruptions included mental health, feelings of isolation during survivorship, and disruptions to career and relationships with family or partners. Participants reported challenges navigating these feelings and disruptions, and difficulty understanding and conveying their needs. Many experienced limited support for navigating cancer-related trauma and life disruptions as a survivor. Participants also reported some positive impacts, like reevaluating their values and goals or feeling resilient, and emphasized the need to identify supports, accept that life had changed because of cancer, and have their needs and continued struggles validated by others during survivorship.Conclusions:Young adults experience ongoing disruptions across multiple life domains, underscoring the need for integrated, longer-term psychosocial supports to help them navigate these disruptions and reevaluate their goals.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that is capturing popular imagination and can revolutionize biomedicine. AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to break through existing barriers in oncology research and practice such as automating workflow processes, personalizing care, and reducing healthcare disparities. Emerging applications of AI/ML in the literature include screening and early detection of cancer, disease diagnosis, response prediction, prognosis, and accelerated drug discovery. Despite this excitement, only few AI/ML models have been properly validated and fewer have become regulated products for routine clinical use. In this review, we highlight the main challenges impeding AI/ML clinical translation. We present different clinical use cases from the domains of radiology, radiation oncology, immunotherapy, and drug discovery in oncology. We dissect the unique challenges and opportunities associated with each of these cases. Finally, we summarize the general requirements for successful AI/ML implementation in the clinic, highlighting specific examples and points of emphasis including the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration of stakeholders, role of domain experts in AI augmentation, transparency of AI/ML models, and the establishment of a comprehensive quality assurance program to mitigate risks of training bias and data drifts, all culminating toward safer and more beneficial AI/ML applications in oncology labs and clinics.","ABSTRACTPoly(amino acid) nanomedicines hold significant promise for cancer therapy. However, their clinical translation has not matched the extensive efforts of scientists or the burgeoning body of research. The therapeutic outcomes with most nanomedicines often fall short of the promising results observed in animal experiments. This review explores the challenges faced in cancer therapy using poly(amino acid) nanomedicines, particularly addressing the controversies surrounding the enhanced permeability and retention effect and the lack of methods for controlled and reproducible mass production of poly(amino acid) nanomedicines. Furthermore, this review examines the opportunities emerging in this field due to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence.",1
"AbstractWith substantial effects on human health, air pollution has become a major global concern. Air pollution has been linked to numerous gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases with increasing mortalities. The gut and respiratory dysbiosis brought about by air pollution has recently received much attention. This review attempts to provide an overview of the types of air pollutants, their sources, their impact on the respiratory and gut dysbiotic patterns and their correlation with five major diseases including pneumonia, asthma, COPD, lung cancer and irritable bowel syndrome. Deeper insights into the links between pollutants, dysbiosis and disease may pave the way for novel diagnostic biomarkers for prognosis and early detection of these diseases, as well as ways to ease the disease burden.","AbstractAsthma exacerbation is a common clinical occurrence. The causal factors are not fully understood yet. Environmental pollution is linked to asthma exacerbation. The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (MNP), an environmental pollutant, in asthma exacerbation. In this study, an airway allergy mouse model was established with ovalbumin as a specific antigen with or without the presence of MNP. The results showed that, in a mouse model, the intensity of airway allergy was significantly increased by exposure to MNP. RNAseq results showed an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated molecules and the Osm expression in airway epithelial cells of mice with airway allergy. Exposure of epithelial cells to MNP in culture induced the expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and ER stress associated molecules. The OSM receptor was expressed by macrophages. OSM could drive macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Inhibition of PERK, one of the key molecules of ER stress, or depletion of OSM receptor in macrophages, could effectively attenuate the MNP/ovalbumin protocol induced airway allergy. To sum up, by promoting ER stress, environmental pollutant MNP can cause airway epithelial cells to produce OSM. The latter induces macrophages to produce TNF-α, which can exacerbate airway allergy.",1
"AbstractObjectiveNon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading attributor to cancer deaths. High HDAC10 and low microRNA (miR)-223-5p levels have been observed in NSCLC. But their roles remain elusive. This study illustrated their roles in NSCLC cell ferroptosis and the mechanism.MethodsHDAC10, miR-223-5p, and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) levels in cells were determined by RT-qPCR. Iron ion content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione (GSH) levels were tested using reagent kits, and levels of SLC7A11 and Acyl-CoA synthesis long chain family (ACSL4) were examined using Western blot. Chromatin immunoprecision was performed to analyze the enrichment of HDAC10 and acetylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9ac) on the miR-223-5p promoter. The targeted binding of miR-223-5p and SLC7A11 was analyzed by dual-luciferase assay. Joint experiments were designed to identify the role of miR-223-5p/SLC7A11 axis in HDAC10-regulated ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.ResultsHDAC10 was highly expressed in NSCLC cells. Silencing HDAC10 significantly reduced GSH and SLC7A11 levels, upregulated iron ion content, ROS levels, and ACSL4 expression, promoting cell ferroptosis. Mechanically, HDAC10 inhibited miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby targeting SLC7A11. The joint experimental results showed that overexpression of SLC7A11 or downregulation of miR-223-5p alleviated the promoting effect of silencing HDAC10 on ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.ConclusionHDAC10 inhibits miR-223-5p expression through H3K9ac deacetylation of the miR-223-5p promoter, thereby promoting SLC7A11 expression and inhibiting ferroptosis in NSCLC cells.","BackgroundLung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens people’s health worldwide. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in regulating LUAD growth and metastasis as well as in therapeutic response. However, currently, there is a lack of integrative analysis of PCD-related signatures of LUAD for accurate prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response.MethodsThe bulk transcriptome and clinical information of LUAD were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. A total of 1382 genes involved in regulating 13 various PCD patterns (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, netotic cell death, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, parthanatos, autophagy-dependent cell death, oxeiptosis, alkaliptosis and disulfidptosis) were included in the study. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were performed to identify PCD-associated differential expression genes (DEGs). An unsupervised consensus clustering algorithm was used to explore the potential subtypes of LUAD based on the expression profiles of PCD-associated DEGs. Univariate Cox regression analysis, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, Random Forest (RF) analysis and stepwise multivariate Cox analysis were performed to construct a prognostic gene signature. The “oncoPredict” algorithm was utilized for drug-sensitive analysis. GSVA and GSEA were utilized to perform function enrichment analysis. MCPcounter, quanTIseq, Xcell and ssGSEA algorithms were used for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. A nomogram incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics was established to predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.ResultsForty PCD-associated DEGs related to LUAD were obtained by WGCNA analysis and differential expression analysis, followed by unsupervised clustering to identify two LUAD molecular subtypes. A programmed cell death index (PCDI) with a five-gene signature was established by machine learning algorithms. LUAD patients were then divided into a high PCDI group and a low PCDI group using the median PCDI as a cutoff. Survival and therapeutic analysis revealed that the high PCDI group had a poor prognosis and was more sensitive to targeted drugs but less sensitive to immunotherapy compared to the low PCDI group. Further enrichment analysis showed that B cell-related pathways were significantly downregulated in the high PCDI group. Accordingly, the decreased tumor immune cell infiltration and the lower tumor tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) scores were also found in the high PCDI group. Finally, a nomogram with reliable predictive performance PCDI was constructed by incorporating PCDI and clinicopathological characteristics, and a user-friendly online website was established for clinical reference ( performed the first comprehensive analysis of the clinical relevance of genes regulating 13 PCD patterns in LUAD and identified two LUAD molecular subtypes with distinct PCD-related gene signature which indicated differential prognosis and treatment sensitivity. Our study provided a new index to predict the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and the prognosis of LUAD patients for guiding personalized treatments.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05000-w.",0
"AbstractGlioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive high-grade glioma that is fatal despite standard-of-care therapy. Recurrent somatic alterations that form neoantigens represent opportunities for targeted therapeutic intervention. Using human EGFRvIII as a prototypical structural alteration and neoantigen, we tested the potential of a mRNA-LNP vaccine approach to improve the survival of mice with EGFRvIII-driven GBM. To generate the model, we used in vivo electroporation to introduce genetic alterations (EGFRvIII-OE/CDKN2A-KO/PTEN-KO) into periventricular cells of early postnatal C3H mice, then propagated cells from the subsequent tumours to create implantable cell lines. Following orthotopic implantation, the resulting syngeneic tumours faithfully recapitulate histologic features of GBM with infiltrative growth, mitoses, necrosis, and vascular proliferation. Also like human GBM, the models are sensitive to but not cured by temozolomide chemotherapy and are resistant to immune checkpoint blockade. We delivered mRNA-LNP vaccines against EGFRvIII into the thigh muscle of tumour-bearing mice on days 7, 10, 14, 21, and 36 after tumour cell implant. We observed no tumour in vaccine-treated mice compared to significant tumour burden in control vector-treated animals by MR imaging at day 30 post-tumour cell implant. By day 37, all control-treated mice had died, whereas vaccine-treated mice cleared their tumours with no tumour burden detectable by histology at day 150 (N= 5 per group, **p= 0.0023). In a follow-up experiment with vaccine or control treatment on days 10, 14, 18, and 25 post-cell implants, all control mice had died by day 39. Further, vaccine-treated surviving animals were re-challenged with tumour cell implant into the contralateral hemisphere on day 42 and remain alive as of day 90. Our ongoing proof-of-principle work demonstrates that neoantigen driver mutations in high-grade glioma models can be targeted with an mRNA lipid vaccine. We hope this pre-clinical work will lead to early-phase clinical trials.","Aims: Anemia, mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width may have some effects on survival outcomes of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients and are incorporated in a red blood cell (RBC)-based score. Its validity in prognostication of mRCC patients treated with second-line nivolumab was assessed.Patients and methods: Retrospective analysis using Meet-URO-15 cohort of mRCC patients receiving nivolumab in the second-line setting or beyond. Outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).Results: A total of 390 patients were included. Significant differences in OS and PFS between RBC-based score groups, with group 1 (2 or 3 of the RBC-related prognostic factors) having longer OS (median 29.5 months, 95% CI: 23.1–35.9, versus 11.5 months, 95% CI: 8.5–22.6; p < 0.001) and PFS (7.5 months, 95% CI: 5.5–10.2, versus 4.2 months, 95% CI: 3.3–5.9; p = 0.040) than those in group 0 (0 or 1 RBC-related prognostic factors). Belonging to group 1 independently predicted OS (hazard ratio: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50–0.85; p = 0.002) but not PFS (hazard ratio: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.70–1.14, p = 0.370) or disease response (OR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.41–1.10; p = 0.118) at multivariable analysis.Conclusion: RBC-based group scores independently predicted OS in mRCC patients treated with nivolumab.",0
"AbstractINTRODUCTIONStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a cornerstone in the treatment of brain metastasis (BM), despite a known risk of distant intracranial failure (DIF). Recent imaging advances, specifically, sensitive 3D-FSE sequences, have started to be incorporated into SRS practice; however, comparisons of outcomes to historical imaging approaches are limited. We evaluated the impact of adding 3D-FSE to MPRAGE in BM detection and prolongation of DIF in a histology-agnostic patient group. METHODSOutcomes of patients treated with SRS for BM between 01/2019-01/2024 were evaluated. MPRAGE sequences were obtained for all; 3D-FSE sequences were implemented in 02/2020. Median times to DIF were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS215 patients underwent 332 SRS courses for 1456 BM imaged with MPRAGE and 3D-FSE (primary cohort), compared to the control cohort (92 patients, 135 SRS courses, 462 BM). MPRAGE sequences revealed 1636 lesions in 307 patients (462 in 92 control cohort, 1174 in 215 primary cohort). In the primary cohort, an additional 282 lesions were identified with 3D-FSE (24% increase) by neuroradiologists and multidisciplinary review. There was a statistically significant prolongation in the median time to DIF between the cohorts (11.4 vs. 6.8 months, p=0.029), most pronounced in the 1-4 metastases subgroup (14.7 vs. 8.1 months, p=0.008) and in those with a single BM (36.4 vs. 10.9 months, p=0.001). While patients relapsing on immunotherapy or targeted therapy did not significantly benefit from 3D-FSE (7.2 vs. 5.7 months, p=0.280), those who relapsed on chemotherapy or were off systemic therapy at least four weeks prior to SRS (including synchronous metastases) exhibited a trend towards longer time to DIF with 3D-FSE (14.7 vs. 7.9 months, p=0.057). CONCLUSIONS3D-FSE added to MPRAGE lengthens time to DIF via improving BM detection, especially for limited BM, and those relapsing on systemic therapy with limited intracranial penetration or no systemic therapy.","BackgroundAccounting for tumor heterogeneity, cancer stem cells (CSC) are involved in tumor metastasis, relapse, and drug resistance. Genes regulating CSC characteristics in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were explored and validated in this study.MethodsThe mRNA stemness index (mRNAsi) of more than 500 LUAD cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were calculated using a one-class logistic regression machine learning algorithm based on the mRNA expression of pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. mRNAsi-related key genes were identified by weighted correlation network analysis. The expression levels and prognostic roles of key genes were analyzed in Oncomine, PrognoScan, and Kaplan–Meier plotter databases, and validated using data from our center.ResultsThe mRNAsi was significantly higher in LUAD compared with normal lung tissues. LUAD patients of advanced stage exhibited a higher mRNAsi and worse overall survival (OS). Eight key genes were identified: heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSPA4), cell division cycle associated 7 (CDCA7), cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CAP-GLY domain containing linker protein 1 (CLIP1), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), H2A histone family, member X (H2AFX), and Bloom syndrome, RecQ helicase-like (BLM). These genes were differentially expressed in various types of malignancies and validated in the LUAD cases. LUAD patients with low expression of CDC20, CDK1, CCNB1, H2AFX, or BLM had a significantly better OS, whereas OS was reduced for patients with low expression of CLIP1. In addition, the expression of CDCA7 did not significantly impact the OS of LUAD patients. The protein–protein interaction networks evaluated by STRING demonstrated strong relationships between these key genes, which were validated in our cases.ConclusionsThe mRNAsi was significantly higher in LUAD compared with normal samples. Eight mRNAsi-related key genes were associated with prognosis and the cell cycle, and were strongly correlated with each other and differentially expressed in tumor and normal samples. We provide a new strategy for exploring stemness-related genes in LUAD cases.",0
"Background.There is evidence suggesting that COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with small, transitory effects on uterine bleeding, possibly including menstrual timing, flow, and duration, in some individuals. However, changes in health care seeking, diagnosis, and workup for abnormal uterine bleeding in the COVID-19 vaccine era are less clear.Objectives.To assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation in a large integrated health system.Study Design.Using segmented regression, we assessed whether the availability of COVID-19 vaccines was associated with changes in monthly, population-based rates of incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses compared to the pre-pandemic period in health system members ages 16–44 years who were not menopausal. We also compared clinical and demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with incident abnormal uterine bleeding between December 2020 through October 13, 2021 by vaccination status (never vaccinated, vaccinated in the 60 days prior to diagnosis, vaccinated more than 60 days prior to diagnosis) and conducted detailed chart review of patients diagnosed with abnormal uterine bleeding within 1–60 days of COVID-19 vaccination in the same time period.Results.In monthly populations ranging from 79,000 to 85,000 female health system members, incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis per 100,000 person-days ranged from 8.97 to 19.19. There was no significant change in the level or trend in the incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses between the pre-pandemic (January 2019-January 2020) and post-COVID-19 vaccine (December 2020-December 2021) periods. A comparison of clinical characteristics of 2,717 abnormal uterine bleeding cases by vaccination status suggested that abnormal bleeding among recently vaccinated patients was similar or less severe than abnormal bleeding among patients who had never been vaccinated patients or those vaccinated more than 60 days prior. There were also significant differences in age and race of patients with incident abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses by vaccination status: never vaccinated patients were the youngest and those vaccinated more than 60 days prior were the oldest; the proportion of patients who were Black/African American was highest among never vaccinated patients, and the proportion of Asian patients was higher among vaccinated patients. Chart review of 114 confirmed post-vaccination abnormal uterine bleeding cases diagnosed from December 2020 through October 13, 2021 found that the most common symptoms reported were changes in timing, duration, and volume of bleeding. Approximately one-third of cases received no diagnostic workup; 57% had no etiology for the bleeding documented in the electronic health record. In 12% of cases, the patient mentioned or asked about a possible link between their bleeding and their recent COVID-19 vaccine.Conclusions.The availability of COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with a change in incidence of medically attended abnormal uterine bleeding in our population of over 79,000 female patients of reproductive age. Additionally, among 2,717 patients with abnormal uterine bleeding diagnoses in the period following COVID-19 vaccine availability, receipt of the vaccine was not associated with greater bleeding severity.","AbstractClinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have benefited many cancer patients but failed in a number of tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. The main obstacle for ICI efficacy in GBM is the continuously evolving tumor microenvironment (TME), in which antitumor immunity is inhibited or eluded by tumor-secreted factors. Accumulation and reprogramming of myeloid cells (GAMs) creates a “cold” immunosuppressive TME with a poor infiltration and exhaustion of effector T cells. We employ Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) with 40 protein markers along with spatial transcriptomics and immunophenotyping to dissect identities and functionalities of immune cells (CD45+) in experimental GL261 gliomas. The results revealed identities of immune cells instrumental for creating the immunosuppressive milieu and cell-cell communication networks. We have developed a designer RGD peptide that blocks the reprogramming of GAMs by targeting tumor-GAMs interactions. We demonstrate that RGD efficiently blocks microglia-dependent invasion of murine and human glioma cells in vitro. We explored if the intratumorally delivered RGD can revert tumor-induced changes in the TME of experimental gliomas and improve anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. While RGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in vivo, it prevented reprogramming of myeloid cells into protumoral GAMs and led to the normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining RGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, increase in percentages of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of GAMs were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME which resulted in boosting immunotherapy responses. Intratumorally delivered RGD modified in the same way functionalities of GAMs in the TME of human U87MG gliomas in nude mice. Our results demonstrate that the integrin blockade combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors reinvigorates both innate and adaptive antitumor immunity. The results pave the way to improve responses to immunotherapy in GBM and other cancers.",0
"ABSTRACTHepatic schistosomiasis is a neglected parasitosis that affects millions of people each year worldwide and leads to high healthcare costs and increased morbidity and mortality in infected humans. It is a disease that has been widely studied in terms of its pathophysiology; therefore, the signaling pathways that lead to liver damage, with the consequent development of liver fibrosis, are now better understood. Research has elucidated the role of soluble egg antigen in the development of hepatic granulomas and liver fibrosis, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and its participation in liver damage, the role of heat shock protein 47 and its involvement in liver fibrosis, the anti-inflammatory effects caused by interleukin-37, and the role of natural killer and natural killer T cells in the development of the disease. Hepatic schistosomiasis can range from simple hepatomegaly to the development of portal hypertension combined with hepatic fibrosis. For diagnostic purposes, a microscopic examination of excreta remains the gold standard; however, abdominal ultrasound has recently taken on an important role in the assessment of liver lesions produced by the parasite. Praziquantel is considered the management drug of choice, and has been associated with a potential preventive antifibrotic effect.","Background: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) after a long latent infection. HTLV-1 induces the indolent or aggressive type of leukemia in 5% of HTLV-1 carriers. ATL, especially the aggressive type, is resistant to multi-agent chemotherapy. The indolent type often progresses to the aggressive type. Even in the most indolent-type cases, that is, smoldering ATL, the average survival time is 55.0 months. Case Presentation: Five patients with ATL were followed up for their clinical course after amplified natural killer cell (ANK) therapy. Four patients who received ANK therapy as first-line therapy achieved complete remission and showed long-term survival without aggressive conversion or relapse for more than 5 years. One patient was treated with multiagent chemotherapy due to acute exacerbation but relapsed 2 months later. She was subsequently treated with radiation and ANK therapy and survived for more than 6 years. Furthermore, ANK therapy enhanced the immune function of ATL patients to a level higher than that of normal individuals. Conclusions: ANK therapy has great potential as first-line treatment for ATL.",0
"IntroductionLittle is known about the long-term effects on sexual function (SF) after radical cystectomy (RC) in bladder carcinoma (BC) patients.AimTo assess the course of SF in BC patients who underwent RC, and individual characteristics that influence the sexual outcome during a six-year follow-up.MethodsIn this longitudinal study, 62 BC patients treated with RC were included between 2008 and 2022. Patients filled out validated questionnaires as part of the regular care at baseline, three months, six months, 12 months and thereafter yearly post RC.Outcome measuresTo determine the sexual function, the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire was filled in and a linear mixed model for repeated measures was conducted. The analysed clinical variables included sexual preserving cystectomy (SPC), age, type of diversion, treatment, comorbidities, tumour status, smoking habits, patient status and open- or robot-assisted RC. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model was used to evaluate the impact on Quality of Life with the QLQ-C30 questionnaire.ResultsAfter an initial decrease of sexual function post-RC, no change in SF was seen during the six years of follow-up. A statistically significant difference in sexual health was found between SPC and standard RC (p=0.015), which was time-dependent. Patients with an orthotopic ileal neobladder experienced a significantly better SF than those with a Bricker’s ileal conduit (p=<0.001). A younger age also seemed to yield beneficial outcomes regarding SF (p=0.004). Other analysed clinical variables did not influence the course of SF. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between Quality of Life- and SF scores (p=0.004). Robot-assisted RC resulted in higher Global Health scores than open RC (p=0.001).ConclusionsRC has a severe impact on sexual function. Although SPC, collinear with the use of an orthotopic ileal neobladder and younger patient age show better outcomes in SF, erectile dysfunction post-RC is moderate to severe in the vast majority of patients.","Background: Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs have crucial regulatory roles in molecular pathways, and their dysregulation is associated with the pathogenesis of malignancies such as Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Therefore, we aimed to study the NEAT1 and CHROMR expression in DLBCL and explore their association with clinicopathological characteristics.Methods & materials: DLBCL and non-tumor lymph node specimens were obtained to assess the expression levels.Results: NEAT1 and CHROMR expressions were significantly increased in DLBCL, and were linked with the age of DLBCL patients (aged >60). NEAT1 and CHROMR overexpression may serve as moderate-to-good diagnostic biomarkers, with NEAT1 and CHROMR exhibiting area under the curve values of 0.781 and 0.831, respectively.",0
"Background:Metastatic melanoma of the ampulla of Vater is rare. The purpose of this study was to summarize the characteristics and outcomes of metastatic melanoma in the ampulla of Vater and highlight the impact of surgery on the prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma.Methods:Pooled data from a case encountered at our institution and from all sporadic cases published on PubMed and MEDLINE between 1996 and 2023 were analyzed.Results:Fourteen patients with metastatic melanoma in the ampulla of Vater were enrolled. Ten (73%) of primary melanomas were cutaneous and two were mucosal. Jaundice was the most common symptom (86%). The size of metastatic melanoma to the ampulla ranged from 1.5 to 8 cm, with a median of 2.75 cm. Concomitant metastasis to other organs occurred in 82% of the patients at the time of diagnosis, most commonly in the brain, lungs, and liver (36% each). Among the reported cases, pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in five patients. The overall 1-year survival rate was 27.3%, with a median survival of 4 months. Wide excision of the primary lesion and chemotherapy significantly improved survival rates (50% vs. 0%, p = 0.048).Conclusion:There may be a trend toward improved survival in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by chemotherapy. Given the availability of effective systemic therapies, metastatic melanoma of the ampulla of Vater does not necessarily preclude major surgeries.","ABSTRACTBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are first-line treatment for melanoma. The incidence of musculoskeletal immune-related adverse events (MSK irAEs) remains unclear.ObjectiveTo estimate the relative risk of MSK irAEs in melanoma patients treated with ICIs targeting programmed cell death-1 or its ligand PD-(L)1 as compared to placebo.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature review including phase III randomized controlled trials of adult melanoma patients comparing a PD-(L)1 inhibitor to a placebo arm. Outcomes of interest included arthralgias, arthritis, back pain and myalgias. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled relative risk of MSK irAEs over the treatment course.ResultsFour RCTs met the inclusion criteria (n = 3,041 subjects). Use of PD-(L)1 inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of developing arthralgias (RR 1.30 [95% CI: 1.13–1.49]) and myalgias (RR 1.48 [95% CI: 1.17–1.87]) as compared to placebo. Back pain and arthritis were not reported.ConclusionsUse of PD-(L)1 inhibitors is associated with a significantly increased risk of arthralgias and myalgias in melanoma patients. The risk of back pain and arthritis is unknown.Implications for practiceMSK irAEs can impact quality of life and should be considered, particularly in the adjuvant setting when risks and benefits are carefully weighed.",1
"Abstract This study provides an analysis of 37 ovarian Sertoli–Leydig cell tumors (SLCT), focusing on their morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features. The cohort was comprised of 9 well-differentiated, 25 moderately differentiated, and 3 poorly differentiated tumors. The immunohistochemical analysis was performed with 28 markers, including diagnostic markers and markers with possible predictive significance. The results showed high expression of sex cord markers (FOXL2, SF1, inhibin A, CD99, calretinin, ER, PR, AR), and variable expression of other markers such as CKAE1/3 (83%), CAIX (14%), and MUC4 (1%). Loss of PTEN expression was present in 14% of cases, and CTLA4 expression was seen in 43% of cases. All tumors were MMR proficient and HER2 and PD-L1 negative. The molecular analysis showed DICER1 mutations in 54.5% of cases, and a FOXL2 mutation in 6% of tumors. In addition, we detected 2 cases with TERT promoter mutation. RNA NGS sequencing identified significant differences in mRNA expression between DICER1MUT and DICER1WT tumors. The DICER1WT tumors showed increased expression of PRKCA, HNF1A, LDLR, and MAP2K5. On the contrary, the DICER1MUT cases showed increased expression of CDK6, NOTCH2, and FGFR2. The results of our study show that SLCTs exhibit distinct molecular features based on their degree of differentiation. We have confirmed that DICER1 mutations are characteristic of moderately and poorly differentiated SLCTs, while well-differentiated SLCTs may represent a distinct entity. DICER1MUT and DICER1WT tumors showed different mRNA expression profiles. The FOXL2 mutation is less common in these tumors and is mutually exclusive with the DICER1 mutation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00428-024-03984-5.","PurposeTyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) improve the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the factors affecting its clinical efficacy remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the correlation between Osteopontin (OPN) and EGFR, and explore the inhibitory effect of first-generation TKI gefitinib on LUAD cells.MethodsThe correlation between OPN and EGFR was determined through bioinformatics technology, and the clinical information as well as samples of related patients were collected to verify the relationship between them. Using three different NSCLC cell lines A549, H1299 and PC9, we studied the effects of OPN expression and EGFR phosphorylation on the first-generation TKI’s efficacy in vitro.ResultsOur data revealed that OPN staining positively linked to a more advanced clinical stage. Compared with the control group, LUAD cells with elevated OPN levels are more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of TKI. Knocking down of OPN decreased the response of cells to gefitinib. Besides, OPN also upregulated the phosphorylation of EGFR, thereby affecting the effect of TKI.ConclusionOPN enhanced the sensitivity of LUAD cells to gefitinib by promoting EGFR phosphorylation. OPN may be a potential target for evaluating TKI efficacy and a potential target for molecular therapy.",0

"ABSTRACTPatients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have very poor long-term outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can potentially cure some of these patients who are able to achieve a second or greater remission with salvage chemotherapy. Unfortunately, several barriers exist to transplantation and not all patients with r/r AML are able to proceed to allo-SCT. Therefore, novel therapies to decrease the risk of relapse in these patients are urgently needed. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein has emerged as an encouraging vaccine target in AML due to its overexpression in leukemic blast cells and near absence in normal hematopoietic cells. Maintenance therapy with galinpepimut-S, a multivalent heteroclitic WT1 peptide vaccine, holds promise in early phase trials, in patients with AML by inducing a strong innate immune response against the WT1 antigen, leading to the design of this international, open-label, randomized clinical trial, named REGAL. Clinical trial registration:  The clinical trial identifier is NCT04229979.","AbstractCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines reduce severe disease and mortality and may lessen transmission, measured by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load (VL). Evaluating vaccine associations in VL at COVID-19 diagnosis in 4 phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled vaccine trials, July 2020 to July 2021, VL reductions were 2.78 log10 copies/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–4.18; n = 60 placebo, 11 vaccine) and 2.12 log10 copies/mL (95% CI, 1.44–2.80; n = 594 placebo, 36 vaccine) for NVX-CoV2373 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Associations were not significant for AZD1222 (0.59 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, −.19 to 1.36; n = 90 placebo, 78 vaccine) or Ad26.COV2.S (0.23 log10 copies/mL; 95% CI, −.01 to .47; n = 916 placebo, 424 vaccine).

"AbstractBackgroundHormone receptor–positive (HR+) breast cancer responds poorly to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In some settings, radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to mediate immunostimulatory effects and promote ICI sensitivity.MethodsWe investigated whether hypofractionated RT may be successfully combined with ICIs in a mouse model of multifocal, metachronous HR+ mammary carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that focal RT targeting the first detectable (primary) tumor combined with ICIs may generate effective immunity, delaying the development of new lesions.ResultsFocal RT in various doses and fractionations limited primary tumor growth, with an optimum for a 20-Gy × 2 regimen (ablative in approximately 90% of mice). The degree of primary disease control, however, did not necessarily correlate with overall survival extension because of changes in the development of new neoplastic lesions contributing to global tumor burden. Adding a PD-1 blocker to focal RT delivered in a 10-Gy × 3, 20-Gy × 2, or 8-Gy × 6 regimen failed to alter overall survival extension enabled by RT alone. Similar results were obtained with a CTLA4 blocker, an IL-1β inhibitor, and a PD-1 blocker plus recombinant FLT3LG when combined with the 10-Gy × 3 regimen.ConclusionsIn this model of HR+ mammary carcinogenesis, RT to the primary tumor ameliorates overall survival (to an extent based on dose and fractionation). Increasing local control through RT alone or RT plus immunotherapy beyond a hitherto undefined threshold, however, does not necessarily inhibit the development of subsequent nonirradiated neoplasms and hence does not necessarily provide extra overall survival benefits.","Effective cellular therapy using CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells for the treatment of advanced B-cell malignancies raises the question of whether the administration of adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) posttransplant could reduce relapse and improve survival. Moreover, several early phase clinical studies have shown the potential beneficial effects of administration of tumor-associated antigen-specific T-cells and natural killer cells posttransplant for high-risk patients, aiming to decrease relapse and possibly improve survival. In this article, we present an in-depth review of ACT after transplantation, which has the potential to significantly improve the efficacy of this procedure and revolutionize this field.",0
"Aim: Arsenic has excellent anti-advanced liver cancer effects through a variety of pathways, but its severe systemic toxicity forces the need for a safe and effective delivery strategy.Methods: Based on the chelating metal ion properties of polydopamine (PDA), arsenic was immobilized on an organic carrier, and a M1-like macrophage cell membrane (MM)-camouflaged manganese-arsenic complex mesoporous polydopamine  nanoplatform was successfully constructed.  was evaluated at the cellular level for tumor inhibition and tumor localization, and in vivo for its anti-liver cancer effect in a Hepa1-6 tumor-bearing mouse model.Results: The nanoplatform targeted the tumor site through the natural homing property of MM, completely degraded and released drugs to kill tumor cells in an acidic environment, while playing an immunomodulatory role in promoting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) repolarization.Conclusion:  has synergistically enhanced the targeted therapeutics against liver cancer via nanotechnology and immunotherapy, and it is expected to become a safe and multifunctional treatment platform in clinical oncology.","Aim: Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx (COCO) often exhibit signs of immunosuppression, affecting their prognosis.

"Background:In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) revolution is rapidly moving from metastatic to early-stage, however, the impact of clinicopathological variables and optimal treatment sequencing remain unclear.Methods:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with ICI as single agent or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (PCT) were included. Primary outcomes were pathological complete response (pCR), event free survival (EFS) (neoadjuvant/perioperative), and disease-free survival (DFS) (adjuvant). Secondary outcomes were major pathological response (MPR), overall survival (OS), toxicity, surgical outcomes (neoadjuvant/perioperative); OS and toxicity (adjuvant). An additional secondary endpoint was to compare EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative strategies.Results:8 RCTs (2 neoadjuvant, 4 perioperative, 2 adjuvant) (4661 participants) were included. Neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI+PCT significantly improved pCR, EFS, OS, MPR and R0 resection compared to PCT. Adjuvant ICI significantly improved DFS compared to placebo. There was a significant subgroup interaction by PD-L1 status (χ2 = 10.72, P = 0.005), pCR (χ2 = 17.80, P < 0.0001), and stage (χ2 = 4.46, P = 0.003) for EFS. No difference according to PD-L1 status was found for pCR, with 14% of patients having PD-L1 negative tumors still experiencing a pCR. No interaction by PD-L1 status was found for DFS upon adjuvant ICI. Indirect comparison showed no difference in EFS and OS between neoadjuvant and perioperative ICI+PCT.Conclusions:PD-L1 status, pCR and stage impact on survival upon neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI. The restriction of neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI to PD-L1 + patients could preclude pCR and long-term benefit in the PD-L1-subgroup. Neoadjuvant and perioperative could be equivalent strategies.","AbstractIntroductionAdjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluated the effects of adjuvant ICI treatment duration on RFS and overall survival (OS) among patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence.MethodsThe RFS and OS of patients from three centers who received either adjuvant ICI therapy or active surveillance after curative hepatic resection between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, were analyzed. Further analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of ICI treatment duration on RFS and OS.ResultsA total of 1,271 patients were included, of whom 1,032 (81.2%) received active surveillance and 239 (18.8%) received adjuvant ICI therapy. The median RFS in the adjuvant therapy cohort was 22.6 months (95% CI 18.3–26.9), significantly higher than the RFS of 19.1 months (95% CI 16.4–21.4) in the active surveillance cohort (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66–0.95; p = 0.019). The median OS was not reached for either group, but OS tended to be better in the adjuvant therapy cohort than in the active surveillance group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.94; p = 0.010). Similar results were obtained after propensity score matching. Among patients who received adjuvant ICI therapy, those who received it for longer than 6 months had slightly higher RFS (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42–1.04; p = 0.071) and OS (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.30–1.17; p = 0.128) than those who received it for up to 6 months.ConclusionsAdjuvant ICI therapy significantly improves the prognosis of patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after curative resection. Six months of adjuvant ICI treatment may be insufficient.",1
"AbstractBackground:B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy yield remarkable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/RMM). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) reportedly exhibits distinct advantages in addressing the challenges posed by tumor heterogeneity in the distribution and genetic variations in R/RMM.Methods:Herein, the ctDNA of 108 peripheral blood plasma samples from patients with R/RMM at the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University was thoroughly investigated before administration of anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy to establish its predictive potential. Flow cytometry is used primarily to detect subgroups of T cells or CAR-T cells.Results:In this study, several tumor and T cell effector-mediated factors were considered to be related to treatment failure by an integrat analysis, including higher percentages of multiple myeloma (MM) cells in the bone marrow (P = 0.0125), lower percentages of CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood at peak (P = 0.0375), and higher percentages of CD8+ T cells (P = 0.0340). Furthermore, there is a substantial correlation between high ctDNA level (>143 ng/mL) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.007). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high levels of ctDNA (>143 ng/mL), MM-driven high-risk mutations (including IGLL5 [P = 0.004], IRF4 [P = 0.024], and CREBBP [P = 0.041]), number of multisite mutations, and resistance-related mutation (ERBB4, P = 0.040) were independent risk factors for PFS.Conclusion:Finally, a ctDNA-based risk model was built based on the above independent risk factors, which serves as an adjunct non-invasive measure of substantial tumor burden and a prognostic genetic feature that can assist in predicting the response to anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy.Registeration:Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100046474) and National Clinical Trial (NCT04670055, NCT05430945).","Lung cancer patient education resources that address barriers to health literacy, improve understanding, and demonstrate improved patient outcomes are limited.

"AbstractBackgroundWhile vaccine antigen-induced antibodies are often used as proxies for vaccine efficacy, immune responses to vaccine vectors are less well-defined. We describe the kinetics of immunoglobulin (IgG) responses against the vector (vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus [VSIV]) nucleoprotein (N) and the inserted antigen (Ebola virus [EBOV]) glycoprotein (GP1,2) components of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and evaluate their use as biomarkers to confirm self-reported vaccination status.MethodsWe selected 212 participants randomized to rVSV-ZEBOV (n = 107) or placebo (n = 105). Levels of IgG antibodies to EBOV GP1,2 or VSIV N were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a newly developed single-molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay, respectively.ResultsAnti-EBOV GP1,2 and anti-VSIV N IgG were first detected 10-14 days postvaccination, further increased at 28 days, and remained stable through 360 days. Antibody titers were significantly correlated (P < 0.001) at 28 days (r = 0.47), 180 days (r = 0.45), and 360 days (r = 0.59). At 28 days, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) discriminated vaccinated from unvaccinated patients with high accuracy (AUC = 0.965 for anti-VSIV N IgG; AUC = 0.945 for anti-EBOV GP1,2 IgG [P < 0.001]).ConclusionsWe report a reliable assay to measure vector-induced humoral responses after rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination and demonstrate the assay's utility to confirm vaccination status.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a tropical disease that can be fatal if acute and untreated. Diagnosis is difficult, the treatment is toxic and prophylactic vaccines do not exist. Leishmania parasites express hundreds of proteins and several of them are relevant for the host's immune system. In this context, in the present study, 10 specific T-cell epitopes from 5 parasite proteins, which were identified by antibodies in VL patients’ sera, were selected and used to construct a gene codifying the new chimeric protein called rCHI. The rCHI vaccine was developed and thoroughly evaluated for its potential effectiveness against Leishmania infantum infection. We used monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and polymeric micelles (Mic) as adjuvant and/or delivery system. The results demonstrated that both rCHI/MPLA and rCHI/Mic significantly stimulate an antileishmanial Th1-type cellular response, with higher production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12 and nitrite in vaccinated animals, and this response was sustained after challenge. In addition, these mice significantly reduced the parasitism in internal organs and increased the production of IgG2a isotype antibodies. In vivo and in vitro toxicity showed that rCHI is safe for the mammalians, and the recombinant protein also induced in vitro lymphoproliferative response and production of Th1-type cytokines by human cells, which were collected from healthy subjects and treated VL patients. These data suggest rCHI plus MPLA or micelles could be considered as a vaccine candidate against VL.",1
"PurposeAlthough immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to be effective in many clinical trials, real-world data remain limited. We investigated the outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received nivolumab, with an emphasis on hyper-progressive disease (HPD).MethodsThis retrospective study enrolled stage IV NSCLC patients who received nivolumab after progression on prior chemotherapy between July 2016 and June 2018 at a single center in Korea. HPD was defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors as progression at the first evaluation, with a ≥ two-fold increase in the tumor growth rate during nivolumab treatment.ResultsA total of 83 patients with a median age of 60 years were enrolled [squamous, 25(30%) and non-squamous, 58(70%)]. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82–4.31] and 8.6 months (95% CI 5.56–11.59), respectively. HPD developed in 16 (19.2%). The median OS of HPD patients was 2.2 months (95% CI 0.92–3.75) compared with 4.1 months for progressive disease (PD) patients without HPD (95% CI 1.54–6.67). Among patients with pleura or pericardium metastasis, increased effusion was seen more frequently in HPD patients compared with PD patients without HPD [90% (9/10) vs. 28.6% (4/14); p = 0.005]. HPD patients also showed a significant decrease in circulating albumin after treatment with nivolumab (p = 0.030).ConclusionAlthough the efficacy of nivolumab in real-world patients was comparable to that seen in clinical trials, clinicians should be aware of HPD because it is not uncommon and represents a worse prognosis.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00432-020-03293-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Hepatic sarcomatoid carcinoma (HSC) is characterized by its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. As of now, no universally endorsed standard therapeutic approaches for HSC have been established. Herein, we describe the case of a 60-year-old individual diagnosed with HSC, subsequently presenting with multiple metastases postoperatively. Owing to the pronounced expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), the individual was subjected to monotherapy utilizing sintilimab for a duration spanning 12 months. Following this regimen, a synergistic treatment approach comprising both anlotinib and sintilimab was instituted, culminating in an ensuing 11 months of efficacious therapeutic response. Throughout the course of treatment, the patient's quality of life remained satisfactory. This particular therapeutic strategy not merely reinforces the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in the realm of HSC management, but more pivotally, suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) might counteract resistance to PD-1 antagonists, thus offering a potentially augmented treatment paradigm for HSC.",1
"Aim: Studies on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related potential neurological adverse events (pNAEs) in Korean lung cancer (LC) patients are scarce. We aimed to examine ICI prescription trends from 2018 to 2022, patient characteristics and factors associated with ICI prescription or concurrent pNAEs in LC.Research design & methods: This observational, cross-sectional study of Korean LC patients investigated four ICIs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab). The annual ICI prescription rate was calculated by dividing the number of LC patients prescribed ICIs with the total annual number of LC patients. Factors associated with ICI prescriptions or concurrent pNAEs were assessed.Results: The annual ICI prescription rate increased from 3.29% to 9.74% (average: 6.20%). Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were associated with more ICI prescriptions (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.08). Targeted therapy was associated with fewer prescriptions (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.41–0.49). The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) prescription rate was higher in patients with concurrent pNAEs than those without pNAEs (53.09% vs. 50.84%), and this was associated with higher pNAEs prevalence (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03–1.18).Conclusion: ICI prescription for LC has increased in Korea, CCI and anti-PD-1 increased pNAEs prevalence.","AbstractBackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with severe immune-related adverse events (s-irAEs) that result in hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, treatment discontinuation, or death. This study examined the impact of s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies on clinical outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsData were derived from ConcertAI Patient360 NSCLC, a US-based electronic medical record database, between January 2012 and May 2021. Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC and received ICI-containing therapy. s-irAEs and management actions were abstracted from unstructured EHR data from ICI initiation through the earliest of 100 days after ICI discontinuation, start of a non-ICI-containing regimen, loss to follow up, end of study period, or death. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between s-irAEs and their earliest management strategies, and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS).ResultsThe study included 3211 patients. Median (IQR) age was 67 (60-73) years, and 44.9% were female. Most patients (61.6%) initiated ICIs as first-line therapy; half (50.1%) initiated ICIs as monotherapy, with nivolumab monotherapy (29.5%) as the most common initial ICI-containing regimen in any line. Overall, 8.6% of patients experienced s-irAEs, most often diarrhea (3.5%), pneumonitis (1.4%), and rash (1.3%). Among patients who experienced at least one s-irAEs, over half (57.4%) were hospitalized, and 71.8% were treated with corticosteroids, any time after the occurrence of their first s-irAEs. Median rwPFS was 4.9 (95%CI, 4.6-5.2) months, and median rwOS was 13.6 (12.6-14.7) months from ICI initiation. rwPFS and rwOS were comparable between patients with s-irAEs vs patients without s-irAEs when s-irAEs were first managed with anti-cancer treatment interruptions. Patients with s-irAEs had a 53% (22.3%-91.4%) higher risk of death than patients without s-irAEs when s-irAEs initially required corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants, and a 61% (37.9%-87.9%) higher risk of death when s-irAEs first required hospitalization or ED admission.ConclusionThe impact of s-irAEs on clinical outcomes may depend on the initial intervention required to manage the adverse event. s-irAEs were associated with worse outcomes when they initially required hospital/ED admission, corticosteroids, or other immunosuppression.",1
"AbstractHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most prevalent and dangerous cancers in the world, which is associated with hepatitis and fibrosis resulting from different etiologies, such as hepatitis B and C virus, alcohol and diabetes. Chronic inflammation is suggested to promote tumorigenesis and progression by producing inflammatory cytokines and free radicals, triggering malignant transformation of cells, promoting tumor cells proliferation and inducing tumor angiogenesis. Immunosuppressive microenvironment established in the liver also plays a vital role in HCC development. The mechanisms include activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts, upregulation of pattern recognition receptors, inhibition of effector T cells, recruitment of regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, activation of hepatic stellate cells and immunosuppressive M2 macrophages. In this review, we will summarize the most recent studies and discuss the advanced mechanisms of chronic inflammatory microenvironment and immunosuppressive microenvironment promoting HCC development, aiming to explore potential therapeutic targets.","AbstractPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease for which remarkable therapeutic resistance is the norm. Conventional immunotherapies, like immune checkpoint inhibitors, show limited efficacy in PDA due to a remarkably immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and systemic inflammation. This review discusses the potential of both exogenous and in situ vaccination strategies to overcome these barriers and enhance anti-tumor immunity in PDA. Exogenous vaccines, including whole-cell, dendritic cell, peptide, and nucleic acid-based vaccines, have shown varying degrees of promise but face challenges related to antigen selection, production complexities, and patient-specific factors. In contrast, in situ vaccination strategies leverage conventional cytotoxic therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, to induce immunogenic cell death and modulate the TME with the aim to stimulate anti-tumor immunity. While preclinical studies support the use of in situ vaccination, balancing the stimulatory and inhibitory effects is likely fundamental to eliciting productive anti-tumor responses in patients. Ongoing research seeks to identify new innovative strategies that can harness the endogenous immune response and trigger in situ vaccination. Overall, while both vaccination approaches offer significant potential, further research and clinical trials will be needed to optimize these strategies for improving patient outcomes in PDA.",1
"PurposeIn the complex tumor scenario, understanding the function of proteins with protumor or antitumor roles is essential to support advances in the cancer clinical area. Among them, the salvador family WW domain-containing protein 1 (SAV1) is highlighted. This protein plays a fundamental role in the tumor suppressor face of the Hippo pathway, which are responsible for controlling cell proliferation, organ size, development and tissue homeostasis. However, the functional dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. As SAV1 is a tumor suppressor scaffold protein, we explored the functions performed by SAV1 with its partners, the regulation of its expression, and its antitumor role in various types of cancer.MethodsWe selected and analyzed 80 original articles and reviews from Pubmed that focuses on the study of SAV1 in cancer.ResultsSAV1 interacts with several proteins, has different functions and acts as tumor suppressor by other mechanisms besides Hippo pathway. SAV1 expression regulation seems to occur by microRNAs and rarely by mutation or promoter methylation. It is downregulated in different types of cancer, which leads to cancer promotion and progression and is associated with poor prognosis. In vivo models have shown that the loss of SAV1 contributes to tumorigenesis.ConclusionSAV1 plays a relevant role as tumor suppressor in several types of cancer, highlighting SAV1 and the Hippo pathway's importance to cancer. Thus, encouraging further studies to include the SAV1 as a molecular key piece in cancer biology and in clinical approaches to cancer.","Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts that play a role in numerous malignant phenotypes, including hyperproliferation, invasion, and metastasis. These phenotypes correlate with activity of the Hippo pathway oncoprotein, Yes-associated protein-1 (YAP1), and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). YAP1/TAZ are normally involved in organ growth, under the regulation of various kinases and upon phosphorylation, are retained in the cytoplasm by chaperone proteins, leading to their proteasomal degradation. In CAFs and tumor cells, however, a lack of YAP1 phosphorylation results in its translocation to the nucleus, binding to TEAD transcription factors, and activation of mitogenic pathways. In this review we summarize the literature discussing the central role of YAP1 in CAF activation, the upstream cues that promote YAP1-mediated CAF activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and how CAFs mediate tumor-stroma crosstalk to support progression, invasion and metastasis in various cancer models. We further highlight YAP1+CAFs functions in modulating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and propose evaluation of several YAP1 targets regarding their role in regulating intra-tumoral immune landscapes. Finally, we propose that co-administration of YAP1- targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with advanced tumors.",1
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor with significant global health implications. The role of CD4+ T cells, particularly conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), in HCC progression remains unexplored. Furthermore, epigenetic factors are crucial in immune regulation, yet their specific role in HCC-infiltrating Tconv cells remains elusive. This study elucidates the role of MATR3, an epigenetic regulator, in modulating Tconv activity and immune evasion within the HCC microenvironment. Reanalysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed that early activation of CD4+ T cells is crucial for establishing an antitumor immune response. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that Tconv enhances cDC1-induced CD8+ T-cell activation. Screening identified MATR3 as a critical regulator of Tconv function, which is necessary for antitumour activity but harmful when overexpressed. Excessive MATR3 expression exacerbates Tconv exhaustion and impairs function by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to relax chromatin in the TOX promoter region, leading to aberrant transcriptional changes. In summary, MATR3 is an HCC-specific epigenetic checkpoint that bidirectionally regulates Tconv antitumour immunity, suggesting new therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic regulators to enhance antitumour immunity in HCC.","Regulatory T cells (Tregs) establish dominant immune tolerance but obstruct tumor immune surveillance, warranting context-specific mechanistic insights into the functions of tumor-infiltrating Tregs (TIL-Tregs). We show that enhanced posttranslational O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) of cellular factors is a molecular feature that promotes a tumor-specific gene expression signature and distinguishes TIL-Tregs from their systemic counterparts. We found that altered glucose utilization through the glucose transporter Glut3 is a major facilitator of this process. Treg-specific deletion of Glut3 abrogates tumor immune tolerance, while steady-state immune homeostasis remains largely unaffected in mice. Furthermore, by employing mouse tumor models and human clinical data, we identified the NF-κB subunit c-Rel as one such factor that, through Glut3-dependent O-GlcNAcylation, functionally orchestrates gene expression in Tregs at tumor sites. Together, these results not only identify immunometabolic alterations and molecular events contributing to fundamental aspects of Treg biology, specifically at tumor sites but also reveal tumor-specific cellular properties that can aid in the development of Treg-targeted cancer immunotherapies.",1
"PurposeAs a novel antiangiogenic multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved in China, anlotinib has exhibited promising anticancer efficacy and acceptable safety profile in the salvage treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in clinical trials. Here we retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third- or further-line treatment in patients with refractory SCLC.Patients and methodsA total of 40 patients with refractory SCLC treated with anlotinib monotherapy were included in this study. The clinicopathological data, treatment information, survival data and safety data were retrospectively collected. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed by log-rank testing.ResultsAltogether, 40 patients of extensive-stage SCLC or progressive limited-stage SCLC received anlotinib monotherapy as third- or further-line treatment from July 2018 to June 2020. Four patients achieved partial response (PR), 14 patients achieved stable disease (SD), no complete response (CR) was recorded, and 22 patients experienced progressive disease (PD). The disease control rate (DCR) was 45.0%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.241–3.759), and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.8 months (95% CI 3.190–12.410). The common adverse effects (AEs) included hypertension, fatigue, anorexia, cough, rash and nausea. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 3 (7.5%) patients. One patient interrupted anlotinib treatment due to repeated grade 1 epistaxis. Univariate analysis revealed that patients without liver metastases, previously treated with radiotherapy or with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0 or 1 had longer OS with anlotinib treatment. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients without liver metastases and patients with ECOG score ≤ 1 had longer PFS, while patients without liver metastases had longer OS.ConclusionAnlotinib is beneficial to refractory SCLC as third- or further-line treatment, especially in patients without liver metastasis and with better physical status. Related adverse effects are tolerable and manageable.","BackgroundSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine cancer with a high risk of early mortality (that is, survival time less than 1 month). This study aimed to identify relevant risk factors and predict early mortality in SCLC patients.MethodsA total of 27,163 SCLC cases registered between 2010 and 2019 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Significant independent risk factors were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Nomograms for all-causes and cancer-specific early death were constructed and evaluated.ResultsAge, sex, clinical stage, presence of metastasis (liver and lung), and absence of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) were identified for significant association with all-causes and cancer-specific early death. Nomograms based on these predictors exhibited high accuracy (area under ROC curve > 0.850) and potential clinical practicality in the prediction of early mortality.ConclusionWe identified a set of factors associated with early mortality from SCLC and developed a clinically useful nomogram to predict high-risk patients. This nomogram could aid oncologists in the administration of individualized treatment regimens, potentially improving clinical outcomes of SCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-023-05003-7.",1
"Metastasis is the ultimate and often lethal stage of cancer. Metastasis occurs in three phases that may vary across individuals: First, dissemination from the primary tumor. Second, tumor dormancy at the metastatic site where micrometastatic cancer cells remain quiescent or, in dynamic cycles of proliferation and elimination, remaining clinically undetectable. Finally, cancer cells are able to overcome microenvironmental constraints for outgrowth, or the formation of clinically detectable macrometastases that colonize distant organs and are largely incurable. A variety of approaches have been used to model metastasis to elucidate molecular mechanisms and identify putative therapeutic targets. In particular, metastatic dormancy has been challenging to model in vivo due to the sparse numbers of cancer cells in micrometastasis nodules and the long latency times required for tumor outgrowth. Here, we review state-of-the art genetically engineered mouse, syngeneic, and patient-derived xenograft approaches for modeling metastasis and dormancy. We describe the advantages and limitations of various metastasis models, novel findings enabled by such approaches, and highlight opportunities for future improvement.","AbstractBackgroundEarly‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in adults is commonly treated with combined modality treatment of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The role of radiotherapy has been questioned due to potential long‐term adverse effects.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.Search methodsWe updated all previous searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, MEDLINE and Embase, in trial registries and in relevant conference proceedings until November 2023.Selection criteriaWe included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in adults with early‐stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and excluded trials with more than 20% of participants with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma. We considered immunotherapy in addition to chemotherapy eligible if both were applied similarly in the comparator groups, but did not identify such trials. For our comparisons, we separated RCTs with the same number of chemotherapy cycles in both arms and RCTs with a different number of cycles, when the chemotherapy regimens were the same. We separated RCTs which compared participants with a favourable, mixed or unfavourable risk profile.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of included trials. A third review author resolved discrepancies. We analysed time‐to‐event outcomes (overall survival, progression‐free survival) as hazard ratios (HR) and binary outcomes (adverse events) as risk ratios (RR). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.Main resultsWe included nine comparisons of eight RCTs involving 3840 participants in this updated review.Same number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseFor overall survival in individuals with favourable Hodgkin's lymphoma, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 7.92; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). Additional radiotherapy to chemotherapy is likely to improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.01 to 74.24; 2 RCTs, 1245 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and substantial imprecision) and suggests little to no difference in cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.16; 1 RCT, 667 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality or infertility.Mixed populationFor a population of mixed risk profile, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.80; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision). It indicates that additional radiotherapy may lead to an improvement in progression‐free survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; 2 RCTs, 572 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 10.87; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) and second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 572 participants) (both very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but suggests that additional radiotherapy may increase cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.92; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with unfavourable disease, the evidence on overall survival is uncertain and inconclusive (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.44; 2 RCTs, 688 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), but additional radiotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.60; 1 RCT, 651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to imprecision). The evidence was uncertain and inconclusive for cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.12 to 65.74; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality, second‐cancer related mortality or infertility.Different number of chemotherapy cycles in both trial armsFavourable diseaseThe evidence for overall survival in individuals with favourable disease treated with different numbers of chemotherapy cycles in both arms is uncertain and inclusive (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.38; 1 RCT, 357 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision), yet it suggests a likely improvement in progression‐free survival with additional radiotherapy (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 RCT, 357 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence due to study limitations). For second‐cancer‐related mortality, the evidence is uncertain and inconclusive (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.34; 1 RCT, 465 participants; very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infection‐related mortality and infertility and data for cardiac disease‐related mortality were not estimable (no events in either group).Unfavourable diseaseFor individuals with an unfavourable risk profile, additional radiotherapy may decrease overall survival slightly (HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.90; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision), but may slightly improve progression‐free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 698 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and imprecision). The evidence is uncertain and inconclusive for infection‐related mortality (RR 6.90, 95% CI 0.36 to 132.34; 1 RCT, 276 participants), second‐cancer‐related mortality (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.77 to 6.19; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) and cardiac disease‐related mortality (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 8.22; 2 RCTs, 870 participants) (all very low‐certainty evidence due to study limitations and substantial imprecision). There were no data on infertility.Authors' conclusionsThe chemotherapy regimens in the trials differed and data for regimens commonly used today were limited. Additional radiotherapy may slightly improve progression‐free survival. The available data for overall survival and adverse events were of low and very low certainty, and we were unable to draw conclusions about the effects of additional radiotherapy on these outcomes. No studies evaluated infertility. High‐quality, longer‐term follow‐up data are required and data on fertility are needed.",0
"PurposeThe optimal mode of neoadjuvant treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been well characterized. Our study compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) for patients with ESCC.MethodsData from ESCC patients receiving NCRT or NCT combined with esophagectomy between 2010 and 2018 from the National Cancer Center in China were retrospectively collected. Long-term survival, pathological response, and perioperative mortality and morbidity were compared between the NCRT and NCT groups. A Cox proportional hazards model and propensity score matching (PSM) were used to minimize bias due to potential confounding.ResultsOut of 327 eligible patients with ESCC in our study, 90 patients were identified in each group by PSM. The complete pathologic response (pCR) rate in the NCRT group was markedly higher than that in the NCT group (before PSM: 35.1% vs. 6.0%; after PSM: 38.9% vs. 5.6%; both P < 0.001). The rates of 30-day or 90-day mortality were comparable between the two groups, but the NCRT group had a longer postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.001 before PSM and P = 0.012 after PSM) and more postoperative complications (P < 0.001 before PSM and P = 0.014 after PSM), especially, anastomotic leaks (P = 0.001 before PSM and P = 0.013 after PSM). No significant differences in 5-year overall survival (OS) (P = 0.439) or 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.611) were noted between unmatched groups, but the trend favored NCRT in the propensity score-matched group (77.3% vs. 61.3%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–2.87; P = 0.141 for OS, and 77.8% vs. 60.5%; HR 1.72; 95% CI 0.95–3.11; P = 0.073 for RFS). Multivariate analysis showed that only ypT and ypN stages were independent predictors of OS before and after PSM (both P < 0.05).ConclusionThere was no difference in survival between the NCT and NCRT groups, although a trend favored NCRT related to the significantly higher pCR rates. Prospective head-to-head clinical trials to compare these two types of neoadjuvant therapies in ESCC are warranted.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-021-03659-7.","Purpose:Intravesical mitomycin-C is recommended immediately after transurethral resection of bladder tumor for nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, a lack of compliance occurs due to the associated complications. Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravesical mitomycin-C before transurethral resection of bladder tumor in patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer.Materials and Methods:This was a single-center, open-label, parallel-arm, randomized phase II clinical trial in patients with suspected nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer before transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2 doses of intravesical mitomycin-C (40 mg/20 mL) 1 day and 4 hours before transurethral resection of bladder tumor (n = 49) or no treatment (n = 50) with block randomization (size 2 and 4), stratified by bacillus Calmette-Guérin/intravesical mitomycin-C. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival and adverse events in the per-protocol analysis.Results:Seventy-one patients (33, intervention; 38, control) were well matched for baseline characteristics. Sixty-one had been followed without recurrence for at least 10.4 months; 3 and 8 patients showed recurrence in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The 1-year recurrence-free survival rate was 97% and 89% for the intervention and control groups, respectively. Neoadjuvant intravesical mitomycin-C resulted in a reduction (63%) in the relative recurrence risk (hazard ratio, 0.37; 80% 1-sided confidence interval, −∞-0.65, P = .11). Disease progression occurred in 3 patients in the control group (P = .051) but not in the intervention group. Neoadjuvant intravesical mitomycin-C was well tolerated, and adverse events were local and of grade 1/2.Conclusions:Two doses of neoadjuvant intravesical mitomycin-C are safe and effective in reducing nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer recurrence and progression after transurethral resection of bladder tumor.",0
"Our objective was to determine whether social media influences vaccination through informational and normative influences among Democrats and Republicans. We use a probability-based longitudinal study of Americans (N = 1768) collected between December 2022 and September 2023 to examine the prospective associations between social media use and vaccination as well as informational and normative influence as mediating processes. Greater social media use correlates with more frequent vaccination (cross-lagged coefficients: COVID-19 = 0.113, p < 0.001; influenza = 0.123, p < 0.001). The underlying processes, however, vary between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats who use social media more are more likely to vaccinate because they encounter information about new pathogens. In contrast, Republicans who use social media more are more likely to vaccinate because they think that people who are important to them receive the recommended vaccines. Our findings underscore the potential for social media campaigns to promote vaccination, among both Democrats and Republicans by paying attention to the specific processes in each audience.","BackgroundIndia, like many parts of Asia, likely faces a high burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), though large-scale data on etiology, presentation, and outcomes are lacking. There appears to be a predominance of unresectable, advanced-stage HCC at presentation in India with variable level of expertise in India to manage these scenarios. This publication summarizes the latest evidence with cognizance of the unique challenges faced in India by treating clinicians.MethodsA multidisciplinary panel of medical oncologists, gastroenterologists, hepatologists, interventional radiologists, and hepatobiliary surgical oncologists held a meeting in June 2022 and reviewed the evidence available for management of HCC. The meeting concentrated on the recognition and management of HCC not amenable to surgical approaches in the Indian context. A literature review of these aspects of management was conducted and consensus statements with level of evidence and grades of recommendation were prepared by individual specialists in each field. Statements were evaluated by the modified Delphi method.Key Content and FindingsThe panel comprising 22 experts formulated 40 consensus statements with regard to defining unresectable HCC, optimization of underlying conditions prior to management, rationale use of various liver-directed therapies (LDTs) in unresectable HCC, and systemic therapeutic options in this group of patients.ConclusionOur consensus statements offer practical, yet evidence-based management guidelines for treating unresectable HCC in the Indian context. There is an emphasis on the crucial need for combining available approaches for LDT, even if less well studied though possibly effective, with standard systemic therapy.",0
"Metabolic adaptation serves as a significant driving force for cancer growth and poses a substantial obstacle for cancer therapies. Herein, we unraveled the role of m6A-mediated serine synthesis pathway (SSP) regulation in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrated that treatment of highly specific m6A inhibitor (STM2457) effectively inhibited HCC cell line growth and suppressed spontaneous HCC formation in mice driven by liver-specific Tp53 knockout and Myc overexpression. Using GLORI-seq, we delineated a single-base-resolution m6A landscape in human HCC cell lines. Interestingly, we identified three core enzymes in the SSP (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH) as novel targets of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. In these SSP genes, m6A modification recruited m6A reader IGF2BP3 to stabilize their mRNA transcripts, thereby enhancing their mRNA and protein expression in HCC cells. Most importantly, our GLORI-seq data revealed that sorafenib-resistant HCC cells elevated m6A modification in SSP genes to promote protein expression and antioxidant production. STM2457 treatment attenuated the serine synthesis pathway, induced oxidative stress, and sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib and lenvatinib treatments. In conclusion, our findings suggest that targeting m6A could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","BackgroundThe m6A methylation modification is one of the most common mRNA modifications, and involved in a variety of biological processes, such as cell death, cancer stem cell formation and tumorigenesis. Increasing evidences have demonstrated that the expression patterns of m6A regulators are significantly correlated with PD-L1 level some solid tumors, but few study has explored the function of m6A regulators in the immune microenvironment and prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsSurvival analysis was independently conducted for 20 m6A regulators to explore their prognostic value in NSCLC, and then the prognostic risk model based on m6A regulator expression profiles is built to stratify NSCLC patients. Also, the correlation analysis between immune infiltrating cells and m6A regulators is used to reveal the impact of m6A on immune microenvironment of NSCLC. Furthermore, to explore the function of m6A as biomarker of anit-PD-L1 therapeutic effect, we explored the associations of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1 levels to 20 m6A regulator expression patterns in NSCLC.ResultsFirst, the expressions of 20 m6A regulators in NSCLC tissues were significantly increased compared to normal tissues. Survival analysis revealed that three genes, METTL3, HNRNPC and VIRMA, were markedly correlated to the prognosis of NSCLC patients. In particular, cox regression analysis verified that METTL3 could be used as an independent prognostic factor to predict the survival rate of NSCLC patients. Second, the risk prognostic model built on seven m6A regulators can effectively stratify NSCLC patients, and the low-risk subgroup had better prognosis compared to high-risk group. Finally, a few m6A regulators showed significant associations with immune microenvironment, as well as TMB and PD-L1 level, suggesting that the m6A RNA methylation is indicative of therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 treatment.ConclusionOur study identified some m6A regulatory factors as independent risk factors for the prognosis of NSCLC, and the expression patterns of m6A regulators are also correlated to the immune infiltration, as well as TMB and PD-L1 level in NSCLC. The m6A regulators could be used as biomarkers indicative of immunotherapy to NSCLC patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00432-022-04032-y.",0
